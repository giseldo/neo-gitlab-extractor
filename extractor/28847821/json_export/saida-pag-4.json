Users need to be able to read the main content.\n\n### Describe the Bug\nIn safari, when you make the viewport narrower than 1024px the nav switches to the mobile version. On the Why Ultimate and Why Premium pricing pages, there's a sidebar navigation that floats out from the right side and begins to overlap the content. As the screen gets smaller, the conent becomes unreadable because the sidebar nav is laying ontop. \n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-11-03_at_9.09.04_AM](/uploads/f071a6d5fa257667f06405114a3e3740/Screen_Shot_2022-11-03_at_9.09.04_AM.png)\n\nI discovered this while QA testing the [2.0 navigation MR for BE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/1271). These pages are now linked to directly from the footer. \n\nBut since this is a current bug in production, it's not blocking to the release of the 2.0 nav.\n\nThis is probably the case on other pages using that sidebar component.\n\n### What's my browser? \nhttps://www.whatsmybrowser.org/b/GSXCV\n\n## Page(s)\nWhich page(s) are involved in this request?\n* https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/premium/\n* https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ultimate/\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?

Add/remove rows as needed.\n\nOur SEO monitoring tool has detected an increase in page title changes, meta description changes and newly created pages in the /fr-fr/ folder. On closer inspection it seems like a majority of about.gitlab.com pages are duplicated in the `/fr-fr/` folder. \n\n**For example:**\n- Direction - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/direction/ops/\n- Security - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/security/cap/\n- Solutions - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/solutions/kubernetes/\n- Blog - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/blog/2016/09/26/infrastructure-update/\n- Topics - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/topics/gitops/ \n\nAt the time of creating this issue, over [1700 duplicate pages are now indexed in Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aabout.gitlab.com%2Ffr-fr%2F\u0026rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB900GB900\u0026biw=1280\u0026bih=919\u0026sxsrf=ALiCzsYafVY9WQdboMx1Vxx02vAmwHZVBQ%3A1666953051190\u0026ei=W69bY8WgC4eWhbIPp8OWsAE\u0026ved=0ahUKEwiFuuSD3IL7AhUHS0EAHaehBRYQ4dUDCA8\u0026uact=5\u0026oq=site%3Aabout.gitlab.com%2Ffr-fr%2F\u0026gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQA0oECEEYAUoECEYYAFCqB1iqB2C9CGgBcAB4AIABRIgBRJIBATGYAQCgAQHAAQE\u0026sclient=gws-wiz-serp) which is a major concern.\n\n### Duplicate Content SEO Implications\n\nDuplicate content is when you have URLs that have identical HTML content to at least one other indexable URL. If this sort of duplication occurs, you have a relatively serious issue, whereby URLs with identical content are accessible to search engine crawlers. If this results in large scale duplicate content issues on the site, you could trip quality algorithms like Google's Panda, which can depress organic search traffic to the site as a whole.\n\n\n**If this is urgent, what is the business need for the urgency?**\n- [ ]  Yes: `Prevent Google from penalizing our website`\n\nIf the requestor is not the DRI, find out if the DRI is aware of the request / wants to change things.\n\n**What is the ultimate end goal vision vs the MVC1 iteration?**\n - End goal for this MVC iteration is to removal all duplicate pages\n\n**How do we measure success?**\n - Reduction in duplicate pages indexed in Google.\n\n## Page(s)\nWhich page(s) are involved in this request?\n* Pages in the `/fr-fr/` folder\n\n## DCI\n[DRI, Consulted, Informed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci)\n\n- [ ] DRI: `GitLab Handle`\n- [ ] Consulted: `GitLab Handle`\n- [ ] Informed: `Everyone`\n\n## In scope\nWhat is within scope of this request?\n\n- [ ] Deliverable 1\n- [ ] Deliverable 2\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?
