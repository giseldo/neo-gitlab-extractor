It uses an unordered list `\u003cul\u003e` with buttons `\u003cbutton\u003e` as the child elements, but only list items are allowed so this also fails markup validation.\n- The **Support** dropdown can't be closed via keyboard, which also prevent focus from moving efficiently.\n\n## Solution\n\n- Use correct HTML semantics.\n- Ensure all functionality can be done via keyboard.\n- Ensure focus order is correct.\n- Ensure elements don't obscure other elements that can receive focus.\n\n![CleanShot_2022-04-27_at_09.21.17](/uploads/3ee1be62a44122f66955eb90b9bd1bdb/CleanShot_2022-04-27_at_09.21.17.mp4)\n\n## MVC 1\n\nFirst iteration MVC can be seen in this [merged MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/24).\n\n## What has been done\n\n- All unordered lists have been updated to only include list items as direct children elements.\n- Focus attributes of the footer section have been updated to be inaccesible whenever the Menu is open.\n\n## What still needs to be done\n\n- Although the links on the footer are hidden whenever the nav menu is open, as a user I cannot reach the submenus directly afterwards as the focus incorrectly goes to the top of the browser to start the page again. [This behavior can be seen here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/24#note_966838793).\n- The **Support** dropdown can only be closed by clicking `Support` again or navigating the whole menu. We would need to add a `Close` button inside that dropdown to have an actionable element with which we could close it with the keyboard.\n\n## MVC2\n\nFor the MVC2, an npm package [was tested here ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/34) but failed to work on production so it was rolled back and focus trap was implemented from scratch [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/45).\n\n## What has been done\n\nThe focus trap was created in the `navigation-desktop-menu.vue` file using DOM references. The npm packages for the focus trap have been removed from the repo. Focus trap should be working as expected now.\n\n## What still needs to be done\n\n- When `Close` button is clicked, focus should go to the latest focused nav item instead of the Support buttton (first button on page).","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-27T14:22:43.073Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T23:22:51.091Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T16:03:42.841Z","closed_by":{"id":4555518,"username":"laurenbarker","name":"Lauren

The reason for this is to distinguish identical links. For example, there are 2 \"hardened\" links under solutions block and value prop.\n\n* [x] hero\n* [x] benefits\n* [ ] quotes carousel\n* [x] solutions block\n* [ ] value prop\n* [x] case studies\n* [x] resource cards\n\nUpdate \"Start your free trial\" CTA button:\n\n* [x] `data-ga-name=\"free trial\"`\n\nUnder \"Security. Efficiency. Control.\", add data-ga-name/location to each Learn More link.\n\n* [x] `\u003ca data-ga-name=\"reduce security learn more\" data-ga-location=\"benefits\"\u003e`\n* [x] `\u003ca data-ga-name=\"free up learn more\" data-ga-location=\"benefits\"\u003e`\n* [x] `\u003ca data-ga-name=\"modernize learn more\" data-ga-location=\"benefits\"\u003e`\n\nAdd these data attributes to each toggle div section:  \n\n* [x] `\u003cdiv data-inbound-analytics=\"public-sector-leap-target\" data-toggle-group=\"example: Reduce security and compliance risk\" data-ga-toggle=\"expand or collapse\" class=\"accordion\"`\n\nAdd data attributes to the \"Trusted by government\" carousel per slide  \n\n* [x] `\u003cdiv data-ga-carousel=\"example: public-sector us army\" class=\"quotes-carousel__quote\"\u003e`\n\nUpdate \"Off-line Environment\" learn more link:\n\n* [x] `data-ga-name=\"offline environment\"`\n\nAdd attributes to \"Low to High Environment\":\n\n* [x] `data-ga-name=\"low to high\" data-ga-location=\"quotes carousel\"`\n\nAdd attributes to \"GitLab meets NIST SSDF 1.1 guidance\" and \"hardened\"\n\n* [x] `data-ga-name=\"gitlab meets nist\" data-ga-location=\"value prop\"`\n* [x] `data-ga-name=\"hardened\" data-ga-location=\"value prop\"`\n\n* [x] I noticed the \"All Case Studies\" link has an `\u003ca\u003e` tag nested inside another `\u003ca\u003e` tag. Not sure if this is a mistake, but Google Tag Manager will target the inner `\u003ca\u003e` tag, so the data-attributes will need to go on both `\u003ca\u003e` tags.\n\n* [x] Same as above for the case study learn more links. \n* [x] Also, need to update data-ga-name from \"learn more\" to include the customer's name, ie. \"us army cyber school learn more\".\n\nAdd data attributes to the \"View all resources\" link:\n\n* [x] `data-ga-name=\"view all resources\" data-ga-location=\"resource cards\"`","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-23T20:25:02.756Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T12:54:07.982Z","closed_at":"2022-04-26T00:17:56.449Z","closed_by":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"labels":["dex-status::doing"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"}],"author":{"id":10032575,"username":"mduque-ext","name":"Miguel Duque","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10032575/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mduque-ext"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/729","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":22,"completed_count":19},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/729","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/729/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/729/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#729","relative":"#729","full":"gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience#729"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":91,"epic":{"id":437217,"iid":91,"title":"SOLUTIONS: Content Neighbourhood","url":"/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/epics/91","group_id":13465353},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":106984639,"iid":714,"project_id":28847821,"title":"Missing Open Graph Tags","description":"Some Open Graph tags are missing from the URLs in the Buyer Experience repo.\n\nWith Open Graph, you get full control over how your posts look when they're shared on social media platforms like Facebook.
