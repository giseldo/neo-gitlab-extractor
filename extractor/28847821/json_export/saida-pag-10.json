Now we need to combine them. \n\n### Jobs To Be Done\n\n* **Situation**: *When a user goes through the sign up flow*\n* **Motivation**: *We want to track the GTM events for new group and project creation*\n* **Outcome**: *So we can measure the free trial*\n\n## Page(s)\n\nWhich page(s) are involved in this request?\n* `gitlab.com/users/sign_up/groups_projects/new`\n\n## DCI\n\n[DRI, Consulted, Informed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci)\n\n- [ ] DRI: @tywilliams \n- [ ] Consulted: @dennis106 @gdoud \n- [ ] Informed: @mpreuss22 \n\n## In scope\n\nWe're going to track this as a single event and use contextual info about free trial as suggested [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/361#note_845647533). \n\nSo the event should now be:\n\n```\ndataLayer.push({\n  'event': 'combinedGroupProjectFormSubmit',\n})\n```\n\nThe URL will have `trial_onboarding_flow=true` in it if the user is coming from a free trial onboarding experience, which we can use to differentiate for trials and regular sign up flows.\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?

We need to match your old URLs with the new ones or relevant alternatives. Without proper redirection, our new/consolidated pages will not get the traffic and PageRank of the old pages, which will affect our search engine rankings.\n\n## Redirecting best practices\n- To best preserve search rankings and traffic for better performing pages, it is best to keep the URL structure intact.\n- When removing, deprecating or consolidating URLs it is important to redirect to a relevant alternative to preserve the SEO value from backlinks \n- Update internal links from the old URLs to the new URLs to prevent internal redirects which impacts crawl budget. \n- Check for existing 301 redirects to URLs that will be removed, relocated or consolidated. Updating these to the new URLs will prevent redirect chains and loops which impacts crawl budget.\n\n## Risks\nCombining, changing URLs or deprecating pages comes with risks that will affect SEO efforts. If not properly managed we run the risk of:\n- Losing SEO value from backlinks attributed to removed or relocated URLs\n- Drop in search traffic and rankings. It might take some time for search engines to update their search index.\n- Increase in 404 errors, redirect chains and redirect loops.\n- Increase in soft 404s error messages in Google Search

Before the switch these were all internal. This can be amended but we need to ensure we preserve all internal links when migrating.\n\n### Heading Heirachy\nHeadings gives search engines important clues about the page structure and relevancy. headings should be logically structured, starting with a h1 followed by h2's, and subsequent h3's fir related subsections, etc. The current structure isn't in a logical order. Search engines utilse header structures to decipher the informational structure and topical hierarchy of a page.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `\u003ch2 class=\"copy__title\" data-v-b44de53e=\"\" data-v-34d03aa1=\"\"\u003eContinuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)\u003c/h2\u003e `. This should be **H1**.\n\n- `\u003ch3 class=\"header slp-text-xxl\" data-v-b44de53e=\"\" data-v-daaa09f2=\"\"\u003e What is CI/CD? \u003c/h3\u003e `. This should be **H2**.\n\n### FAQ schema\nThe FAQ schema.org markup is missing from the page. This was implemented to make search engine better understand page contents and display the pages in the form of Rich Snippets in SERPs.\n\n### Self referencing canonical path\nSelf referencing canonical path is missing from this page and other pages that have migrated. This is needed to prevent search engines from indexing URLs with tracking parameters. Search performance is not affected but tracking statistics will be skewed.

Removed pre-filled username from form field\n\nSuggestions that still need work:\n\n1. \"Just do it\" best practice [suggestions 1-6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/213):\n   1. [ ] **Autofocus on the first field**\n   1. [ ] **Use specialized mobile keyboards** - label textboxes: email (type=email), telephone numbers (type=tel), URLs (type=url), and numbers (type=num)\n   1. [ ] **In line validation** - show the error as soon as the user has left the field (rather than on submit), and the error should be specific\n   1. [ ] **Make labels clickable** - add the input element inside its respective label element\n   1. [ ] **Let users see their password** - less onerous than requiring them to type it twice and allows the user to see if typed correctly\n      * [Figma example](https://www.figma.com/file/NxDRjifeVhRIVPFrTzeQdg/Free-Trial-updates?node-id=44%3A6639)\n   1.

If we allow the user to see their password (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/213), don’t erase that either – they may want to check to see if they made a typo.\n1. \"Just do it\" best practice [suggestion 10](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/217)\n   * **Remember email on the “reset password\" page**\n1. \"Just do it\" best practice [suggestion 11](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/268)\n   * **Alternative suggested username** (without pre-filling the form field)\n\n## Out of scope\nWhat is out of scope and not part of this iteration?\n\n- Free trial product experience\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?
