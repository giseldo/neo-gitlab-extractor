Currently they link out to the live site.\n\nMichael is referring to the review app at [https://refresh.about.gitlab-review.app/](https://refresh.about.gitlab-review.app/). But more generally, this issue will happen to *any* review app, if we use absolute URLs.\n\nOur lives will be a lot easier for local development, review app feedback, and production deployments if we use relative paths across this website. \n\nAs an example, an absolute path is: `https://about.gitlab.com/enterprise/`. Whereas the relative path would be `/enterprise/`. \n\nThe advantage of using the relative path is that it keeps users on the same root domain as they navigate a particular deployment. It also ensure that we don't accidentally click links and go to different environments in development. \n\nThis is the same approach we should take for images (until we get a digital asset management tool, which will change the strategy). Images should refer to relative file paths, and should exist in our repository. \n\nI think the fix for this is for someone to go through and:\n\n1. Search the entire Buyer Experience repository for references to `https://about.gitlab.com`\n1. Convert the reference to be a relative link (where applicable - there may be some edge cases that really should always point to production, but I can't think of any off the top of my head)\n1. We should consider a linter that will check for this, although truthfully I think that's a hard problem to solve, because sometimes we really truly need to write an absolute path (again, I can't think of when, but we might), and I don't love having linters check every single text file for these kinds of strings. It will slow down our CI. Personally, I would prefer to catch this in code review where we can. But if someone has a better, automated proposal, I'm all ears.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-22T22:15:30.339Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T21:25:47.473Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T21:25:47.459Z","closed_by":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"labels":["dex-status::todo","dex::engineering"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":10032586,"username":"jariasc-ext","name":"John Arias Castillo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10032586/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jariasc-ext"}],"author":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":10032586,"username":"jariasc-ext","name":"John Arias Castillo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10032586/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jariasc-ext"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/569","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/569","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/569/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/569/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#569","relative":"#569","full":"gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience#569"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":105231826,"iid":567,"project_id":28847821,"title":"Update release post instructions to new homepage","description":"## Goal\nWe would like to X which will improve Y as measured by Z.\n\n### Jobs To Be Done\n* **Situation**: *When ...*\n* **Motivation**: *We want to ...*\n* **Outcome**: *So we can ...*\n\n## Page(s)\nWhich page(s) are involved in this request?\n* `[Page Title](URL)`\n\n## DCI\n[DRI, Consulted, Informed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci)\n\n- [ ] DRI: `GitLab Handle`\n- [ ] Consulted: `GitLab Handle`\n- [ ] Informed: `Everyone`\n\n## In scope\nWhat is within scope of this request?\n\n- [ ] Deliverable 1\n- [ ] Deliverable 2\n\n## Out of scope\nWhat is out of scope and not part of this iteration?\n\n- Not in scope 1\n- Not in scope 2\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?

a better solution for handling data in Nuxt pages","description":"## Goal\n\nWe'd like to manage the content in the Nuxt site in a more consistent, extensible, flexible way. \n\nThe pages this matters most for are in the upcoming work. `@mpreuss22` gave us the [rundown of our current commitment in Slack]():\n\nGoal is to deliver 10 amazing, newly designed pages with the rest of the site being on brand, live by April 27th:\n\nTier 01 (Doing 2nd): 3-4 page templates - Complete new vision, design, and content\n* Homepage\n* Pricing Page\n* Solutions / Features Pages\n* Install (stretch)\n\nTier 02 (Doing 3rd): 6-7 page templates - Well considered new design, significant new content, limited new branded/image/motion assets\n\n* Category Leadership (Currently called Topics)\n* Demo\n* Enterprise\n* SMB\n* DevOps Lifecycle Pages\n* Getting Started\n* Contact Sales\n\nTier 03 (Doing 1st): - New coat of paint: updated fonts, colours, logos\nEverything else: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ualGLPCyFjEpiskrfAe2ftqoTAw8t56lO1LMzMT7Ojo/edit\n\nSo to start, I'm going to look at the Tier 01 pages and do the following: \n\n1. See which, if any, we have represented in `content`\n1. Take a look at how their page level `.vue` files consume that data\n1. Identify common data structures, identify oddities and outliers (stuff that needs special handling)\n1. Write up a spec for how we should structure data to be consumed by pages\n1. Pitch that spec to @ndubord as a first iteration \n\nOnce I do that, I'll write up an interface and try it out on the Homepage. I'll put together more specific issues for each page as I go. \n\nI'm going to timebox this to about a day-and-a-half, and see how far I can get on it. Once I know more, I'll add additional points, add additional issues, etc.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-14T18:49:20.415Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T16:26:49.380Z","closed_at":"2022-03-16T16:26:49.364Z","closed_by":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"labels":["dex-status::doing"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"}],"author":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/550","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/550","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/550/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/550/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#550","relative":"#550","full":"gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience#550"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104790019,"iid":547,"project_id":28847821,"title":"Automate removal of unused assets from www-gitlab-com","description":"## Goal\nAs we remove pages from the www-gitlab-com, assets are becoming obsolete.
