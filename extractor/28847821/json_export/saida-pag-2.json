reoccurring artifact upload failures","description":"## Goal\nIn the last sprint, we have seen three separate incidents where the pipeline in www is failing because of the buyer-experience job. We have mitigated these incidents, but need to investigate a root cause. \n\n\n#### Details and Timeline\n\nThurs, Feb 2nd - [Incident-8354](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1870): Pipelines for the buyer-experience job started 503-ing, implying \"no access\" to the artifact. After declaring a [prod incident](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/8354), it was discovered that the buyer experience repository had been made private, meaning that the artifacts were being uploaded somewhere inaccessible. Changing the repo to public, and re-uploading a new artifact, seemed to fix the problem. \n\nFri, Feb 3rd - [Incident-8354 part 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1874): Same job in www starts failing, this time due to a 404 (file not found). After checking the difference between a recent successful \"pages\" deploy job in buyer experience, and comparing it to the most recent \"pages\" deploy job, we noticed that the runner was a private runner. We removed all private runners, and re-uploaded a new artifact. This seemed to fix the problem, and we assumed that the private runners were added to our repo when it had been made private yesterday. \n\nFri, Feb 10th - Same as last week, the artifact starts 404-ing. The repo is public, there are no private runners. Looking at the last \"pages\" deploy in buyer experience, it was the automatic changelog job. I created a new MR, merged it in order to create a new artifact, and went over and re-ran the failed jobs in buyer experience, which seemed to fix the problem. \n\n#### Theories\nSimply due to the fact that the changelog job had been run immediately prior to each of the 3 incidents, we may need to investigate how it may be affecting our CI. Especially since we're seeing these 404 failures on Friday's (the changelog script has [recently been changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/1642) to run every second Friday). My instinct is to let the job run on it's own in 2 weeks and see if we run into problems, or manually run the job and keep an eye on www pipelines. \n\n**If this is urgent, what is the business need for the urgency?**\n- [x]  Yes: This blocks all MRs from building \u0026 deploying in the handbook, blog, and some marketing web pages. \n- [ ]  No\n\n\n## DCI\n[DRI, Consulted, Informed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci)\n\n- [x] DRI: `@lduggan @ndubord`\n- [x] Consulted: `@laurenbarker @justin.vetter `\n- [ ] Informed: `Everyone`\n\n\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?

The server can then look up the user's session in the database(or API) to determine if they are logged in or not.\n\nThis solution was also suggested by a Staff Support Engineer in the `#g_manage_auth` slack channel\n\n#### How\n\n1. **Assign a unique session ID to each user when they log in**: When a user logs in, generate a unique session ID for them and store it in a cookie on their device.\n1. **Store the session ID in a shared database(or API):** Store the session ID in a database that can be accessed by both repositories. This allows us verify the user's login status by checking if their session ID is present in the database.\n1. **Verify the user's login status with each request**: On each request from the user's device, both repositories can check the session ID in the cookie against the session ID stored in the database. If the session IDs match, the user is considered to be logged in.\n1. **Update the cookie when the user logs out**: When the user logs out, you can delete their session ID from the database and remove the cookie from their device.\n\n#### Problems\n\n1. Potential scaling issues: performance issues may arise with a larger user base but this could be mitigated by sharding\n1. Latency\n1. Security? May need to flag that team for awareness and implementing some sort of encryption for the cookies\n1. Maintenance? May need to onboard more people in GDK to maintain this\n1. Cookies are client-side so the user maybe clear the cookies at any point.
