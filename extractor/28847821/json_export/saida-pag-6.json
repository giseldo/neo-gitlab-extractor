GDN - POC - Discovery","description":"### Background\nWe've contracted the GDN with Smartling since the contract began, but we haven't used it. This issue is to track a Proof of Concept for the Smartling GDN prior to contracting it this year.\n\nNote the DRI of the POC will be the Digital Experience team (this issue can be moved if necessary). \n\n### Proof of Concept Options\n1) Full Deployment - This includes a full deployment of the Smartling GDN and will require Smartling Professional Services to implement. Professional Services hours for this type of POC ranges from 25-30 hours, estimated cost is $5,000-$8,000. The reason for the cost is that we would be able to continue to use the GDN once it is set-up and we add it to the contract.\n1) Partial Deployment - We would select a few pages (number TBD) and Smartling would connect these to show us how it works. If it is only a few pages, there wouldn't be a cost to this.\n1) In depth technical demo - This would be a 90 minute call with Smartling where they would show us (on their site), a step-by-step demo of how the GDN works. This would not be on our site.\n\n### Comments from Smartling\n- Prior to any POC, Smartling requested that we define what a successful POC looks like.\n- Our next steps on the website evaluation will be to arrange a technical demo of the GDN on the GitLab website highlighting any specific use cases or actions the team would like to validate.\n- Similarly, we can schedule a discussion of the pros and cons to use our Repository Connector Vs the GDN to support the website translation initiative both are great options, the deciding factors will be based on your overall strategy/objectives of the website translations project and the team's desired experience/LOE.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Determine what we would like to get out of the POC? What questions are we trying to answer / what does success look like?\n- Determine which POC option we are most interested in based on the POC goals.\n- Technical discussion with Smartling related to using the GDN or the Code Repo for website translation.\n\n\n### Requests from Smartling\nSmartling asked that we answer these questions prior to our GDN discussion.\n\n1- What is the business objective surrounding translations? (Ex: Drive more leads to the website, convert more leads on the website, support an existing international sales team to convert more deals, etc)\n * Answer: Drive more leads, support an existing sales team to convert more deals\n\n2- What success metric will you be tracking against as it relates to translation (Website metrics (traffic, conversion rates, page views, bounce rate, etc), sales team conversation success, new user adoption, decrease in support tickets, etc)\n * Answer: Website metrics, new INQ, trials\n \n3- Please list in the order of priority the content you are looking to translate. (Specific websites, Landing Pages, Blogs, Web application)\n * Answer: Ultimately, we will translate about.gitlab.com and all navigation pages. To start with the POC, we will translate the [Homepage](about.gitlab.com), [Why Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/why-gitlab/), [Pricing Page] (https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)\n\n4- What Technology do you use to create and/or serve this content? (CMS, Marketing Automation, E-Comm Platform, Other?)\n * **Need answer**\n\n5.1- What source language is your content in?\n * Answer: English\n\n5.2- Which language(s) are you translating into?\n * Answer: Japanese, French, German\n\n6- What are your annual translation volumes? (best guess of plan is fine)\n * Answer: Currently around 160k processed words for marketing, but this is expected to increase. Web hasn't been started yet.\n\n7- Stakeholders\na. Who needs to be involved in the evaluation?  Answer: Digital Experience team, Marketing Ops, others TBD\nb. Who will be using the tool?  Answer: Digital Experience team (technical GDN), project management DRI TBD\nc. Who will be vetting the technology and integration path? Answer: Digital Experience team\nd. Who is the budget holder for sign-off? Answer: Marketing Operations\n\n8- Describe your ideal translation process.\n * **Answer: Need answer**\n\n9- Describe the challenges you are facing in the current process.\n * Answer: No solution for web translations currently in place.\n\n10- What do you need to see in our solution to move forward with Smartling? \n * **Answer: Need answer, what does success look like**\n\n\n@RLeihe268 @mpreuss22 @davidbrown1 @justin.vetter @laurenbarker \n\n\n\u003c!-- Please leave the label below on this issue --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-19T22:43:16.215Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T17:37:19.122Z","closed_at":"2022-09-12T15:43:03.084Z","closed_by":{"id":7823881,"username":"lduggan","name":"Laura Duggan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7823881/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lduggan"},"labels":["MktgOps::04: In Progress","dex-group::search-nav-support","dex-okr::Q3","dex-priority::1","dex-status::doing"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3955006,"username":"jennyt","name":"Jenny Tiemann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3955006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jennyt"},{"id":7823881,"username":"lduggan","name":"Laura Duggan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7823881/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lduggan"}],"author":{"id":3955006,"username":"jennyt","name":"Jenny Tiemann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3955006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jennyt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3955006,"username":"jennyt","name":"Jenny Tiemann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3955006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jennyt"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1277","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/1277","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/1277/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821/issues/1277/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/28847821","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1277","relative":"#1277","full":"gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience#1277"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":160,"epic":{"id":599766,"iid":160,"title":"Smartling GDN - POC","url":"/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/epics/160","group_id":13465353},"iteration":{"id":66135,"iid":25,"sequence":10,"group_id":13465353,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-06-24T00:05:02.925Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T00:05:01.946Z","start_date":"2022-09-12","due_date":"2022-09-25","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/iterations/66135"},"health_status":null},{"id":113421946,"iid":1257,"project_id":28847821,"title":"ENG: Why Premium/Ultimate | Update \u003ctitle\u003e and H1","description":"## Goal\nWe would like to add the GitLab name into the page title to help with organic search\n\n\u003ctitle\u003eWhy GitLab Premium?\u003c/title\u003e\n\u003ctitle\u003eWhy GitLab Ultimate?\u003c/title\u003e\n\n### Jobs To Be Done\n* **Situation**: *When a user searches GitLab tiers adding our name into the results helps brand*\n* **Motivation**: *We want to ...*\n* **Outcome**: *So we can increase organic search traffic*\n\n## Page(s)\nWhich page(s) are involved in this request?\n* https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/premium/\n* https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ultimate/\n\n## DCI\n[DRI, Consulted, Informed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci)\n\n- [ ] DRI: `GitLab Handle`\n- [ ] Consulted: @justin.vetter @jhalloran @fqureshi `@ncregan` \n- [ ] Informed: `Everyone`\n\n## In scope\nWhat is within scope of this request?\n\n- [ ] Update Title of the two pages\n- [ ] Deliverable 2\n\n## Out of scope\nWhat is out of scope and not part of this iteration?\n\n- Not in scope 1\n- Not in scope 2\n\n## Requirements\nWhat are the requirements for this request?

This year, there are efforts being made to migrate the handbook out of the www-gitlab-com repository and into it's own. Since the features.yml file feeds content to both the handbook and buyer experience pages, we need to come up with an automated solution. While coming up with the solution we should also rethink the data structure, and how we can best serve the people using it (product). How can we make the product teams life easier while satisfying the needs of handbook and buyer experience.\n\n# Usage\nLast 20 updates to features.yml\n- 18 unique contributors\n    - 12 from
