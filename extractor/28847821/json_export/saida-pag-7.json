MR Type labels help us report what we're working on to leadership in a way that's consistent across the engineering department.\n\nThis issue is for aligning with the Digital Experience team on these items: \n\n1. Introduce merge request types for the Digital Experience team to align with the [Cross Functional Prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/cross-functional-prioritization.html) process of product groups. We have some merge request types being implement as part of the approval process being worked on [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/epics/135). Should we add additional types for bugs, maintenance, and features? \n1. Create a dashboard for MR by Type for Digital Experience. Dashboards listing MR by Type were created and added to every group for product as part of [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13294). Here is the [Merge Request Types Detail periscope dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/976854/Merge-Request-Types-Detail) for product. \n1.
