We will ask them for clarifications, decisions, facilitation, or other assistance.\n* A stakeholder is a person who represents an entity that the project impacts. We might ask about their needs, request their feedback, or inform them when the project is complete.\n* Subject matter experts (SME) will be asked questions related to their expertise. Example subjects include design, development, copy, analytics, seo, social, ops, handbook, infrastructure, technologies like Marketo, etc.\n* You may insert or remove as many lines as needed to list the relevant people involved with the project and their roles.\n\n|Name|Role|\n|------|------|\n| @mpreuss22  | DRI |\n| @vsilverthorne   | Content SME|\n| `@user2` | UX design |\n| `@user3` | Development |\n| @bmatturro  | Content stakeholder|\n| @dmor  | Stakeholder|\n\n\n#### What is the timeframe AND WHY?\nDates without reason are difficult to prioritize. Without enough lead time we will be unable to meet your deadline. Example: Our due date is XXXX-XX-XX. We want to launch this page before a trade show happens on YYYY-YY-YY. We need a week to coordinate press before the event.\n\n*If your ask requires multiple delivery deadlines, consider creating an epic with an issue for each deadline.*\n\nAlign with Navigation updates if the footer is included, if not let's aim for mid February\n\n## Project Deliverables\n\n* [ ] Add newsletter sign-up form to global footer\n\n## Related Documents/Information\nLink and explain all related documents, websites, assets, logos etc. NOTE: The web team will not be able to meet deadlines unless everything is provided.
