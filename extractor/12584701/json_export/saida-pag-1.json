set, for example: \n\n```\nconfigurations:\n    backups:\n    - compression: lz4\n      cronSchedule: 30 01 * * 6\n      path: sgbackups.stackgres.io/my-db/my-db/13\n```\n\n- Create a Major version Upgrade SGDbOps without filling the backup path field (from the UI)\n- The major version upgrade finished but the cluster will not start because of the value of the backup path\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nThe Cluster is upgraded successfully and the sgbackups path is set with a new valid value.  \n\n### Possible Solution\n\nIn the case to solve the issue I follow the next steps:\n\n1. Delete the StackGres validation webhook (I did a backup first)\n2. Edit the SGCluster and set the new value for the backup path\n3. Re-create the validation webhook\n4. Delete the sgcluster pod\n5. wait for the cluster to start. \n\nIt would be nice to have a warning message or error if you do not specify a correct value and prevent the SGDbOps to be created. \n\n\n### Environment\n\n- StackGres version: 1.4.0\n\u003c!-- if you have used helm, you can use:  `helm get notes -n stackgres stackgres-operator` \nmore generic: `kubectl get deployments -n stackgres stackgres-operator --template '{{ printf \"%s\\n\" (index .spec.template.spec.containers 0).image }}'`\n--\u003e\n- Kubernetes version: 1.23.14\n\u003c!--(use `kubectl version`) --\u003e\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: DigitalOcean\n\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- (Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

Summary\n\nAs stated [on the SG docs](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/reference/crd/sgcluster/#restore-from-backup):\n\n\u003e It is possible to restore the database to its state at any time since your backup was taken using Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) **as long as another backup newer than the PITR requested restoration date does not exists.**\n\nYet the web console allows for users to set PITR specs even if one or several backups have been taken after the backup chosen for the initialization.\n\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Enter the web console\n\n- **Create Base Backups:**\n  - Create backup `X` for any cluster\n  - Wait for backup `X` to be completed\n  - Crate backup `Y` for the same cluster\n  - Wait for backup `Y` to be completed\n \n- Enter the \"Create Cluster\" form:\n  - Enable Advanced Options\n  - Click on the \"Initialization\" step\n  - Select backup `X` from the dropdown\n\n- PITR inputs will appear, even though backup `Y` exists and it has been taken after backup `X`\n\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nPITR inputs can only be shown if no backups have been taken after the one chosen for cluster initialization\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- StackGres version:

Currently the only workaround is to follow the procedure to [\"Reconvery PGDATA from existing volume\"](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/runbooks/recover-pgdata-from-existing-volume/) documented in a StackGres runbook.\n\n### Further details\n\nWhen a major version upgrade operation fails, if the user did not used the link or clone options the old data is not lost but is still present in the Persistent Volume. The problem is that the cluster can not be used due to the following reasons:\n\n* The `.status.dbOps.majorVersionUpgrade` section is used by the operator to know that the major-version-upgrade init container has to be created. The container blocks the cluster from starting\n* The `.spec.postgres.version` can not be changed directly by the user but have to be modified by the SGDbOps generated serviceaccount.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMake the SGDbOps major version upgrade operation to automatically rollback the operation in case of failure is the clone or link options are not used or only the check has been executed.\n\n## Testing\n\nImprove major version upgrade test in order to check the rollback is performed if the operation fails\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n* [ ] Implementation\n* [ ] Test\n* [ ] Documentation\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-29T15:21:04.197Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T11:14:57.019Z","closed_at":"2022-09-19T08:57:38.780Z","closed_by":{"id":2577634,"username":"teoincontatto","name":"Matteo Melli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2577634/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teoincontatto"},"labels":["Feature Request","StackGres","target_version::1.4.0-beta1","team::DEV","workflow::In Review"],"milestone":{"id":2734475,"iid":20,"group_id":3102997,"title":"StackGres 1.4.0-beta1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-12T08:58:43.213Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T18:20:42.056Z","due_date":"2022-10-10","start_date":"2022-08-22","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/ongresinc/-/milestones/20"},"assignees":[{"id":2577634,"username":"teoincontatto","name":"Matteo Melli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2577634/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teoincontatto"}],"author":{"id":2577634,"username":"teoincontatto","name":"Matteo Melli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2577634/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teoincontatto"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2577634,"username":"teoincontatto","name":"Matteo Melli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2577634/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teoincontatto"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1983","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12584701/issues/1983","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12584701/issues/1983/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12584701/issues/1983/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12584701","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1983","relative":"#1983","full":"ongresinc/stackgres#1983"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":114013409,"iid":1981,"project_id":12584701,"title":"PITR date and time picker not working in the Web console","description":"\n### Summary\n\nTrying to restore a backup using PITR from the Web console, the date picker is not working, after the automatic refresh the date selected is cleaned.\n\n![image](/uploads/faec6768713c5006ab2b1bc62e4b029b/image.png)\n\nAlso, the date range used to initialize the datepicker is wrong. \n\nTo set the final date on the range, the initialisation process uses the backup immediately next to the chosen one, even though the SGBackups list coming from the API is ordered alphabetically rather than by date.\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

- Add loadBalancerIP to SGCluster and SGDistributedLogs","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently, it is not possible to specify a custom load balancer IP for the Postgres services, the idea of this is to be able to set a custom load balancer IP for R/W and R/O connections, this also allows to keep the same IP in case if it's necessary to recreate the services.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn the SGCluster services section allows to add a custom load balancer IP (SGCluster and DistributedLogs)\n\n```yaml\npostgresServices:\n    primary:\n      type: LoadBalancer\n      loadBalancerIP: 80.11.12.10\n    replicas:\n      type: LoadBalancer\n      loadBalancerIP: 80.11.12.11\n```\n\nAnd generate a service like: \n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: StackGresCluster\n    cluster-name: my-cluster\n    role: master\n  ports:\n    - name: pgport\n      protocol: TCP\n      port: 5432\n      targetPort: pgport\n  loadBalancerIP: 80.11.12.10\n```\n\n### Links / references\n\n**Acceptance criteria:**\n- [ ] Implement the change on the WebUI - SGCluster\n- [ ] Implement the change on the WebUI - DistributedLogs\n- [ ] Create tests","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-28T11:32:56.201Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T11:10:47.154Z","closed_at":"2023-01-23T16:55:46.902Z","closed_by":{"id":3344912,"username":"osaletsk","name":"Olesya
