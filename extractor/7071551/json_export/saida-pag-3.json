This will be especially useful as we work towards upgrading to Vue 3, as we'll want to make sure that our libraries are compatible with Vue's new APIs.\n\nNote that as of writing this, BootstapVue is not yet compatible with Vue 3: https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/5196\n\nSince we're currently several versions behind the latest BootstrapVue, we will proceed by upgrading to each minor version individually so that we can better evaluate the impacts and fix what needs to be fixed.\n\n| Version                                                             | MR

`4.4.1`\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n### v4.4.1\n\n- Fix Dart Sass compatibility\n- Add :disabled for disabled fieldset\n\n### v4.4.0\n\nHighlights\nHere's what you need to know about v4.4.0. Remember that with every minor and major release of Bootstrap, we ship a new URL for our hosted docs to ensure URLs continue to work.- New responsive containers! Over a year in the making, fluid up to a particular breakpoint, available for all responsive tiers.\n\n- New responsive .row-cols classes for quickly specifying the number of columns across breakpoints. This one is huge for those of you who have asked for responsive card decks.\n- New escape-svg() function for simplifying our embedded background-image SVGs for forms and more.\n- New add() and subtract() functions for avoiding errors and zero values from CSS's built in calc feature.\n- New make-col-auto() mixin to make our .col-auto class available with custom HTML.\n- Fixed an issue with Microsoft Edge not picking up :disabled styles by moving selectors to [disabled].\n- Deprecated: bg-variant(), nav-divider(), and form-control-focus() mixins are now deprecated as they're going away in v5.\n- Updated our spacing and alignment for modal footer elements like buttons to automatically wrap when space is constrained.\n- More flexible form control validation styles thanks to fewer chained selectors. Also updated the :invalid validation icon to be an alert instead of an \u0026times; to avoid confusion with browser functionality for clearing the form field value.\n- Fixed a couple dozen CSS and JS bugs.\n- Moved to GitHub Actions for CI/CD! Expect more updates to our CI setup over time here while Actions evolves.\n- Updated documentation to fix links and typos, improved landmarks for secondary navigation, and a new security doc for guidelines on reporting potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n# Key takeaways\n\nLooking at BootsrapVue's and Bootstrap's changelogs, here a few key takeaways that we might want to consider.\n\nUpgrading to BootstrapVue `2.13.0` brings in a few new components and directives, most notably:\n\n- [`\u003cb-form-datepicker\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/form-datepicker)\n- [`\u003cb-calendar\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/calendar)\n- [`\u003cb-sidebar\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/sidebar)\n- [`\u003cb-aspect\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/aspect)\n- [`\u003cb-form-spinbutton\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/form-spinbutton)\n- [`\u003cb-time\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/time)\n- [`\u003cb-form-tags\u003e`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/form-tags)\n- [`v-b-visible`](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/directives/visible)\n\nBootstrap itself comes with some style updates, some of which seem to impact our components visually:\n\n- Modals' footer spacing has been adjusted, resulting in slight visual diff in `GlModal`:\n\n![storyshots-spec-js-image-storyshots-base-modal-opened-modal-1-diff](/uploads/47200cf4d2501eae297451019d0e7780/storyshots-spec-js-image-storyshots-base-modal-opened-modal-1-diff.png)\n\nModals are widely used in GitLab's projects, but this impact seems acceptable considering that `GlModal` doesn't comply with Pajamas specifications at the moment. Let's smoke test a few modals in GitLab anyway, to make sure there aren't unexpected effect to this change.\n\n\n- [Flush list groups](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/list-group/#flush) now remove the top border from the first list item, which impacts `GlPaginatedList`:\n\n![storyshots-spec-js-image-storyshots-base-paginated-list-default-1-diff](/uploads/a406894af3b047e280586e3016769940/storyshots-spec-js-image-storyshots-base-paginated-list-default-1-diff.png)\n\nThis has a very low impact on GitLab as `GlPaginatedList` is only used in the **License Compliance** app:\n\n| **Before** | **After** |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/97010196daa37cf7f97bfe38baf6180f/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/a8ac7a3b6ed956f196805d8d453594e5/image.png) |\n\n\nOverall, there doesn't seem to be any negative impact.\n\n/cc

GlIntersectionObserver performance","description":"## Description\n\nThe [`GlIntersectionObserver`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/blob/314dda4b7e37ba103daaa797c37a718d504a5b3c/src/components/utilities/intersection_observer/intersection_observer.vue#L1) creates an [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) for every instance. When implementing the [`GlResizeObserver`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/blob/225bf66a8818cbf7f74ae1339b8f19b856f25352/src/directives/resize_observer/resize_observer.js#L6) we learned that these observers are [meant to be shared](https://github.com/WICG/ResizeObserver/issues/59). This is because there's a bottleneck with passing messages from the native environment to the JavaScript environment.\n\n## Demo\n\nHere's a patch that creates a 100x10 table filled with `gl-intersection-observers` which each update with the [`intersectionRatio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/intersectionRatio) of the triggered event.\n\n[0001-wip-big-table-example.patch](/uploads/287d49589b28d2182f76f6fc1298341f/0001-wip-big-table-example.patch)\n\n| Observers created for every instance (on `master`) | Observers shared (this proposal) |\n|---------|----------|\n| ![20200311_lots_of_intersection_observers_slow](/uploads/8fae9d5c39c6db4d1eabd1afd4c05b1f/20200311_lots_of_intersection_observers_slow.mp4) | ![20200311_shared_intersection_observer](/uploads/a530a94a856ba91e2e5f9e99cbd5380b/20200311_shared_intersection_observer.mp4) |\n\n- Notice that the first example the numbers take a long time to update. This is because there's a huge lag for triggering every \"IntersectionObservable\" callback.\n- *side note:* I'm not sure where the decimals come from, but I think this has to do with the experimental nature of IntersectionObserver :shrug:\n- Here's a dummy WIP patch used for the \"Observers shared\" example: [0002-wip-shared-intersection-observer.patch](/uploads/a4e94b9cce363c0a1b8f9660f46e98ab/0002-wip-shared-intersection-observer.patch)\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nI suggest following the implementation of [`ResizeObserver`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/blob/225bf66a8818cbf7f74ae1339b8f19b856f25352/src/directives/resize_observer/resize_observer.js#L6) as an example for this behavior: \n\n- Let's just create one intersection observable for now (later we can figure out what to do if we want some more explicit options)\n- Let's move this to a directive (this way we don't create unnecessary `\u003cdiv\u003e`s)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-13T01:10:18.404Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:31:50.077Z","closed_at":"2021-11-30T18:31:50.061Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["bug::performance","frontend"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

However, using pixels doesn't allow elements and spacing to scale correctly if the user adjusts their browser zoom level (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/merge_requests/684#note_201375954)\n\nUse rems for everything instead of pixels fixes this.\n\nThe `8px` spacing system from Pajamas uses pixels instead of rems because it's easier for everyone to understand the concept that way, and also because UI design software uses pixels. It would be harder to explain it if we said “We use 0.5rem as the base for determining our spacial system.” as this doesn't mean anything if we don't know the root size, so we would need to add “The root size is 16px”.\n\nWhen translating designs to the browser, the expectation is that 16px in the design translates to 16px **rendered** in the browser, but that doesn't mean we can't use rems to specify it. So the current spacing utility classes implementation took a literal approach to the `8px` spacing system.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-09T11:33:48.722Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T17:12:21.105Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T13:59:35.783Z","closed_by":{"id":408677,"username":"ClemMakesApps","name":"Clement Ho","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/013b4af8b474654bce8039ecd262a84a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ClemMakesApps"},"labels":["Pajamas","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backstage [DEPRECATED]","component styling","frontend","gitlab-ui-wg"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"}],"author":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/398","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/398","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/398/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/398/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#398","relative":"#398","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-ui#398"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23584330,"iid":394,"project_id":7071551,"title":"Replace bootstrap overrides in the breadcrumb component","description":"### Problem\n\nThe breadcrumb component was added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/merge_requests/387 but this also added some style overrides which affected existing components in the product like the breadcrumb for the repository path.
