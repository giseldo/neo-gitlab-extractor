Let's add out-of-the-box support for a close button in `GlPopover`.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n- [x] The close button should be a `small` button using the `close` icon. The GitLab implementation relies on a `\u003cspan class=\"gl-display-inline-block\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u0026times;\u003c/span\u003e` to render the `X`, which doesn't align with the design specs.\n- [x] Re-adjust the spacing to account for the change above.\n- [x] The close button's visibility should be controlled by a prop (eg. `has-close-button`).\n- [ ] Once the close button is implemented, remove all custom code from `ee/app/assets/javascripts/contextual_sidebar/components/trial_status_popover.vue` in favor of using the built-in feature.\n\ncc @dreedy

[▶︎ Screen reader demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12K20wzxrMuMrAq4T4HNXC_MiDXhE8NlO/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Background\n\nA dropdown can actually mean many things, from a select element in a form to navigation or a menu of functions. As it's defined in [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown#usage), it indeed is used for several different things:\n\n- Opening a list of navigation items.\n- Opening a menu of actions.\n- Opening a listbox or combobox.\n\nThe current implementation of a [dropdown](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-dropdown--default) in GitLab UI is specific to only one of these use cases, a menu. And the menu itself comes with many caveats and has implications for assistive technology (covered under definitions below). Additionally, I believe that the audit uncovered problems with the semantic structure of the current implementation. More details are in the audit recordings, but as a quick summary the unordered list semantics don't include a list item as the first child, and additionally `role=\"menu\"` requires some fairly strict semantics that I don't believe are 100% correct. \n\n### Definitions\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eMenu\u003c/summary\u003e\nA menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions. A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button, choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in Windows, that opens a context specific menu. When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu. ([source](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menu))\n\nAn item with `role=\"menu\"` places a screen reader in application mode, which then uses keyboarding different from regular web browsing and navigation. For this reason it isn't suitable for navigation where tabbing typically moves from one link to the next.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eDisclosure widget\u003c/summary\u003e\nA disclosure is a button that controls visibility of a section of content. When the controlled content is hidden, it is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content. When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down. ([source](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#disclosure))\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eMenu button\u003c/summary\u003e\nA menu button is a button that opens a menu. It is often styled as a typical push button with a downward pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display a menu. ([source](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton))\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eCombobox\u003c/summary\u003e\nA combobox is a widget made up of the combination of two distinct elements: 1) a single-line textbox, and 2) an associated pop-up element for helping users set the value of the textbox. The popup may be a listbox, grid, tree, or dialog. Many implementations also include a third optional element -- a graphical button adjacent to the textbox, indicating the availability of the popup. Activating the button displays the popup if suggestions are available. (https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#combobox)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eListbox\u003c/summary\u003e\nA listbox widget presents a list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them. A listbox that allows a single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a multi-select listbox. ([source](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#Listbox))\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Proposal\n\nAs-is, a single format for a dropdown will not satisfy the different use cases.

This causes the animation to never be triggered. \n\n### Solution\n\nWe can refactor our implementations of `GlSingleStat` from using `v-if` to `v-show`. This will ensure that the component only mounts once and each subsequent update triggers a prop update instead of a component remount. \n\n### Steps\n\n- Inspect each instance of `GlSingleStat`\n- Where updates to data can occur, i.e. filters available etc, replace `v-if` with `v-show`\n- Update tests as these will break on `exists`\n\n#### Notes\n\nThere are 6 instances of `GlSingleStat` looks like 3 or 4 instances are subject to data changes requiring animation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-13T09:17:10.691Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:55:11.637Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T09:28:43.501Z","closed_by":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon

vue/no-deprecated-slot-attribute violation(s) in src/components/charts/tooltip/tooltip.vue","description":"The file [`src/components/charts/tooltip/tooltip.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/tree/adea5ac1e4513c72153a773621cc495a9bf219cb/src/components/charts/tooltip/tooltip.vue) violates the [recently](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2269) enabled [`vue/no-deprecated-slot-attribute` rule](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/no-deprecated-slot-attribute.html#vue-no-deprecated-slot-attribute).\n\nMigrating to the newer slot syntax is a requirement for us to be able to adopt Vue 3.\n\n## What to do\n\nIn broad strokes, migrating this component will involve:\n\n1. Updating the template to use the newer slot syntax\n1. Fixing tests and/or adding tests in GitLab UI\n1. Creating an integration MR with GitLab, and fixing _its_ tests\n\n### Updating the template\n\nThis is the easy part! It's usually as simple as one of these example diffs:\n\n```diff\n-  \u003ctemplate slot=\"first\"\u003e\n+  \u003ctemplate #first\u003e\n```\n\n```diff\n-  \u003cdiv slot=\"foo\"\u003eSlot content\u003c/div\u003e\n+  \u003ctemplate #foo\u003e\n+    \u003cdiv\u003eSlot content\u003c/div\u003e\n+  \u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\n```diff\n-  \u003cslot slot=\"foo\" name=\"foo\"\u003eSlot default content\u003c/slot\u003e\n+  \u003ctemplate #foo\u003e\n+    \u003cslot name=\"foo\"\u003eSlot default content\u003c/slot\u003e\n+  \u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\n```diff\n-  \u003cslot v-for=\"slot in Object.keys($slots)\" :slot=\"slot\" :name=\"slot\"\u003e\u003c/slot\u003e\n+  \u003ctemplate v-for=\"slot in Object.keys($slots)\" #[slot]\u003e\n+    \u003cslot :name=\"slot\"\u003e\u003c/slot\u003e\n+  \u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\n```diff\n-  \u003cslot v-for=\"slot in Object.keys($scopedSlots)\" :slot=\"slot\" :name=\"slot\" slot-scope=\"scope\"\u003e\u003c/slot\u003e\n+  \u003ctemplate v-for=\"slot in Object.keys($scopedSlots)\" #[slot]=\"scope\"\u003e\n+    \u003cslot :name=\"slot\" v-bind=\"scope\"\u003e\u003c/slot\u003e\n+  \u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nSome components will require more work if they have conditional slot rendering.\n\n### Fixing GitLab UI tests\n\n1. If there are no failing tests, verify that the slot content is actually being tested somehow, and write a new test covering this if not.\n1. If there are failing tests, fix them!\n\n### Creating an integration MR with GitLab\n\n1. Once your MR for GitLab UI is in good shape, create an [integration MR against GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/main/doc/contributing/gitlab_integration_test.md#using-the-remote-development-package) using the `create_integration_branch` manual CI job.\n1.

from \"feat(echarts): update to echarts@5\"","description":"The following discussion from !2185 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @leipert started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2185#note_565928329):  (+5 comments)\n\n    \u003e Seems like there is a significant diff on the timelines...\n\n## What's this issue about\n\nCurrently the only chart component that sets the options related to a chart's zoom-bar in accordance with the [design specs](https://www.figma.com/file/17NxNEMa7i28Is8sMetO2H/Data-Visualization?node-id=63%3A697) is `GlLineChart`.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2185 removes the option that controls this will be removed from the line-chart component.\n\nIn order to keep the existing functionality aligned to the design-specs and increase overall consistency, this MR moves the zoom-bar options into the globally shared chart's theme.\n\n### Components affected\n\n* `GlAreaChart`\n* `GlBarChart`\n* `GlColumnChart`\n* `GlDiscreteScatterChart`\n* `GlLineChart`\n* `GlStackedColumnChart`\n\n| current implementation | design |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|

https://www.figma.com/file/17NxNEMa7i28Is8sMetO2H/Data-Visualization?node-id=63%3A697\n\n## Steps to reach this chart\n\n1. `yarn storybook` to start a local development server\n2. Open the browser \n3. On the left navigation menu, find **Charts** \u003e **Line Chart** \u003e **With zoom and scroll** (or simply visit `?path=/story/charts-line-chart--with-zoom-and-scroll`)\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1. `src/utils/charts/theme.js` seems to contain a `dataZoom` property. My initial guess is that this property can be used to define a background color for the highlight.

There is a huge upside in depending on `GlAvatar` to handle the `identicon` fallback as it really cleans up the template.  However, until we clean up the old usages of `identicon` we want to be sure to keep these color patterns inline as they help users identify their projects/groups at a glance.\n\ncc/
