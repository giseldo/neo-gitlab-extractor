Start with utility classes.\n2. If composing utility classes into a component class removes code duplication and encapsulates a clear responsibility, do it. \n\n**Why?**\n\n- \"utility-first\" encourages the organic growth of component classes.\n- It prevents the creation of one off not reusable classes.\n- It keeps component classes cohesive, since they can be combined with other utility classes.\n- It also encourages the creation of design-centered classes (e.g. button, alert, input), rather than domain-centered classes (e.g. security-report-widget, commit-header-icon).\n\n**Inspiration:**\n\n- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components/)\n\n## Description\n\nThroughout all Frontend projects, it is unclear when to prefer utility classes vs. component classes. Let's formalize our preference and add it to our FE documentation.\n\n**What are utility classes?**\n\n`.d-flex.prepend-top-default.append-bottom-default`\n\n[Bootstrap4 introduced many utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/) that each apply a single CSS rule. We've also adopted this pattern and created some custom utility classes. These are helpful for quickly overriding styles that are highly specific. \n\n**What are component classes?**\n\n`.component-header`\n\nThis is the common practice of creating CSS classes that encapsulate a logical set of rules.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What are our goals?**\n\n- Increase maintainability\n- Reduce CSS bloat \n\n**Advantages of utility classes:**\n\n- Prevents the need for one-off CSS classes that are never reused\n\n**Disadvantages of utility classes:**\n\n- Harder to read\n- Harder to edit in the browser inspector\n- The set of utility classes applied to an element is not reusable (although the Vue component itself is reusable)\n\n**Advantages of component classes:**\n\n- Easier to read\n- Easier to edit in the browser inspector\n- Reusable\n- Semantically describes the HTML element\n\n**Disadvantages of component classes:**\n\n- When reused in the wrong place, it can cause coupling of unrelated elements, hurting modifiability.\n- Naming of these classes can easily be inconsistent and unintuitive (e.g. wrapper, container, content, etc.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is nothing keeping us from doing both, but using either inappropriately leads to a brittle style sheet. `utility-first` is a pragmatic way to ensure we are creating the right kind of component classes.\n\n## Related Resources\n\n- https://davidtheclark.com/on-utility-classes/\n- https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-04T19:16:14.202Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T12:17:59.669Z","closed_at":"2019-05-23T19:51:21.393Z","closed_by":{"id":408677,"username":"ClemMakesApps","name":"Clement Ho","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/013b4af8b474654bce8039ecd262a84a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ClemMakesApps"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":655280,"iid":28,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.11","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-21T19:08:37.027Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T14:39:00.009Z","due_date":"2019-05-22","start_date":"2019-04-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/28"},"assignees":[{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"}],"author":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/38","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/38","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/38/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/38/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#38","relative":"#38","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-ui#38"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13436092,"iid":28,"project_id":7071551,"title":"Document contribution steps on how to create wrapped components","description":"Document contribution steps on how to create wrapped components\n\n## Steps\n1. Select a component\n1. Determine the scenarios (different types of implementations) in which this component is used in gitlab-ce/ee\n1. Document those scenarios in an issue\n1. Select a scenario that is implemented in gitlab-ce/ee that you will replace with your component\n1. Create a MR to [gitlab-ui](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/) implementing your new component\n   1. Be sure to name your MR `feat: \u003ccommit message\u003e` as that is needed for our npm release CI job\n   1. Create `component.vue` in `components/` directory\n   1. Create a story `component.js` in `stories/` directory\n   1. Run `yarn test --updateSnapshot` to generate your image snapshots for diffing\n1. Create a MR to gitlab-ce/ee to replace the scenario implementation that you previously selected\n   1. Update your `package.json` dependency reference of `@gitlab-org/gitlab-ui` to the URL output of the `upload_artifacts` ci job in your gitlab-ui MR\n   1. Run `yarn install` to make sure that the `gitlab-ui` contents are installed\n   1. Add a new component import to `app/assets/javascripts/commons/gitlab_ui.js` so that your component is globally registered\n1. Once you've verified that your integration MR to gitlab-ce/ee is working, assign a maintainer to review both gitlab-ui and gitlab-ce/ee MRs\n1. Maintainer will merge the gitlab-ui MR, run the manual CI job on `master` to make a new release onto NPM\n1. (You or maintainer) will update your integration MR `package.json` dependency reference to the newly released `gitlab-ui` version\n1. Maintainer will merge the integration MR\n\n## Methods to streamline steps\n1. Create CLI (eg. yeoman) to create templates for gitlab-ui MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/issues/14\n   1. Auto generate `component.vue` in components directory\n   1. Auto generate `component.js` in stories directory\n1. Create system for checking commit messages and MR titles so that they fit the semantic release
