This means that it should prevent `javascript://` links.\n\n* should allow URLs only with the following protocols (http, https, ftp, mailto)\n* should take care of encoded URIs\n* should render as `span` tag when the `href` is unsafe\n\n[`GlSafeLinkDirective`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/directives-safe-html-directive--default) can be used for that purpose.\n\nSince GitLab also relies on data URLs in some cases, we'll want to provide a way to set \"unsafe\" URLs that will skip the sanitization step. An idea would be to expose an `unsafe-url` prop.\n\n### Why\n\nThe javascript links can lead to cross-site scripting bugs. For example, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212630. It has been fixed by validating the zoom meeting links which should fix this particular security issue. However, other `GlButton` usages are still vulnerable if we miss any such validations.\n\n### Related Issues\n\n- [Allow only safe urls in GlLink](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/823)\n- [Preventing URL Injection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219124#prevent-url-injection)\n- [XSS Retrospective](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327824)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-15T08:18:13.357Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T15:13:25.590Z","closed_at":"2021-05-12T15:57:53.095Z","closed_by":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"labels":["component:button","frontend","security","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"}],"author":{"id":4019091,"username":"djadmin","name":"Dheeraj Joshi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/57dccb416bfcfac947a69c53c5585128?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djadmin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1379","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1379","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1379/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1379/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1379","relative":"#1379","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-ui#1379"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":84613078,"iid":1366,"project_id":7071551,"title":"Safe Html v-safe-html Documentation Confusion","description":"Sorry I'm not overly familiar with the project (gitlab-ui) and the documentation etc but there are a few things that strike me as odd:\n\nhttps://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/docs/directives-safe-html-directive--default\n\nRenders the example like:\n\n![image](/uploads/642e43282c3d7b8b851d830e45124449/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/bb8a5bbeedf5eabdaba71da2a87f308a/image.png)\n\nSo the `\u003cimg` tag is actually being rendered?

Component","description":"https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/input-group#input-groups\n\n\u003e Bootstrap v4 currently does not support contextual state styling (i.e. valid or invalid) of input groups. However, the inputs inside the input group do support contextual state.\n\nSo we end up having something like this:\n\n| GlFormInputGroup | Other form input (for comparison) |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/bcdb3fc58f1035783d068a8445441630/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/75598818f3a41b3e7cc5fc62a93d8f6f/image.png) |\n\n## Problem: No feedback message shown\n\nWe use the general sibling selector `~` to display the invalid feedback message, like this:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/2cf3f585f86b103e8e99f4a79379e69e/image.png\" height=300px\u003e\n\nHowever, this doesn't work for `GlFormInputGroup` because the HTML structure is different. So the general sibling selector doesn't work here.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/2d4192a16796778a69490f7fc28e5834/image.png\" height=300px\u003e\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's ensure the feedback is displayed, so it looks like this:\n\n![image](/uploads/4aef69bf97cb323d0b220a7338bb7fe1/image.png)\n\n## Solution\n\nAlternatively, we can just use the `b-form-invalid-feedback` \u003e https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/form#comp-ref-b-form-invalid-feedback\n\nIt was suggested here \u003e https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/1251#issuecomment-340065341\n\n(So instead of doing some funky css magic, I think this is the best route to take. I've tested it locally and it works perfectly 👍)\n\n## Follow-up\n\n~~1. We might also want to consider look into changing the default message if it's a `\u003cselect\u003e` field. As the user doesn't \"fill\", it \"selects\". So a more appropriate default message could be: `Please select an option`.~~\n\nA sibling component would be the `gl-form-valid-feedback`, we might want to also consider creating a follow-up issue to ensure that's available in PJ 👍\n\n## Note\n\nThis issue was created as a follow-up to MR \u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55838","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-11T09:21:01.974Z","updated_at":"2021-04-23T22:51:03.435Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T22:51:03.377Z","closed_by":{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","component:form","devops::create","feature::enhancement","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::source code","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1255","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1255","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1255/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1255/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1255","relative":"#1255","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-ui#1255"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":80620276,"iid":1252,"project_id":7071551,"title":"Update GlFormGroup stylings to be aligned with Pajamas","description":"### Context\n\nThe following discussion from !55728 should be addressed:\n\n- [x] @pgascouvaillancourt started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55728#note_525469956):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **thought:** Having to manually add this margin might indicate that the GitLab UI component might not be following Pajamas specifications :thinking: Do you think that there some change we could do in GitLab UI to make this more consistent?\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should add necessary margins for labels in GlFormGroup and make sure it conforms with ~Pajamas.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] Tweak form styling in GitLab UI, something very similar to [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/blob/15e9c17724049fdf26acb11abc67ff5d87cb1cb5/src/components/base/form/form_group/form_group.scss#L21), as per [suggestion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55728#note_525469956)\n- [x] Remove the `gl-mt-3` class from the gitlab codebase \n  - [x] This should apply for `\u003cgl-form-text class=\"gl-mt-3\"\u003e` elements\n  - [x] Make sure it affects only the field labels","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-10T09:40:00.271Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T19:59:00.882Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T07:02:10.391Z","closed_by":{"id":4339707,"username":"ohoral","name":"Olena Horal-Koretska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42796a7332b4608eb9785986719e7215?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ohoral"},"labels":["Pajamas","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::secure","group::analyzer frontend","pajamas::build","section::sec","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4210622,"username":"piall","name":"Md.

The editor team will use these dependencies to implement a Rich Text Editor component. \n\n## License compatibility\n\nTipTap and ProseMirror have compatible licenses with GitLab. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231725#note_413595037 for more information. \n\n## Requirements \n\nWe have to include the Rich Text Editor 3rd party dependencies in the GitLab application while meeting the following expectations\n\n### Performance\n\n- We want to load these dependencies asynchronously.\n- If the dependencies are not updated, we want to maintain them in the web browser’s cache.\n  To meet this expectation, the bundle where the dependencies is distributed should be independent from the bundle where the Rich Text Editor is located. The reason is that we will update the Rich Text Editor more often than its dependencies.\n\n### Smooth transition to TipTap v2\n\nThe methodology we use to load the dependencies should not become a hindrance  for the transition from TipTap 1 to TipTap 2 (currently in private development).\n\nTo meet this expectation. We should be aware of the differences between TipTap 1 and TipTap 2 distribution. [TipTap 1 groups all its dependencies](https://tiptap.dev/docs/guide/editor.html) and core components in two packages: `tiptap` and `tiptap-extensions`. \n\n```html\n\u003cscript\u003e\nimport { Editor, EditorContent } from 'tiptap';\nimport { Bold } from 'tiptap-extensions';\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    EditorContent,\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      editor: new Editor({\n        content: '\u003cp\u003eInitial editor content\u003c/p\u003e',\n        extensions: [\n          new Bold(),\n        ],\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  beforeDestroy() {\n    this.editor.destroy()\n  },\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003ceditor-content :editor=\"editor\" /\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nTipTap 2 distributes extensions and Vue components in different packages.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'\nimport Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'\nimport Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'\nimport Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'\n\nnew Editor({\n  element: document.querySelector('.element'),\n  extensions: [\n    Document,\n    Paragraph,\n    Text,\n  ],\n  content: '\u003cp\u003eExample Text\u003c/p\u003e',\n  autofocus: true,\n  editable: true,\n  injectCSS: false,\n})\n```\n\n## Implementation guide\n\n- Encapsulate the responsibility of loading tiptap packages in a single factory function. The advantage of putting all import calls in a single place is that we will only have to replace TipTap 1 packages with TipTap 2 packages in that location. \n- Put all tiptap packages in the same bundle using [webpack module methods](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/)\n\n![image](/uploads/30c69a300b042ca0120fe71cffe556af/image.png)\n\n## Context\n\nSee for a big picture of the Rich Text Editor development: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321442","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-22T19:26:28.242Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T15:39:46.076Z","closed_at":"2021-03-08T15:39:45.972Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"labels":["devops::create","frontend","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"}],"author":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1223","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1223","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1223/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1223/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1223","relative":"#1223","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-ui#1223"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":80483082,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":80504754,"iid":1246,"project_id":7071551,"title":"[VSA] Fix stage shape outline and active shape","description":"### Problem \n\n- Path component has a slight 1px bump and isn't completely rounded on the pointy part of a stage... this keeps me up at night.\n- Path component active highlight is a bit strange too\n\n| Imperfect rounding | Active |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screenshot_2021-02-15_at_17.16._2x](/uploads/891310f35c8d66d8952a318eebf3f7e5/Screenshot_2021-02-15_at_17.16._2x.png) | ![Screenshot_2021-02-15_at_17.16._2x](/uploads/d338185be0e2593dd6bba031515983d1/Screenshot_2021-02-15_at_17.16._2x.png) |\n\n### Proposal\n\n1.

Is there a way to account for an optional button section within the tab component?\n\n#### What next?\n\nI'm not on the frontend or foundations team so it's not really my call, but here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Leave everything as-is, and continue duplicating the buttons\n   - if we want to refactor this later, we should keep track of these somehow\n   - update the tab migration epic to include instructions for duplicating buttons\n2. Stop the tab migration altogether and either\n   - Update the tabs component to account for buttons\n   OR\n   - Change the design\n\ncc @agulina @afontaine","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-18T21:56:01.888Z","updated_at":"2021-01-07T14:04:27.062Z","closed_at":"2021-01-07T12:27:08.075Z","closed_by":{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo Gulina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28693a558066993ea93b7272208d285?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/agulina"},"labels":["component:tab","devops::fulfillment","frontend","missed:13.7","section::fulfillment","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo Gulina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28693a558066993ea93b7272208d285?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/agulina"}],"author":{"id":201566,"username":"annabeldunstone","name":"Annabel Dunstone Gray","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/85c0203926134720f9a9aa8c6e264c78?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/annabeldunstone"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo Gulina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28693a558066993ea93b7272208d285?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/agulina"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1074","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1074","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1074/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551/issues/1074/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7071551","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1074","relative":"#1074","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-ui#1074"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74559453,"iid":1072,"project_id":7071551,"title":"GlEmptyState - Image doesn't fill space","description":"### Summary\n\nThe `GlEmptyState` has a `svgHeight` parameter, but setting it only sets the height.

that can be used to render text with some basic button styles. Currently, this variant renders an inactive `\u003cbutton\u003e`, which seems bad practice in terms of accessibility as the label should be presentational only, so it would be preferable to render a `\u003cspan\u003e` or a `\u003cdiv\u003e` instead.\n\nWhen used in a button group, the actual button in the group could leverage the `aria-labelledby` attribute to reference the label

props to allow adding a link for the Call to Action button component that gets rendered, but this does not cover scenarios where the action we want to perform is not simply navigating to a new url, for example triggering a modal window.\n\nAdditionally, if we have not already done so, we should migrate the `GlDeprecatedButton`\n\n## Possible solutions\n* The could be updated to emit a `click` event when the Call to action button is clicked, this would allow users to hook perform an action after the button click\n* We could convert the Call to Action to a `\u003cslot\u003e`, allowing the
