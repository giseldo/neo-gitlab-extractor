However, when the we remove the group 2FA enforcement. The member is still forced to setup the 2FA.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Have a group with members who do not have 2FA setup and have subgroup\n1. Go to Group Settings \u003e `General` \u003e ` Permissions, LFS, 2FA ` \u003e check the `Require all users in this group to setup Two-factor authentication` box and hit `Save changes`\n1. Do the same for a subgroup\n1. Log in as the user who doesn't have 2FA setup, see the 2FA setup screen and unable to navigate to different page\n1. Go to Group settings and un check the `Require all users in this group to setup Two-factor authentication` box and `Save changes` for the top level group and then subgroup (The order is important)\n1. Log in as the user who doesn't have 2FA setup again, observe that you're still stuck on the 2FA setup page\n\nIf you disable the subgroup first and then top level group, it will not trigger the bug.\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDisabling 2FA enforcement for groups and subgroup still force user to setup 2FA\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUsers are not forced to setup 2FA after the group 2FA enforcement is disabled.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/46d0ba58687b642d69a3d15e00addb15/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com; GitLab Enterprise Edition 13.1.0-pre 7b98ce20ee3 \n\n### Possible Workaround\n\nEither one of the following:\n\n1. Remove users and add them back\n1.

Cilium installation status through the cluster applications project","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nNow that https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35672 is implemented we have a way to get a installation state for Cilium through the `helm ls` based artifact. Getting this state is necessary for a more performant metrics collection: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211532\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-05T02:08:40.159Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:56:55.268Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T00:31:57.788Z","closed_by":{"id":4825543,"username":"aevstifeev","name":"Arthur Evstifeev","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4825543/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aevstifeev"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","devops::govern","group::security policies","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":4825543,"username":"aevstifeev","name":"Arthur Evstifeev","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4825543/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aevstifeev"}],"author":{"id":4825543,"username":"aevstifeev","name":"Arthur Evstifeev","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4825543/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aevstifeev"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4825543,"username":"aevstifeev","name":"Arthur Evstifeev","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4825543/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aevstifeev"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220419","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220419","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220419/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220419/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220419","relative":"#220419","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220419"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3579,"epic":{"id":67648,"iid":3579,"title":"MVC: Record Metrics for Cilium Usage","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3579","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35456698,"iid":220413,"project_id":278964,"title":"Quickly resolve issues with your Cleanup policy with improved validation and notifications","description":"### Problem to solve\nAdministrators would like to use the GitLab Cleanup policy for tags at the Project level so that they can programmatically identify which tags should be removed or retained.

What we could do is have the worker save the error message for the container expiration policy and when the user visits the UI the error message is displayed. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this change\n\n### Documentation\n\n- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/#expiration-policy\n- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSuccess looks like we see a higher success ratio of policies successfully run/failed to run and that Admin can rely on the feature to work for their project. \n\n#### Metrics\n- We will measure this by looking at the overall adoption of the feature\n- @10io is it possible to track the number of jobs that succeeded/failed?\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-04T23:35:28.315Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T07:07:58.393Z","closed_at":"2020-07-15T15:24:17.969Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","Technical Writing","UI text","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220413","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220413","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220413/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220413/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220413","relative":"#220413","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220413"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2270,"epic":{"id":15539,"iid":2270,"title":"Cleanup policy for tags","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2270","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35455223,"iid":220406,"project_id":278964,"title":"SAST bandit container vulnerabilities","description":"At the point of this issues creation there are over 900 vulnerabilities found by klar in the docker image.\n\n[bandit Security Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bandit/-/security/dashboard)\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Update base image to use alpine.\n- [ ] Document `before_script` limitations ([link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pre-compilation)).\n\n## Curated list of container vulnerabilities\n\nThe Security dashboard contains a lot of duplicates.

vulnerable to a timing attack","description":"**[HackerOne report #889331](https://hackerone.com/reports/889331)** by `benaubin` on 2020-06-02, assigned to @dcouture:\n\n### Summary\n\nThe doorkeeper gem is vulnerable to a timing attack on secret credentials (such as access tokens) similar to Rack's CVE-2019-16782 as it conducts queries using the token on an indexed database column (which makes it possible for an attacker to learn an access token in linear time).\n\nVulnerability number: GHSA-3hv6-4m9x-jfgj\n\n#### Workaround\n\nThe workaround is quite simple.\n\nSwitch the secret storage strategy in Doorkeeper to hash tokens by default when storing in the database. \n\nI'm working on implementing a SHA512 + pepper hashing strategy (faster on 64 bit processors and more secure, using a peppered hash adds a slight additional layer of protection for little overhead), although SHA256 is currently implemented in the library. \n\n- `hash_token_secrets` (it's AccessToken#token value)  \n- `hash_application_secrets` (it's Application#secret value)\n\n#### Line to change:  \nhttps://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/blob/cba795448032e6f99298e71b43645b2ed4c17de4/lib/doorkeeper/models/concerns/secret_storable.rb#L94\n\n#### Implementation of SHA512 + pepper.  \nhttps://gist.github.com/benaubin/863b2bfb7f12c535e94c60dacfd25d07\n\n### References\n\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18605294/is-devises-token-authenticatable-secure  \n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26077553/countermeasure-to-timing-attack-against-sql-select-of-hash-token  \n- http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2013/08/devise-3-1-now-with-more-secure-defaults/  \n- https://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/  \n- https://gist.github.com/josevalim/fb706b1e933ef01e4fb6\n\n## Impact\n\nEven over a network, averaging multiple requests can disclose OAuth access tokens to an attacker in linear (or, potentially, sub-linear time). Rate limiting is not a viable mitigation strategy as the attack could be performed using a botnet, and attack traffic is indistinguishable from normal traffic, at least on the first request.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-04T17:32:22.443Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T15:02:54.914Z","closed_at":"2020-08-24T14:33:07.518Z","closed_by":{"id":4992072,"username":"dcouture","name":"Dominic Couture","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4992072/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dcouture"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","HackerOne","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::3","security","severity::3"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-08-03","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220364","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220364","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220364/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220364/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220364","relative":"#220364","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220364"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35443971,"iid":220357,"project_id":278964,"title":"Controller Admin::ServicesController executes more than 100 SQL queries","description":"### Description\n\nThis controller executes more than 100 SQL queries, the maximum number of queries allowed.

For now, only `Merge Requests` will be visible as per the existing dashboard.\n\n|Approvals|Merge Requests|\n|---|---|\n|![Show_full_list](/uploads/5b9ff7b5ea71bf4e93631ed7a92b373c/Show_full_list.png)|![Merge_Requests](/uploads/2f123f431e425407f905034f025af63d/Merge_Requests.png)|\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Implementation details\n\n1) Using GitLab UI, we will add the [tabs with counters](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-tabs-tabs--default) component to the Vue.js app on the Compliance dashboard\n2) Restructure the files of the Compliance dashboard so it makes more sense in terms of a tabular structure\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/yMzdPYTtuSj6XfTt3X77SW/and-3839-Two-person-approvals-for-sensitive-changes?node-id=99%3A6591)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-04T13:59:16.672Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T20:16:50.084Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T15:54:02.332Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","devops::manage","frontend","group::compliance","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"}],"author":{"id":5209897,"username":"rob.hunt","name":"Robert Hunt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5209897/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rob.hunt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220328","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220328","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220328/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220328/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220328","relative":"#220328","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220328"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3840,"epic":{"id":78542,"iid":3840,"title":"Two-person approvals: Frontend","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3840","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"},{"id":35435537,"iid":220325,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor target_details from AuditEvent details","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIn an `AuditEvent`, `target_details` is stored within a JSON hash.

The scanning job is triggered even though its `rules:exists` parameter doesn't match any file of the scanned repository.\n\nThis regression was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31932, when fixing another regression. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31932#note_355021318\n\nThe problem occurs because the `rules:exists` of the scanning job has many patterns. In the end the combined pattern is too complex, and the condition is skipped. This is NOT specific to Gemnasium and Dependency Scanning.\n \n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. create a GitLab project with no file GitLab Dependency Scanning currently supports\n1. include the Dependency Scanning CI template\n1. create a new CI pipeline.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/jobs/580452973\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job is triggered and fails with a `No match in ...` error.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThere's no `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31932\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThere's no fix but we could improve the error message. Also, we could remove the `rules:exists` param from the job definition since it's being ignored, and add a code comment to the CI config to explain this limitation.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Update analyzers and change the `No match` error to a warning, and improve the message\n   - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/109\n      - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/releases/v2.18.1\n   - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan/-/merge_requests/79\n      - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan/-/releases/v2.9.6\n- [x] Update the common package to change the `No match` error to a warning\n   - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/merge_requests/122\n- [ ] ~~Update the Dependency Scanning to remove the `rules:exists` from the `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job and document the limitation.

This paradigm is changing: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23847\n\nAs a result of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32811, `BuildArtifactEntity` has become out of date. Previously its `object` was a `Ci::Build`. It is now a `Ci::JobArtifact`.\n\nThis change makes this entity the wrong place to represent the `keep_path` and `browse_path` attributes, since they both act on _all_ of a build's artifacts.\n\n## Context\n\nThe following discussion from !32811 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @dosuken123 started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32811#note_352816672):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e This path only works for `archive`-type artifact, right? Does it make sense to expose it for the other type?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Maybe\n    \u003e \n    \u003e `expose :keep_path, if: -\u003e (*) { artifact.archive? \u0026\u0026 artifact.expiring? }`\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ? This would be more explicit.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e In the future, we should support _keep_ action for any artifact types.\n\n# Possible solutions\n\n1. Remove `keep_path` and `browse_path` from `BuildArtifactEntity` so all of its attributes are only associated with the single artifact that it's representing. Create a `BuildArtifactsEntity` that has a `Ci::Build` as its `object` and represents the collection of the build's artifacts. `keep_path` and `browse_path` will become attributes on `BuildArtifactsEntity`.\n2. Since updating the entities will require both frontend and backend changes, this may be a good time to migrate the features that use `BuildArtifactEntity` to [GraphQL](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/index.html#vision).\n\n# Removal Proposal (current leading candidate)\n\nThese paths seem to be already exposed in the [BuildDetailsEntity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/serializers/build_details_entity.rb#L34-40). Being that the action calls methods [defined on the Ci::Build class](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e8dae231bd89328255da141f0358bc00b807c9dd/app/models/ci/build.rb#L783-792) and the [path helpers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e8dae231bd89328255da141f0358bc00b807c9dd/app/helpers/gitlab_routing_helper.rb#L178-185) accept `project` and `job` params:\n\n```ruby\n  # /*namespace_id/:project_id/-/jobs/:job_id/artifacts/keep(.:format)\n  def fast_keep_project_job_artifacts_path(project, job)\n    expose_fast_artifacts_path(project, job, :keep)\n  end\n\n  #  /*namespace_id/:project_id/-/jobs/:job_id/artifacts/browse(/*path)\n  def fast_browse_project_job_artifacts_path(project, job)\n    expose_fast_artifacts_path(project, job, :browse)\n  end\n```\n\nThe `BuildDetailsEntity` is a fine place for those fields to be exposed, and we can avoid introducing a new entity. Simply removing these fields from `BuildArtifactEntity` and refactoring the GitLab frontend (this is internal API only) to find the field on BuildDetails instead of on each BuildArtifact achieves what we want here.\n\nPotential ~\"follow-up\": `BuildArtifactEntity` uses some performance-optimized path helpers that we might use in `BuildDetailsEntity`","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-03T22:57:38.297Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:24.139Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T13:17:31.966Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","backend","devops::verify","follow-up","group::pipeline insights","maintenance::refactor","missed:13.10","section::ops","severity::3","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"}],"author":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":38,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220244","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220244","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220244/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220244/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220244","relative":"#220244","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220244"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":35406251,"iid":220243,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project delete confirmation is insufficiently scary","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen you delete a project, a modal is displayed asking you to confirm.

However, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/828c3af6822db69bf50929ae3b74a6d76868b955/ee/lib/gitlab/database/load_balancing/load_balancer.rb#L154 catches these `StatementInvalid` errors and retries them.\n\nAs @engwan showed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32668#note_351497463, the danger here is that the retry could cause SQL queries to leak across transaction boundaries. For example, I think we demonstrated that this can happen:\n\n1. BEGIN TRANSACTION ...\n1. INSERT INTO ...\n1. after_save callbacks\n1. idle in transaction timeout happens, PostgreSQL severs connection and ends transaction.\n1. Some random SELECT or SQL call :arrow_right: `StatementInvalid` errors, EE load balancing retry runs again.\n1. Rails thinks everything is okay, moves onto `after_commit` callbacks.\n1. `after_commit` callbacks fail due to aborted INSERT\n1. EE load balancer code retries previous step before failing\n\nThe PostgreSQL client library shows `FATAL:  terminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout`, but I'm not quite sure if this is error is passed to Rails clients. I see Rails has a `QueryAborted` error for MySQL, but not for PostgreSQL.\n\n@engwan was also concerned about other cases:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nBut I'm also concerned about the other cases. For example, Web to DB network issues.\nThat would also be a StatementInvalid exception and lead to some queries being retried in a separate transaction right? 🤔\n\u003e\u003e\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-03T22:33:59.105Z","updated_at":"2022-12-18T16:03:46.848Z","closed_at":"2022-12-12T02:26:56.042Z","closed_by":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"labels":["Category:Database","Engineering Allocation","approaching-SLO","data integrity","database","database::active","devops::data_stores","group::database","missed-SLO","missed:14.3","missed:14.5","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","missed:15.1","missed:15.3","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","priority::2","section::enablement","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},{"id":9047949,"username":"stomlinson","name":"Simon Tomlinson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9047949/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stomlinson"}],"author":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"user_notes_count":63,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220242","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220242","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220242/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220242/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220242","relative":"#220242","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220242"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35404401,"iid":220236,"project_id":278964,"title":"Generic Metrics API MVC","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThis issue represents the first step we will take toward storing metrics generically for the purposes of storing aggregated and computed data.

informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay,

--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\nIn Gitlab.com, we use top-level groups as the construct that defines an organization's workspace. If an organization is using SSO, users are automatically added to the top-level group as Guest, which for some organizations is too permissive. In a self-managed instance, administrators can add users to an instance and selectively add them to groups/projects as needed. We need to simulate that experience for Gitlab.com customers. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nAdministrators can add members to the parent group for SSO purposes but they don't automatically have access to projects/groups underneath. This is one of the top reasons why customers want to disable inheritance (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33534). If we had this feature we could essentially ask administrators to add users to the levels they need access to instead of marking what needs to be excluded from the hierarchy. So a similar result but a different way of tackling the need.\n\n### Proposal\nCreate a role that gives no access to top-level resources. The experience should be similar to not existing in the top-level group.\n- The \"unassigned\" role should only be assignable to users in the top-level group via the UI or API. \n- A user with the \"no access\" role should not be able to list subgroups/projects unless they have been explicitly added to them. \n- If a user with the \"unassigned\" role is explicitly added to a group further down in the hierarchy, our existing inheritance model will apply to any subgroups or projects underneath. \n- A user with the \"unassigned\" role should not have access to any of the top-level group resources.\n- If a \"unassigned\" role user hasn't been added to any other group/project, all they will see in their groups is the top-level group. Trying to access it will give them a limited view of the group. In the section where the group hierarchy is normally shown they will see a message \"You don't have access to any resources in this group.\"\n- Users with the \"unassigned\" role are shown in the members list if they are direct members.  Users with the \"unassigned\" role are not shown in the members list if they are inherited members. \n- This role should be available as an option in the `Default membership role` in SAML/SSO configuration.\n- This role should be available in gitlab.com and self managed. Silver/Premium and above.\n\n### Further details\n\nA huge challenge with [disabling group inheritance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33534) has been the sensitivity of the underlying code. It is proving very hard to change. As pointed out in @mksionek's MR, we're now considering a [working group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28695#note_351664742) and doing more investigation on all the potential effects.\n\n* **MyCompany** (top-level group)\n  * *SecretGroup* (subgroup)\n  * **General** (subgroup)\n\nSince SAML is currently configured at the top-level group, users will SSO in. At a minimum, they have Guest access to **MyCompany** group, so they have Guest access to all subgroups. This includes *SecretGroup*, so it's not possible to keep the projects in *SecretGroup* confidential.\n\nInstead of allowing members to be in **MyCompany** as Guests at minimum, introduce a `No Role` membership. New members who are added to **MyCompany** via SAML or otherwise get added as `No Role`s to **MyCompany**.\n\nBeing a `No Role` means that you can do almost nothing in the group. While inheritance is technically still in place since `No Role` is being inherited into *SecretGroup* and **General**, it doesn't matter since you can't do or see anything with `No Role`.\n\nTherefore, I need to add/update my member's specific roles in *SecretGroup* and **General**. For a new member, I can just add them to **General** as a Guest ... Owner to give them access where they can start contributing. Their `No Role` access in *SecretGroup* means that subgroup remains a secret.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration, and end-to-end) that need to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact on another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nIn %\"12.10\" we introduced [compliance framework labels for projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118671) to help customers delineate between regulated and non-regulated projects. This is a way for customers to provide a passive notice to users in their groups and projects about a project's special requirements, but it also allows GitLab to provide specific reporting or settings inheritance for only projects with these compliance requirements.\n\nCurrently, there's no way to support organizations who wish to enforce settings using the paradigm established in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213601, but who may not comply with specific frameworks or frameworks currently supported in GitLab.\n\n### Intended users\n\n[Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nCameron should be able to navigate to a group and toggle a compliance framework that identifies as `regulated`, which would then enforce settings like Merge Request approvals in Projects using that compliance framework.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n![Segmented_control](/uploads/a79779de4ef2b47af36398d534cc1d26/Segmented_control.png)\n\n**Note:** The form this is being added to is available on ~\"GitLab Premium\", this control is only available for ~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Implementation\n\nEstimated weight `3`:\n\n~backend\n- Add the `regulated` field to the `ComplianceFrameworks` type\n\n~frontend \n- Update the read \u0026 modify queries to include `regulated`\n- Add the setting to the compliance label to the `form` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/287827 using

Let's take another example of a data breach: a particular user account was compromised, it is currently not possible to fetch login events on the user in the past 24 hours: `Fetch all login attempts for User X in the last 24 hours`.\n\nThe data that can help retrieve specific results is currently stored in free form text in the database, such as: `Changed number of required approvals from 0 to 1`, `Repository Download Started`, `Removed user access via system job. Reason: access expired on 2020-01-24`.\n\nIn order to make the audit logs more meaningful and retrievable, it leads to the need to categorize or label audit event types based on the action that is being performed.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eList of action types\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n| action_type                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------|\n| create_deploy_key                              |\n| add_email                                      |\n| add_group                                      |\n| add_project                                    |\n| add_project_access                             |\n| add_protected_branch                           |\n| add_protected_branch                           |\n| add_ssh_key                                    |\n| add_user_access                                |\n| archive_project                                |\n| change_prevent_merge_request_approval_reviewers |\n| change_access_level                            |\n| change_builds_access_level                     |\n| change_forking_access_level                    |\n| change_issues_access_level                     |\n| change_merge_request_approval_from_author      |\n| change_merge_requests_access_level             |\n| change_metrics_dashboard_access_level          |\n| change_number_of_required_approvals            |\n| change_pages_access_level                      |\n| change_password                                |\n| change_project_name                            |\n| change_project_namespace                       |\n| change_project_path                            |\n| change_project_visibility                      |\n| change_release                                 |\n| change_release_milestone                       |\n| change_repository_access_level                 |\n| change_snippets_access_level                   |\n| change_username                                |\n| change_wiki_access_level                       |\n| create_release                                 |\n| create_release_ios_daily_build                 |\n| create_release_job                             |\n| grant_oauth_access                             |\n| login                                          |\n| login_failed                                   |\n| login_with_bitbucket                           |\n| login_with_github                              |\n| login_with_github_failed                       |\n| login_with_google_oauth2                       |\n| login_with_google_oauth2_failed                |\n| login_with_group_saml                          |\n| login_with_salesforce                          |\n| login_with_two_factor                          |\n| login_with_two_factor_via_u2f_device           |\n| mark_group_for_deletion                        |\n| mark_project_for_deletion                      |\n| remove_email                                   |\n| remove_project                                 |\n| remove_protected_branch                        |\n| remove_user_access                             |\n| request_password_reset                         |\n| start_repository_download                      |\n| start_export_file_download                     |\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nWe can break the efforts into the following 4 stages:\n \n**Stage 1:** Capture `action_type`\n\n- Create a column `action_type` in `audit_events`. We have an option to store known `action_type` as an enum or in a reference table. To facilitate easier addition, let's start with an enum. \n- Ensure appropriate index is created for `action_type`. We will enable search on this field.\n\n**Stage 2:** Save `action_type` for new audit events\n\n- Modify all _write_ services to write to the new column (i.e. `AuditEventService` and `Auditor`)\n- Add a new field to the development [doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/audit_event_guide/) \n\n**Stage 3:** Categorise existing audit events\n\n- Examine existing audit events and start categorizing them\n- Perform data migration to populate `action_type` in batches. May require input from specific teams\n\nNote: Stage 2 and 3 can be executed in parallel.\n\n**Stage 4:** Expose filter by `action_type` in Audit event dashboard and  API\n\nOnce we have bucketed data, we can allow administrators to filter audit events based on the `action_type`.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eOld proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo start with, we can label audit events into action types.\n\nThere are certain action types that are common to most entities, such as:\n\n| Common action types  |\n|---------|\n| Create  |\n| Update  |\n| Delete  |\n| Restore |\n\nWhile, we can also have specific action targeted to entities such as:\n\n| Source  | Target | Action Type                        |\n| ------  | ------ | ------                             |\n| Project | User   | Export request                     |\n| Project | System | Export complete                    |\n| Project | User   | Grant access level Maintainer      |\n| User    | User   | New password request               |\n\nThis raises the question: do we want to filter action based on entities? It could potentially change how we store possible values for `action_types`, but can be addressed later with non-breakable changes.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nWe can break the efforts into the following 4 stages:\n \n**Stage 1:** Capture `action_type`\n\n- Create a column `action_type` in `audit_events`. This can be an enum field, as we want to know the possible values this column can hold. We also want to avoid free form text to make the field easily queryable\n- **To decide:** The `action_type` list can be large and will be evolving - do we want to store possible values in a yaml file?\n\n**Stage 2:** Categorize existing audit events\n\n- Examine existing audit events and start categorizing them\n- Perform data migration to populate action types in stages (for e.g. `login`, `project events`,.. can be done separate migrations). May require input from specific teams\n\n**Stage 3:** Save `action_type` for new audit events\n\nAs part of [audit event service refactoring](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5899) efforts, we can make changes to the service to accept a parameter for `action_type`.\n\nNote: Stage 2 and 3 can be executed in parallel.\n\n**Stage 4:** Expose filter by `action_type` in Audit event dashboard and API\n\nOnce we have bucketed data, we can allow administrators to filter audit events based on the action type.\n\nThis will also allow us to create template reports such as `Authentication and Authorization`, `Access Level`, and so on. It can also be enhanced to build features that will let customers create their own report based on the actions. And, it can be set to generate at regular intervals such as `Generate and email Access level report once a week`.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Future work\n\nIn certain instances, `entity` (source) and `target` may be different: `User A was added as a maintainer to Project B`. Here, the `entity` is `Project B` and source is `User A`. Administrators should be able to query by `source` or `target` or combination of both.\n\n## References / Links\n\nRefer to @djensen's [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216845#note_346928009) for wider context.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T17:06:01.368Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T05:04:48.175Z","closed_at":"2021-07-20T15:41:12.448Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["Next Up","backend","devops::manage","group::compliance","priority::1","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"}],"author":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220078","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220078","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220078/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220078/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220078","relative":"#220078","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220078"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2765,"epic":{"id":26374,"iid":2765,"title":"Refactor AuditEvent","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2765","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35324292,"iid":220061,"project_id":278964,"title":"Multiple QA pipelines failing due to potential Docker Login issue","description":"\u003c!---\nBefore opening a new QA failure issue, make sure to first search for it in the\nQA failures board: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1385578\n\nThe issue should have the following:\n\n- The relative path of the failing spec file in the title, e.g. if the login\n  test fails, include `qa/specs/features/browser_ui/1_manage/login/log_in_spec.rb` in the title.\n  This is required so that existing issues can easily be found by searching for the spec file.\n- If the issue is about multiple test failures, include the path for each failing spec file in the description.\n- A link to the failing job.\n- The stack trace from the job's logs in the \"Stack trace\" section below.\n- A screenshot (if available), and HTML capture (if available), in the \"Screenshot / HTML page\" section below.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nMultiple pipelines (Staging and Preprod so far) have started failing today due to a docker pull issue.

a script to associate MR creators by username after a BitBucket Server import","description":"## Current state\n\nA customer imported a project from [Bitbucket Server](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/bitbucket_server.html) to GitLab (self-hosted). Due to network/compliance restrictions, they weren't able to have a direct connection to the original Bitbucket Server. To work around that, they created a proxy Bitbucket Server (clone of the original) that has a connection to the GitLab server and imported a tarball export from the original BitBucket server. However, the tarball export did not include emails. When import was run from the proxy to GitLab, the original MR creators were not assigned (as the assignment is done by matching emails) and the importer user was [assigned](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/bitbucket_server.html#user-assignment) as the MR creator for all MRs. Additionally, a note was [added](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/bitbucket_server.html#user-assignment) to the description of each one of the MRs specifying the original creator by the handle. \n\nE.g. \"Created by: username\":\n![image](/uploads/efc07ba9b92ca2b7106afef58b6e5451/image.png)\n\nThe customer is now using the imported project but desires that the MR assignments are reestablished.\n\n## Desired solution\n\nCreate a script that the customer can run one time on the GitLab server after the import to reassociate the MR creator assignments. This script would use the fact that the usernames listed as creators in the description filed are the same as their email address usernames (the part before the `@` sign).\n\n## Links\n* [BitBucket Server Importer documantation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/bitbucket_server.html)\n* [Issue requesting that BitBucker Server matches users by username, in addition to emails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218609)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T14:27:42.027Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T00:59:08.317Z","closed_at":"2020-06-21T17:53:06.369Z","closed_by":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"labels":["Bitbucket","Category:Importers","Deliverable","Importer:Bitbucket Server","Unplanned","customer","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","milestone::p1","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220048","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220048","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220048/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220048/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220048","relative":"#220048","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220048"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5513,"epic":{"id":215390,"iid":5513,"title":"💡 Bitbucket Importer improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5513","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35319071,"iid":220043,"project_id":278964,"title":"Wiki pages with non-ascii titles may not be accessible","description":"This error seems to be due to a wiki page having a title that cannot be handled by our routing logic.\n\nEvery wiki page must be accessible.\n\nSee: https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/1601754\n\n```\nArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8\n  rack/utils.rb:599:in `split'\n    parts = path_info.split PATH_SEPS\n  rack/utils.rb:599:in `clean_path_info'\n    parts = path_info.split PATH_SEPS\n  rack/cors.rb:155:in `evaluate_path'\n    path = Rack::Utils.clean_path_info(Rack::Utils.unescape(path)) if path\n  rack/cors.rb:67:in `call'\n    path = evaluate_path(env)\n  rack/tempfile_reaper.rb:15:in `call'\n    status, headers, body = @app.call(env)\n...\n(50 additional frame(s) were not displayed)\n\nArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T13:59:30.037Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T02:09:53.898Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T02:09:53.886Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

repository import fail with older export files","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39201 we implemented the logic to export and import snippet with repositories. In the export logic, when the project snippets have repositories we create a `snippets` folder with all the repository bundles. If none of the snippets had a repository we still created that directory.\n\nNevertheless, in the import logic, we had the following clause at the beginning of the class that creates the snippet repository and commit the files: `return true unless Dir.exist?(snippets_repo_bundle_path)`. This means that if the `snippets` folder is not found, we don't need to perform the snippet repository creation.\n\nBut there is a bug in this logic. For users using old (but valid) export files without the `snippets` directory, we won't create the snippet repository, leaving them without the possibility to use Git on them.\n\nWe can fix this by just removing the clause, allowing old exports, and generating all the snippets repository data.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T09:44:07.671Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T05:48:47.056Z","closed_at":"2020-06-05T05:48:47.009Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","backend","devops::create","group::editor","priority::1","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220015","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220015","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220015/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220015/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220015","relative":"#220015","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220015"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35306339,"iid":220013,"project_id":278964,"title":"Microsoft Teams service API (create/edit)  doesn't work","description":"### Summary\n\nReproducing steps described at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/services.html#createedit-microsoft-teams-service doesn't lead to Microsoft Teams service creation.\nSelf-hosted GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.9.5-ee.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```bash\ncurl --header \"Private-Token: $glnswToken\" \"$gl/api/v4/projects/openmgw%2FSS_MGWLogMon/services\"\n[]\ncurl -X PUT -d '{ \"webhook\": \"https://outlook.office.com/webhook/4295accc-f365-4f74-ba9d-63f0a75ab4f0@5d471751-9675-428d-917b-70f44f9630b0/IncomingWebhook/b92ae1d457344244a02e241cbde0914c/2c2c80a5-2f2b-4edf-8d99-a73484f78c6c\", \"notify_only_broken_pipelines\": true, \"branches_to_be_notified\": \"all\" }' --header \"Private-Token: $glnswToken\" \"$gl/api/v4/projects/openmgw%2FSS_MGWLogMon/services/microsoft-teams\"\n{\"error\":\"webhook is missing\"}\n```\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n```\n{\"error\":\"webhook is missing\"}\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMicrosoft Teams service integration creation (so it works like it was created via Web UI).\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nN/A\n\n### Output of checks\n\nN/A\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nN/A\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\nN/A\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nN/A","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T09:21:18.295Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T20:05:28.617Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T17:48:53.253Z","closed_by":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Integration::MicrosoftTeams","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::ecosystem [DEPRECATED]","priority::3","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It can be turned off by running the following chatops commands in slack:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org web_ide_primary_edit false\n/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com

good to have the ability to either assign groups to the feature or assign individual users depending on what we want to do for testing.\n\nWe **SHOULD NOT** enable this by default in the %13.2
