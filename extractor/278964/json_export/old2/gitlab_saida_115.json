\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.\n--\u003e\n\nIn the effort of lowering number of components and DOM nodes, we'll be looking into abstracting `diff_table_cell.vue` to reduce component nesting and unnecessary complexities.\n\n\nSome loose thoughts:\n\n* Maybe functional template.\n* Move certain calculations to the line itself\n  * isContextLine\n  * isMetaLine\n  * ...\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/74968692e56039ab4b32085c1d64db38/Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_19.50.22.png\" width=\"500\"\u003e\n\n## Improvements\n\n\u003c!--\nExplain the benefits of refactoring this code.\nSee also https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\n## Risks\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.\n--\u003e\n\n## Involved components\n\n* `app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_table_cell.vue`\n* potentially, wrapping components too:\n   * `app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/inline_diff_table_row.vue` (parent)\n   * `app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/parallel_diff_table_row.vue` (parent)\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease select the appropriate label from the

@mentions long usernames make the autocomplete menu very wide","description":"## Background\n\nWe currently use `at.js` for autocomplete, which shows a maximum of 5 results. `at.js` is no longer maintained so we have been working on replacing it with `tribute`. `tribute` by default shows all results.\n\nWe turned on `tribute` on `gitlab-org/plan`. If you go to a plan issue (e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/issues/149) and type `@` then the autocomplete menu is very wide:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.34.24_pm](/uploads/f50b714d458fd14bbb3e644d947241cc/Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.34.24_pm.png)\n\nThis is because `tribute` is showing all users, which include groups with very long usernames and names:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.34.51_pm](/uploads/f81dbb572755742977853b2bc0733f0c/Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.34.51_pm.png)\n\nThis is in contrast to `at.js` which shows a maximum of 5 users, which is how @mentions currently works on GitLab:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.35.25_pm](/uploads/8cedd035a66478c91904992062e15427/Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.35.25_pm.png)\n\nHowever, if a user with a very long username is within the 5 results for `at.js` then the autocomplete menu widens like above which is existing behaviour:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.35.37_pm](/uploads/621528f14cead043a9ecf34677b5dbea/Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_5.35.37_pm.png)\n\n## Problem\n\nWith `tribute`, if we just type `@` then we have a very wide autocomplete menu. Visually this is not so nice when the visible dropdown username text are short.\n\n## Solution discussion\n\n- A max width could be applied to the autocomplete menu which would visually improve it. However, if a user is looking for a long username/group then they might not be able to verify they are selecting the right one since the username will be cut off.\n- We could apply a limit to the results shown by `tribute`. Instead of using 5 like `at.js` uses which has been an issue for some users, we could have a limit of 20? 50?

MR Diffs app state: Assess impact of removing discussions from diff lines","description":"## Summary\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.\n--\u003e\n\nIn the context of the maintainability discussion (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2852) it has been repeatedly identified that the way we're currently attaching discussions to diffs has resulted in cumbersome state handling and heavy objects being passed around through getters and such.\n\nThis effort will focus on making the state lighter but also having a more resilient way to always get the association made in simple and predictable ways.\n\nAnother aspect is to make discussions more DRY in the state, ie, deduplicate where they live in the state.\n\n## What will this focus on?\n\nThis issue will attempt at moving Discussions (full object) out of diff lines and assess the repercussions of such a change. If anything, we'll only set the discussion IDs in the diff lines.\n\nWe'll monitor the performance impact, especially whether this will incur in additional getters/watchers being created to keep discussions reactive.\n\n### Details\n\nWe've discussed the following scenario:\n\n* Bringing discussions into the component using `mapState`\n* Lookup the ID directly\n* ...\n\nDiscussions could also be stored in an object, keyed by linecode.\n\nIf we need to transform what's coming from the server, we should leverage a web worker to prevent the UI from locking up.\n\n## Improvements\n\n\u003c!--\nExplain the benefits of refactoring this code.\nSee also https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\nDiscussed possibility (to be confirmed):\n\n* Instead of attaching the full discussion in the diff line (which needs to happen for inline and parallel data structures), do so via unique IDs. Then fetch the discussion when necessary from the appropriate part of the state.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/6bbbb40b96b756ef84cd52b8af437cc8/Screenshot_2020-08-13_at_13.45.31.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e\n\n## Risks\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.\n--\u003e\n\nThis is a central part of the Diffs rendering.\n\nWe need to make sure all parts of the discussion lifecycle is working properly. Maybe adding some test coverage to be sure.\n\n## Involved components\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n* `app/assets/javascripts/diffs/store`\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n* Lighter state (memory usage)\n* Easier to update state of any said discussion\n* Quicker process of attaching discussions to lines (smaller objects being set/unset)\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e\n\nTBD\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease select the appropriate label from the following:\n    ~\"feature::addition\"\n    ~\"feature::maintenance\"\n    ~\"tooling::pipelines\"\n    ~\"tooling::workflow\"\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T12:51:15.598Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:09:14.329Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T11:12:49.219Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","devops::create","diff","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","spike","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235966","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235966","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235966/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235966/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235966","relative":"#235966","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235966"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2852,"epic":{"id":29505,"iid":2852,"title":"Improve maintainability and performance of the Frontend of Merge Request Diffs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2852","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69801207,"iid":235965,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project feature toggles sometimes get stuck","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nSometimes the feature toggles in the project settings don't react to clicks:\n\n![](/uploads/5d9518bedc5e22d72d77e3ed1c1943f9/project-feature-toggles.webm)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

[`Mutations::Security::CiConfiguration`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c7b00ec09cf0685579eabfce09083a3c4a5a6b0e/ee/app/graphql/mutations/security/ci_configuration/configure_sast.rb) mutation could be changed to use GraphQL types to describe the JSON.\n\n#### Context\n\nWe discourage the use of `GraphQL::Types::JSON` for GraphQL fields and instead encourage the schema to describe the structure of the JSON https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html#json.\n\nA cop was added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38125 to enforce this, however until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39406 the cop was only covering types and not mutations or resolvers.\n\n#### Considerations\n\n- Whether it makes sense within the domain to make this change\n- Whether we can introduce a breaking change (MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38406 was introduced in `13.3` so this is likely possible if done

Steps to reproduce\n\nRun a DAST scan on Red Hat Openshift. This might error on any Kubernetes environment.\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nThe customer is reported to be using the default template and the same image we have (i.e. not custom-built).\n\nThe following information has been requested from the customer:\n\n- The folder `/home/zap/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/jaydebeapi` should exist\n- The folder `/home/zap/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/JayDeBeApi-1.2.3.dist-info` should exist\n- Executing `pip list` should contain `JayDeBeApi 1.2.3` in the response\n- Executing `python -c \"import sys; print(sys.path)\"` should output `['', '/usr/lib/python38.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.8', '/usr/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload', '/home/zap/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages', '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages']`\n\n#### Next steps / Possible fixes\n\nIf the customer confirms that the system path is as expected, then the issue should be tested on a Kubernetes environment. If that passes, an OpenShift trial account could be used to help understand what the problem is.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T01:30:07.735Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T22:13:31.951Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T21:24:44.454Z","closed_by":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"labels":["Category:DAST","customer","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","missed:13.4","priority::3","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"}],"author":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235925","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235925","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235925/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235925/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235925","relative":"#235925","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235925"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69780186,"iid":235922,"project_id":278964,"title":"Boards - Use provide/inject for static props","description":"A lot of static props are passed through Vue components in boards while only being required in a few of them.

Ensure you have a group with a project that contains maven packages\n\n2. Create a group-level deploy token with the `read_registry` scope\n\n3.

This could also be tested using the available package as a dependency in an alternate maven project. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsing the group-level deploy token results in a 404 when attempting to interact with the group-level package registry. Switching the same request to use a Personal Access Token instead works as intended. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGroup-level deploy token with properly scoped permissions should successfully interact with the group-level package registry. \n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com. \n\n### Workaround\n\nUsers can work around the issue by using a Personal Access Token or by using project-level registry endpoints.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-12T17:42:07.811Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T06:15:34.551Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T14:29:47.136Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","backend","customer","devops::package","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":4554657,"username":"calebw","name":"Caleb Williamson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554657/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/calebw"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":9,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235822","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235822","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235822/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235822/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235822","relative":"#235822","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235822"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69771186,"iid":235820,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rename DevOps Score in the product to DevOps Report","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nLet's make it more clear that we have DevOps Reports in the product.

Users will also be able to create a new release associated to an **existing** tag via UI.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### [🔮 SEE PROTOTYPE ON FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/file/26zmxYHbMSqBtrDjY68hB5/Manage-Release-via-UI-gitlab-56026?node-id=4%3A4609)\n\n- In the `Create/Edit Release` forms, users should be able to select an existing tag.\n- The `New tag` field gets updated from a simple input field to a dropdown select, to follow the same standard used in the milestone select, as well as other forms in GitLab.\n  - ~frontend : make an update to the replace the existing component in the page\n  - The component behaves similar to the `milestones` field, and the field `environment scope` in `-/settings/ci_cd \u003e Variables`.\n- User can select from existing tags, search existing tags, or click the option to create a new one.\n- Tags that are already associated to a release are not displayed in the list.\n- When an existing tag is selected, the `Create from` input gets disabled in the UI. The user cannot select or interact with the component.\n- When editing a Release, user should be able to interact with the dropdown and select a different tag. \n- Only 1 (one) tag can be selected at a time.\n- The field is mandatory.\n\n#### Component behaviour\n\n- When user clicks the trigger, a drop down opens. The footer displays the option Manage tags, which should open the Tags overview page.\n- When there's no tags to be displayed: When no tags exist in the project/group, the dropdown display only the Manage tags options.\n- When tags exist: the dropdown displays a list of tags, ordered alphabetically.

Right now, it always searches branches, tags, and commits. For this feature, we will need this dropdown to **only** search tags. This work should be completed in a separate MR.\n\nOne technical consideration: the form that powers the **New Release** page is shared by the **Edit Release** page. Ideally, we should design this new feature in such a way that it also allows an _existing_ release to have its tag edited (to be set to either a new tag or a different existing tag).  However, this isn't a requirement of this feature and we should skip this if it complicates things.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members\n\n### Documentation\n\nYes, this will require an update to the Releases documentation.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nThis feature should be developed behind a new feature flag: `new_release_existing_tag`\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nCustomers will have the ability to select an existing tag when creating a new release.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nNo.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick this to collapse/fold initial proposal.\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://share.balsamiq.com/c/vBRsfsuKLLCHjRQdsQGC1J.png\" alt=\"Manual selection option\" /\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-12T15:06:55.221Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T15:58:01.732Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T20:51:57.038Z","closed_by":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Deliverable","Release::P2","UX","UX FY21-Q4","cicd::active","devops::release","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::release","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","usability","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"}],"author":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie Porter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4905402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jreporter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"user_notes_count":68,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235792","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":1},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235792","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235792/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235792/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235792","relative":"#235792","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235792"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4160,"epic":{"id":91718,"iid":4160,"title":"Draft Releases","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4160","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69767059,"iid":235772,"project_id":278964,"title":"🎨 Design/Research: Consider failing secure jobs when vulnerability findings are found","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nBecause our Secure jobs pass even when vulnerabilities are found, users may reference the pipeline view, see a green check, and assume they are secure when they are in fact not.\n\nWe have received this feedback multiple times that the current behavior is not intuitive.

*bug* behavior?\n\nOnly 50 projects load, user mapping does not when trying to import issues from Jira Server.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll projects load, as well as user

client-side query is trying to query the `project` field, which doesn't actually exist in the mutation.\n\n### Type mismatch for the `id` parameter\n\nThe ~frontend passes the `id` parameter as `ID!` when it should actually be `DastSiteProfileID!`.\n\n### Invalid ID\n\nFinally, the ~frontend uses site profiles' IDs instead of expected GIDs.\n\n## Solution\n\nLet's modify the client-side query to match the ~backend implementation.\n\n```patch\ndiff --git a/ee/app/assets/javascripts/dast_site_profiles_form/graphql/dast_site_profile_update.mutation.graphql

With this effort we should design and architect a way for other teams to easily add in new extensions as long as the data matches what we specify.\n\n## Design\n\nCurrently we have widgets like the below screenshot, they include a short summary and an expand button to see more information.\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-12_at_09.58.26](/uploads/fdda5d8a4211328390d7c22cc2859070/Screenshot_2020-08-12_at_09.58.26.png)\n\nCan we somehow re-design this to make the widget feel less cluttered and overwhelming? :shrug: \n\n## Architecture\n\nThis is the bit where it gets a bit more complex. We need to decide on way that allows for other teams to give us the data structures that we decide. \n\n1 thought for this could be treat these extensions as plugins. Each plugin **must** match a set structure that we decide, the widget can then take these plugins, iterate and then render the data provided.\n\n```javascript\nconst testSummaryPlugin = {\n  request() {\n    return this.$apollo.query({...});\n  },\n  summary() {\n    return 'Test summary contained no changed test results out of 126144 total tests';\n  },\n  expansion() {\n    // Return maybe an array that we can iterate and render?\n  },\n};\n\nmergeRequestWidget.register(testSummaryPlugin);\n```\n\n(the above is just a super simple spaghetti code idea)\n\nIt would also be good if the summary could maybe request a small subset of data so that we aren't request a lot of data for each part until the user explicitly expands that area.\n\nThis will be a cross team effort to get each part matching what we expect.

current page\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCurrently blocked by #233059 \n1. Initiate importing repositories, when \u003e20 repositories are available\n2. Click \"Import all\" button\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly repositories on current page are imported\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll repositories on all pages are imported. The text on the page is updated to reflect what will happen (i.e. the button states `Import 275 repositories`)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nATM we do not have specific \"import all\" endpoint for importing repositories in any importer, instead we initiate one-by-one import for repositories on screen from ~frontend. This will not work for any kind of pagination/infinite scrolling. I suggest introducing new endpoint, allowing us to specify:\n* default namespace\n* custom targets (when user specified custom target for project and after that clicks `import all`)\n\nPossible payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"target_namespace\": \"root\",\n  \"custom_targets\": [\n    { \"repo_id\": 42, \"target_namespace\": \"some_group\", \"new_name\": \"testing\" },\n    { \"repo_id\": 45, \"target_namespace\": \"some_group\", \"new_name\": \"testing\" },\n  ],\n  \"ci_cd_only\": true\n}\n```\n\n`target_namespace` is optional, but allows us to extend this functionality in future by importing projects to specific namespace","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-12T08:12:46.996Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T09:24:11.316Z","closed_at":"2022-06-07T06:04:11.391Z","closed_by":{"id":3672006,"username":"iganbaruch","name":"Itzik Gan Baruch","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3672006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iganbaruch"},"labels":["Bitbucket","Category:Importers","Importer:GitHub","Next Up","Stretch","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","approaching-SLO","backend","customer","devops::manage","estimation::completed","feature::addition","group::import","milestone::p3","missed-SLO","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":1212252,"iid":48,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 1-3 releases","description":"Issues which are not quite ready to schedule, but should be considered as part of the near-term roadmap.","state":"active","created_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235703","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235703","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235703/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235703/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235703","relative":"#235703","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235703"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5042,"epic":{"id":160337,"iid":5042,"title":"🏢 Scaled Experience for GitHub Importer","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5042","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69750160,"iid":235699,"project_id":278964,"title":"GraphQL: Board issue filters","description":"We need board list issue resolver to handle the regular arguments.

For targets that use external JavaScript/CSS, such as those that host assets on an external host/CDN, the page will fail to load in the Ajax Spider as the external assets will not be loaded by ZAP.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### Option 1\n\n**Use this option if possible. Go to Option 2 if this option fails to work as needed.**\n\nIn November 2020, ZAProxy's AjaxSpider extension [introduced](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3236) the ability to include URLs from external websites. We should be able to use that functionality to achieve the goal of this issue. It will probably involve updating the `python-owasp-zap-v2.4` Python package, since our current version `0.0.15` does not include methods to call the new AjaxSpider API endpoints. `0.0.18` does include those methods.\n\nHowever, @avielle was not able to get this functionality working during a spike, so we may still need to use Option 2.\n\n#### Option 2\n\n- [ ] Update the `ajax-spider` DAST test fixture to retrieve JQuery from a (CDN](https://code.jquery.com/). Update the dynamic link to be added using JQuery. Once this issue is complete, the test should pass without any changes to the vulnerabilities in the JSON report.\n- [ ] Change the context to include `.*`, not just the scheme/host/port [zaproxy.py#L48](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/b9dce357bfdb42c243b754f411cf1a59f99a7073/src/zap_gateway/zaproxy.py#L48)\n- [ ] At the end of a scan, find all scanned resources that are not hosted on the target. Exclude them from the ZAP `Scanner` to ensure they are not targeted in the Active Scan.\n- [ ] At the end of a scan, filter out vulnerabilities that are not related to the target host. These vulnerabilities should not appear in the log file and should not appear in the JSON report.\n- [ ] The external resource should appear as `scan.scanned_resource[]` and as a scanned resource in the log file.\n\n### Documentation\n\nGitLab documentation should be updated with the new variable.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n[Gold/Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-12T02:36:16.972Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T07:10:29.328Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T13:39:43.475Z","closed_by":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"labels":["Category:DAST","Deliverable","backend","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"}],"author":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235677","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235677","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235677/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235677/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235677","relative":"#235677","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235677"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":69744186,"iid":235676,"project_id":278964,"title":"It's hard to add a project to the instance security dashboard","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen using the GitLab instance Security Dashboard, you need to manually add projects to it.\n\nThis is done by searching a project\u0026#39;s name and clicking on it in the list of results.\n\nFor common words, it\u0026#39;s practically impossible to find the desired project.

According to [this chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/telemetry/#telemetry-systems-overview) the only flow of telemetry data from self-hosted to GitLab.com remains the `UsageData` ping.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4761#note_392334638 for the original discussion thread that proposed some ideas:\n\n- GraphQL recording when `DesignType#image` is resolved successfully (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4761#note_392345132 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4761#note_392347288) - although when the frontend requests data for the \"design collection\" we may end up recording a view.\n- A new mutation to receive view event data from the front end https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4761#note_392357923  which should try to limit the ability for abuse https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4761#note_392366190\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Use the new Usage Data REST API as described in point 6 at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/product_analytics/usage_ping.html#adding-new-events\n  \u003e Track events using JavaScript/Vue API helper which calls the API above\n  \u003e Example usage for an existing event already defined in known events:\n  \u003e Note that usage_data_api and usage_data_#{event_name} should be enabled in order to be able to track events\n  \u003e\n  \u003e  ```js\n  \u003e  import api from '~/api';\n  \u003e\n  \u003e  api.trackRedisHllUserEvent('my_already_defined_event_name'),\n  \u003e  ```\n\n- Use `design_action` as event name, this is already used to track creates/updates/destroys in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/0a13f74441c2e61bbeefb2825e7ad611ddb28f0c/lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/track_unique_events.rb#L7\n  - All of these events are mapped to the same `design_action` key, so we'll only get the unique users across all actions, not for each action individually.\n- Add a new feature flag YAML file with the name `usage_data_design_action`.\n  -

However, I can see a use case for this for sales moving forward as they evaluate different tiers with customers. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* GitLab customers\n* GitLab GTM and support team members providing information to GitLab customers\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhen speaking to a customer or prospect about the value GitLab provides, I should be able to quickly access the number of features in Ultimate vs. Premium, for example. \n\nTimeline is not urgent on this. \n\n### Proposal\n\nadd a \"badge\" (using [shields.io](https://shields.io/)) underneath each tier title that

running **On-demand Scans**.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n### Production code\n\n* [x] Update the `Projects::OnDemandScansHelper` module to include the path to the **New scanner profile** form in the Vue app's mount-point's dataset.\n* [x] `FF` When the form loads, it fetches existing scanner profiles via the `dastScannerProfilesQuery` GraphQL query that should have been implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233453.\n  * [x] Update the `isLoadingProfiles` computed property to return `true` as long as scanner profiles are being fetched.\n  * [x] If there are no scanner profiles, show a link to the **New scanner profile** form in the **Scanner settings** card.\n  * [x] If the query fails, prevent the form from rendering at all and show a specific error message.\n* [x] `FF` Render a dropdown for selecting an existing scanner profile.\n  * [x] When a profile is selected, a summary of its options is shown below the dropdown.\n* [x] `FF` When the form is submitted, trigger the `dastOnDemandScanCreateMutation` mutation, including the selected scanner profile's ID.\n\n### Specs\n\n* [x] `ee/spec/helpers/projects/on_demand_scans_helper_spec.rb`\n  * [x] `new-scanner-profile-path` is passed.\n* [x] `ee/spec/frontend/on_demand_scans/components/on_demand_scans_form_spec.js`\n  * [x] Fetching scanner profiles.\n    * [x] Shows skeleton loader while fetching.\n    * [x] On error:\n      * [x] Shows an error message.\n      * [x] Does not render the form.\n    * [x] No scanner profiles:\n      * [x] Disables **Manage profiles** button.\n      * [x] Shows a link to create a new scanner profile.\n    * [x] Scanner profiles found.\n      * [x] Shows a dropdown with the scanner profiles.\n      * [x] Shows scanner profile's summary when one is selected.\n  * [x] Submission.\n    * [x] Includes the correct variables in the mutation.\n\n## Related resources\n\n* Prior work:

Trends chart","description":"### Release notes\n\nBasic vulnerability trend visualizations have long been available on Group Security Dashboards and the Instance Security Center. However, the Project Security Dashboard lacks these, making it difficult to quickly understand any project-level trends on number and type of vulnerabilities over time.\n\nOur new vulnerability trends chart provides this needed visibility at the project level. Plus, this new chart is even more capable than the existing Group and Security Center visualizations because it is interactive. Toggle severity trend lines on or off with a single click to show just the data you want. You can also change the timeframe to see up to a year's worth of data. The trend chart is dynamic so it updates in real time to reflect your changes.\n\nWith the inclusion of this chart, you will also notice that the single-page Project Security Dashboard is now split into dedicated pages for visualizations and vulnerability lists, respectively, mirroring the Group and Instance Security Center layouts. The Vulnerability Report page contains all functionality previously under the Project Security Dashboard. The Security Dashboard page remains but will now contain the new vulnerability trends chart. Separating these features gives us a dedicated space to grow project-level security metrics and visualizations in the future.\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#project-security-dashboard\n\nImage: [vulnerability-trends](/uploads/03396ad342eea9b1324f48431e08111b/vulnerability-trends.png)\n\n## Overview\nCreate new metrics widgets showing vulnerabilities by severity over time (see [mocks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222448/designs/a01_project-dashboard.png))\n\n1. Default to showing Critical, High, and Medium vulnerability data series on; Low and Unknown are still available but user must click to toggle visibility\n1. Restrict maximum time scale to a reasonable length that prevents performance concerns. If no performance concerns, make unbounded or use first vulnerability's detected date. Otherwise, ideally we can do 1 year.\n\n\n## Documentation\nA new section on the new vulnerabilities over time chart is needed. Be sure to call out this chart is dynamic:\n\n1. Clicking a data series in the legend will dynamically toggle on or off visibility\n1. Using the zoom and scroll feature, you can adjust the time period displayed\n1. Call out any upper bound determined for how far back in time you can display\n\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- First we need to make sure that the Vulnerability Report page is complete.\n- Then we can replace the current project security dashboard and include this chart. Here I'm going to quote @andyvolpe: \n\n\u003e For the project security dashboard, we can leverage the [line chart with toolbox](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/charts-line-chart--with-toolbox) and include the [zoom and scroll](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/charts-line-chart--with-zoom-and-scroll) as well to save us from having to implement a separate time filtering mechanism.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-11T17:55:28.696Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T13:54:25.474Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T13:54:25.416Z","closed_by":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","devops::secure","documentation","feature::addition","frontend","group::threat insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.4","release post item::in review","section::sec","security dashboard","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"}],"author":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235558","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235558","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235558/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235558/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235558","relative":"#235558","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235558"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3428,"epic":{"id":59638,"iid":3428,"title":"Redesign Project Security Dashboard","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3428","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69715345,"iid":235550,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move Project Vulnerability Report","description":"### Proposal\n\nTransform the current single-page experience into a new layout and menu structure that sets the framework for future expansion and specialization of security components at the Project level.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\nWhen you are reviewing the failed tests in a pipeline it can be hard to tell if a failing test is a legitimate failure that needs investigation or a flaky test that will pass on the next execution.\n\nThe next iteration of the [repeat failed test counter](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#repeat-failed-test-counter) is adding a repeat failed test counter to the unit test report. Now you can see how often a test has failed on the default branch without needing to have a Merge Request associated with the test execution.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html#number-of-recent-failures\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDevelopers do not have an easy way to get the history of if a test has recently been passing, failing or skipped as they research a test failure in the context of a test run in a Pipeline.\n\nWithout this context it is hard to point at why the build is feeling/getting slower and what test cases may to be blame for that. Without that context it's not hard to imagine Delaney and Sasha starting to skip tests and not write tests for new code.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to use the UI with GitLab to see if a test has passed or failed more often over the last N executions in the JUnit report.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis is an MVC proposal to measure if there is interest / value in this feature. If there is we will likely re-architect this to be more scalable and functional going forward.\n\n* Display a tooltip / column on the Unit Test report for the data (see mock below but designs should be done by @jj-ramirez ).\n* Track page views of the Unit Suite page as a snowplow event we can display in the [group dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/633395/Testing-Category-Metrics).\n\n#### Backend\n\nThe `recent_failures` relies on [pre-loaded](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/ci/compare_test_reports_service.rb#L21) data which was only done on the MR widget's test report endpoint. So we need to do something similar for the endpoint used on the pipelines test report page.\n\n#### Design - See below.\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nBefore investing in time to architect a real solution for this to start on the epic for [Testing History for MRs and Pipelines](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4155) or even the MVC for [Test History for Projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210250) we will validate that there is value and move the feature forward with this MVC. We fully expect not to re-use code and maybe interface built as part of this issue as we learn what is valuable.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe should update the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html#number-of-recent-failures) to reflect that this message can appear on both the MR widget and the test report summary pages.\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n@zeffmorgan @rickywiens @samdbeckham - Can you ponder on some performance considerations for this section and edit accordingly please?\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n* Test execution data is tracked for all failed tests and displayed on the Pipeline -\u003e Unit Test Report\n* Pipeline -\u003e Unit Test report can still load as quickly as it does today\n* Page Views for Unit Test report are tracked - A [separate issue has been created for this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235524).\n\n```\nGIVEN a junit artifact is uploaded during an MR pipeline run\nGIVEN there is at least one failed test in the junit report artifact\nWHEN you visit the pipeline page\nWHEN you click on the unit test report tab\nTHEN there exists a tooltip beside the failing test indicating how many times its' failed recently\n```\n#### Measures of Success\n* This feature will be successful if we collect any feedback from internal and external users within 45 days of launch to inform the next iteration.\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nThe buyer for this is the developer who wants to see how a test is behaving previously to inform their current MR.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\nFeedback for this MVC will be collected in the [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/242233).\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-11T16:45:54.106Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T09:46:25.370Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T06:26:57.307Z","closed_by":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","FY22::Q1","GitLab Core","Stretch","backend","devops::verify","direction","documentation","frontend","group::pipeline insights","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"}],"author":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"user_notes_count":68,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235525","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235525","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235525/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235525/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235525","relative":"#235525","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235525"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4155,"epic":{"id":91690,"iid":4155,"title":"Test History for MRs and Pipelines MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4155","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69711085,"iid":235524,"project_id":278964,"title":"Track expansions of test report summary widget on MR page through usage ping","description":"#### Problem\n\nCustomers can view the test summary report on the MR page but we don't know how often they actually interact with the widget.

duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe single file editor and the WebIDE  appear to use different target branch naming strategies when generating branch names.\n\ne.g. `patch-19821231232131232131` (single file editor) vs `username-master-patch-1234` (WebIDE)\n\nThis name is generated when the user does not have permission to push to the branch being viewed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Edit a file on gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com\u003e, e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/edit/master/sites/handbook/config.rb or another project where you don't have permission to push to `master`\n* Note the value of the \"Target Branch\"\n\n* Edit a file using the WebIDE, e.g. https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/-/\n* Hit \"Commit...\"\n* Note the value of the \"Create a new branch\" field\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis behaviour can be viewed on the .com project, gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe naming convention is different and there are reports of branch name conflicts (via Slack)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe same naming convention\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSingle file editor:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-11_at_16.39.18](/uploads/c51cd4c6c2c623f5d0863cfeb443a1df/Screenshot_2020-08-11_at_16.39.18.png)!\n\n\nWebIDE:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-11_at_16.39.29](/uploads/dd7ad713f352f12a8a307947cca5e229/Screenshot_2020-08-11_at_16.39.29.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe WebIDE appears to generate the placeholder on the frontend, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ide/stores/modules/commit/getters.js#L17)\n\nThe single file editor generates the branch name using a call to `Project#repository#next_branch`, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/helpers/tree_helper.rb#L76).\n\nThis eventually just increments by a counter from all previous `patch-n` branch names, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/repository.rb#L738) (which explains why branch name conflicts can happen)\n\nThe best solution is probably to make it consistent with the WebIDE, which uses `getTime()` (time since epoch) which is far less likely to cause conflicts.\n\nThe `next_branch` method is used in a few places, so it's probably safer to adjust this in the [`tree_helper` method instead](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/helpers/tree_helper.rb#L76)\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAs discussed below, for now, we will update the tree helper method to use the username prefix and epoch suffix to match the WebIDE branch name generation.\n\nWe will need to add a comment in both places referencing the other, so that if one changes, the other will also be changed to keep them in sync.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-11T15:40:53.389Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T07:08:37.296Z","closed_at":"2020-10-29T11:26:29.744Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay

Because of this, simply removing the filter on group search pages would be consistent with our original vision for this feature.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-11T12:43:59.922Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T22:47:46.627Z","closed_at":"2021-01-05T22:47:46.581Z","closed_by":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P3","[deprecated] low hanging fruit","cicd::active","devops::release","frontend","frontend-weight::1","group::release","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"}],"author":{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235481","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235481","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235481/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235481/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235481","relative":"#235481","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235481"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69692782,"iid":235479,"project_id":278964,"title":"ActionController::RespondToMismatchError in wiki controller","description":"https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/1726282/?referrer=gitlab_plugin\n\n```\nActionController::RespondToMismatchError: respond_to was called multiple times and matched with conflicting formats in this action.
