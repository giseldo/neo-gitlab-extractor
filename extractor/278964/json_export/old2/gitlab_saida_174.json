Make sure to check if this issue has already been raised by someone else first to avoid duplication. \n\nFor each section below, please add screenshots or links or anything that may help visual learners understand the problem better, even if this takes you an extra minute or two this is a great help to some folks.\n\nhttps://www.learning-styles-online.com/style/visual-spatial/\n\n--\u003e\n\n# Problem\n\nThe GitLab.com trial sign up experience is currently [37 actions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/59241) and it takes between [five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zjek64d0g\u0026feature=youtu.be) and [eight](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a0cfGBmKh6LqDKNtXTbNXxw9vhGEc3kU/view?usp=sharing) minutes to complete.\n\nMuch of the reason behind this is because users need to interact with the customer portal in order to complete the trial sign up. Users should not have to encounter the portal to begin a free trial on GitLab.com.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe should move all GitLab.com (SaaS) free trial functionality from the portal to GitLab.com.\n \nThere are two categories of **Entry Points**: The marketing site and via GitLab.com\n\nWithin the two categories, the user has several opportunities to start a trial. The starting points of this proposal go through the user flows on **about.GitLab.com** landing page and **Group Settings** page within GitLab.com.\n\n![3381a33b-0046-4d27-8150-bde7ce97a8fb](/uploads/013b95f013cad67791a6199ff6ed4776/3381a33b-0046-4d27-8150-bde7ce97a8fb.png)\n**[Mural link](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1562801883705/80de3f0460ee4c2efeb3aa24e0717d2b93787e74)**\n\nThis new approach reduces the steps (steps as defined as user actions) needed to start a trial to:\n\n* **22** for a New User Registration using the signup form\n* **10** for an existing user from within GitLab.com\n\nThis is a significant reduction in user-initiated steps and almost halves the original 37 steps required previously.\n\n# Designs\n\n![Flows](/uploads/024d96e8d20f465d266a39771a658505/Flows.png)\n\nThis is a high-level view of the process and covers that of the two main entry point categories.\n\n**[This Prototype](https://sketch.cloud/s/v1zJb/a/mgkLnw/play)** will take you on a deep dive into all of the steps involved in starting a new trial. It should also give you access to the individual artboards for further reference.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n| Current | Proposal |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screenshot_2019-07-23_at_08.12.38](/uploads/fcd2086439a5c14d154203ebc8f3337e/Screenshot_2019-07-23_at_08.12.38.png) | ![03-register](/uploads/a16e0ef4df5b5d948610a7cce3833901/03-register.png) |\n\n* I removed the GitLab.com signup copy to help users focus in on their Trial Journey.\n* I have also introduced a new Signup Header Bar in our default colours (originally white) - This is to help tie the user into the feel of GitLab.com as early as possible. This Header colour scheme is a user option and it would great if for an existing user starting a trial, we use the colour of the Header Bar in the user's preference.\n* Full Name Input has been split into **First Name** and **Last Name** for greater consistency. There probably needs to be a longer discussion around developing inclusive naming patterns. Currently, the lead generation page for a new trial (on the customer portal) asks users for **First Name** and **Last Name**.\n* Email confirmation input field has also been removed as it would be beneficial for us to adopt a soft email confirmation flow during the New Registration or a Trial applicant. This would stop users navigating away from the process and keep them focused on complete=ing the steps. Work on a proposal for this has already been completed https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47003. \n\n#### Removal of Social Sign-in from the Trial Process\n\n\u003cimg width=\"300\" src=\"/uploads/0ba92c3188623de7d75f8867b3f94913/sso.png\" /\u003e\n\nBased on [ongoing conversations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/63500#note_191382479), we have opted to remove the ability for Social Sign-in, specifically for users during the trial process. The main reason for this is because if a user signs up with Twitter we do not currently pull their Email Address from their account and instead force users to complete their profiles via the Edit Profile page. For a Trial sign up this creates a broken and frustrating flow. I have created another issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/65023 to explore what happens with all of our third-party Social Sign-in options.\n\n#### Free trial signup page\n\n| Current | Proposal |\n|---------|----------|\n| ![Screenshot_2019-07-12_at_11.30.34](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/ae040b6e379eb1685a6068a8859cd717/Screenshot_2019-07-12_at_11.30.34.png) | ![02-free-trial-refined](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/46ce149ff71818cf45e423ddafd5cad4/02-free-trial-refined.png) |\n\nI originally proposed that we update the Trial Sign up page. [Free trial signup flow improvements: Trial Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/60956) has ongoing discussions around how we could optimise this page and it would be great to include this in the scope of work.\n\n### Design Specs \u0026 Assets\n\n* [**Marketing Trial Page Icons**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/tree/master/progress/tim/fulfillment/svg)\n* [**Marketing Trial Page**](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/tim/ee%2313233-an-improved-free-trial-sign-up-experience-for-GitLab.com-spec-previews/)\n* [**Full Trial Pages**](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/tim/ee%2313233-an-improved-free-trial-sign-up-experience-for-GitLab.com-trial-pages-spec-previews/)\n\n### Result\n\n* 95% of friction for users signing up for a GitLab.com free trial is removed\n* Minimise missed opportunities from trial sign up dropouts\n* A significantly improved experience as a first touch point for our users with GitLab\n\n### Rollout Strategy\n\n1. Ensure envs variable for Subscription Portal API credentials has been added (ref. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/7823)\n2. Enable the feature flag: `improved_trial_signup`\n3. Update ‘Free Trial’ link for SaaS in Pricing page (https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) to point to new trial registration url\n\n(3) and (2) can be performed interchangeably, as new trial url will fallback to existing customers portal trial sign up if flag is turned off.\n\n\ncc @timnoah @jjcordz @tbarr

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e  \n  \u003cpolygon id=\"triangle\" points=\"0,0 0,50 50,0\" fill=\"#009900\" stroke=\"#004400\"/\u003e  \n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e  \n     alert(\"surprise\");  \n  \u003c/script\u003e  \n\u003c/svg\u003e  \n```\n\nThis SVG doesn't do anything if accessed through the repository view (such as https://gitlab.com/rpadovani/test-gitlab-pages/raw/master/test.svg), but it triggers the alert if accessed through the raw APIs, such as https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/13337155/repository/files/test.svg/raw?ref=master (I can give access to the project, if needed).\n\nThis XSS doesn't give access to the user account, since the session cookie is `httpOnly`.\n\nHowever, we can do `fetch` calls from this page to the APIs, and they will have success, meaning we have almost complete control over the account.  \nWe can verify this trying fetching some more information about the user:\n\n```  \n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?\u003e  \n\u003c!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\"\u003e\n\n\u003csvg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e  \n  \u003cpolygon id=\"triangle\" points=\"0,0 0,50 50,0\" fill=\"#009900\" stroke=\"#004400\"/\u003e  \n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e  \n    fetch(\"/api/v4/user\")  \n        .then(res =\u003e res.json())  \n        .then(j =\u003e alert(j[\"email\"]))  \n  \u003c/script\u003e  \n\u003c/svg\u003e  \n```\n\nThis file is called `fetch.svg`, and again accessing it from the API link, such as https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/13337155/repository/files/fetch.svg/raw?ref=master, triggers the script, returning information about user profile: this shows APIs call work.\n\nI wasn't able to include the image directly in over a public place in gitlab.com, I think due CSP, but opening the image on the target browser would be quite simple, both leaving links to it, or doing a redirect from a website you control.\n\n### Impact\n\nBeing able to do any operation permitted by APIs on behalf of the user\n\n### Examples\n\nI was able to reproduce both on Chrome and Firefox, I attach a video on Chrome, simulating a valid issue over a private project on Gitlab.com.\n\nThe project is private (of course) and is available at https://gitlab.com/rpadovani/test-gitlab-pages\n\nI can give access to whoever needs it.\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThis is a stored XSS which allows a complete account takeover\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNo XSS\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee attached\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\nAny operation permitted through internal and public Gitlab APIs on behalf of victims\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n*

Grafana metrics in issue MVC","description":"### Problem to Solve\nOur enterprise customers who are using GitLab monitoring (Prometheus) are making heavy use of Grafana visualizations. When there are incidents, we have found that incident responders are having to copy \u0026 paste screenshots of charts from Grafana in issues so that they can share knowledge and information with teammates as well as keep the issue up-to-date so that they can communicate the status of the incident to stakeholders.\n\nWe want to give them the ability to embed Grafana metrics in issues using a link. We want there to be two types of embeds:\n1. Static (i.e. set to a time frame) - this shows what was going on when the incident happened\n2. Live - updates as time progresses - this is helpful to communicate progress on the incident\n\n### Intended users\n[Sasha the Software Developer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)  \n[Devon the DevOps Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)  \n[Sidney the Systems Administrator](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)  \n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nThis work contributes to the [Incident Management Vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/debugging_and_health/incident_management/)\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\nWe want to figure out a way to embed interactive charts in GitLab issues, both live (i.e. updates with new data) . and static (set to a given time). Right now it is possible to insert an image snapshot of a Grafana using an img tag in GFM and pasting the src URL from play.grafana.org. These charts are not interactive, but they will update with new data when the page is refreshed. They can also be specified with a time frame achieving a static chart. **This is possible today**. We will be updating our documentation on how to do this.  \n\nWe are also exploring how to embed interactive Grafana charts in issues. This make be via iframes or importing JSON objects of charts into our own echart formats.\n\nLet's follow the same design patterns we are using for linking/unfurling metrics charts from the GitLab dashboard.\n\n**To minimize scope creep of the MVC, we will be limiting this implementation for public metrics only. In order to embed and share private or metrics with limited access, we will need to think about authentication for Grafana \u003c\u003e GitLab**\n\n\n#### User Journey 1\n1. User copies links to Grafana metric and pastes it into a GitLab issue template\n1. User configures auto-creation of issues using this templates\n1. Issue is created automatically upon receipt of a Prometheus alert\n1. Grafana metric unfurls in the issue\n1. User can click link back to the Grafana dashboard\n1. User can refresh the page to see new data\n\n#### User Journey 2\n1. During a fire-fight User copies a link to a particular Grafana metric\n1. User pastes this metric into the issue description or comment and the visual unfurls\n1. User can refresh the page to see new data\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

As of the MVC, `allow_failure:` is only settable at the job level, not per-rule.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe will introduce a new rule action called `allow_failure`. This action defines the behavior of job after the rule is matched, allowing us to conditionally set allowed to fail in given conditions. This replaces job-level `allow_failure:`. The default value is `false`.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nrules:\n  - changes: *.doc\n    allow_failure: true\n```\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

first need to define which metrics we want to track. Implementation and integration within QA are out of scope and will be delegated to other issues of [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1617).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n**:white_check_mark: Sub-Epic 1: tools and analyzers** - ~\"group::composition analysis\" -  https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2093\r\n- Scan completion time on a specific project (assuming we have 1 per language/scanner) =\u003e I understand this as the time of execution of the analyzer command itself, after the CI has downloaded the image and launched the docker container. By doing this we can add that check to our QA pipeline, after extracting that value.

On top of that, the current features provided by Gemnasium can possibly be achieved without that architecture. \n\nPrevious discussion about Gemnasium vision: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWP7pbSeoKwpcQ4lHAQ-wdpOhWuEVrNEl96Kq0ljYkY/edit#heading=h.vx2ew0wta8dm\n\n### Intended users\n\n~\"group::composition analysis\" \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nCurrent architecture presents some **limitations**:\n- we cannot provide security advisories for packages that are published to **private registries** or alternative public registries we don't support yet.\n   - private RubyGems or NPM server\n   - public maven registry other than maven central ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/issues/39#note_191713249))\n- we cannot provide security advisories for **removed packages** (e.g. [a yanked gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/merge_requests/51#note_191614539))\n- we cannot have security advisories for **yanked versions** (like a [gem containing a backdoor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/issues/32))\n\nCurrent architecture has a **maintenance cost**:\n- to **maintain the advisories** that get new affected or published versions after first being published\n  - affected ranges have to be re-evaluated to apply to new affected versions\n  - fixed versions cannot be set in the advisory if the package version is not yet available\n- to monitor, secure, and update the **GCP installation** (Google Cloud Platform)\n- to upgrade the **package syncers** used to synchronize package metadata with the various package registries currently supported, like rubygems.org or pypi.org; they change over time and we've got to keep up with these changes\n- to **grant access** to admins, keep track of the permissions, revoke access when needed\n\nOn top of resolving above issues, leveraging directly the gemnasium-db repository would provide some other **benefits**:\n- a simpler approach for **air gaped configuration**, no need to implement a sync mechanism with the Gemnasium server, the Git repository already provides the necessary tools\n- gemnasium-db can be **forked**, allowing customers to maintain their own security advisories on top of what's available in gemnasium-db\n- a **simpler workflow** since merging a MR in gemnasium-db as the immediate effect of publishing the advisory; there's no extra step, and there's no possible synchronization issues b/w gemnasium-db and the Gemnasium relational DB\n\nAlso, directly leveraging the gemnasium-db repository opens **new possibilities** by making some features a lot cheaper to implement:\n- add **new fields** the vulnerability, like the [severity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8213)\n- support vendor package registries - this is a common need for PHP and Java\n- support **new package managers** and languages, like [Go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7132)\n\n**Important:** the goal here is not to throw away the server-side code, but to bypass it until we re-integrate or implement new features that need it.\n\n### Proposal\n\nConsider modifying the [Gemnasium client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) to use the YAML files of the [gemnasium-db repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) instead of the API served on https://deps.sec.gitlab.com.\n\n- [x] Make sure existing feature and short/mid-term ones can all be achieved without the server-side; this could be achieved by prototyping a fork of [analyzers/gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) that uses [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) instead of connection to the Gemnasium API.\n  - supports Dependency Scanning\n  - supports Dependency List\n  - supports Auto-Remediate (yarn)\n- [x] Evaluate the cost of such a transition See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/14630\n  - fits in one iteration\n- [x] Consider de-provisioning the Gemnasium micro-services infrastructure. This implies to make sure all versions of the analyzer migrates to the new arch (on self-managed instances using an old version of GitLab). See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/14692\n- [x] Find out what mid/long-term features would benefit from the Gemnasium Server, and how Gemnasium Server could fit in a new architecture where [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) is the SST for the security advisories.\n- [x] Documentation migration path and back-port strategy\n\n**What Gemnasium Server used to provide?**\n\nThe Gemnasium Server (API, postgresql DB, services) used to run Gemnasium.com.\n\nGemnasium.com had two important features that are currently missing in GitLab:\n- **package metadata**; in the project dependency list, Gemnasium.com displayed detailed information about the package and package version \n- **release notification**; Gemnasium.com notified users about new versions of the packages their projects depend on\n\nTechnically, these features relied on micro-services responsible for tracking the package registries (like rubygems.org) and automatically fetching package metadata. Gemnasium Server relies on a messaging system (NSQ) to react to new package or version being published, fetch its metadata, and notify users.\n\n**Why are these features missing?**\n\nThough **package metadata** and **release notification** could exist in GitLab Dependency Scanning, they have to be re-implemented and even re-designed. That's because the technical context has dramatically changed; the architecture of GitLab Dependency Scanning is really different from the one of Gemnasium.com. To illustrate, the Gemnasium DB no longer has data relative to the users and their projects; this data now belongs to the GitLab DB, and we can't simply JOIN user projects (in GitLab DB) with updated packages (in Gemnasium RDB).\n\n**Can Gemnasium Server complement gemnasium-db?**\n\nYes. There could be a separation of concern:\n- Gemnasium Server collects package metadata\n- gemnasium-db is the vulnerability database\n\nWe may need to make the two communicate to implement some advanced features, like vulnerability detection in new releases: the Gemnasium Server would detect that a new package version is vulnerability fix, and it would publish a MR in gemnasium-db, either directly or via an intermediary tool.\n\n**What about package metadata?**\n\nGitLab has a Dependency List but it shows no metadata for the packages and their versions. The missing data is exposed by the Gemnasium API but the Gemnasium analyzer/client doesn't fetch it (and these API endpoints are not public right now). But making the Gemnasium analyzer fetch the data seems like a bad idea because it would result in huge Dependency Scanning reports. A better approach would be to make the Rails backend merge this data when building the Dependency List. The backend would get the data from the Gemnasium Server - to be designed.\n\n**What about user notifications?**\n\nGitLab can already notify its users, and its DB contains information about the users, projects, and dependencies. The Rails backend needs to be notified by the Gemnasium Server about new package versions, so that it can react and ultimately notify the users - this would be similar to what used to happen within the Gemnasium Server itself, but adapted to a new technical environment.\n\n**Are we loosing the resources we've put into Gemnasium Server?**\n\nNo. We're changing the purpose of Gemnasium Server: its task is to grab package metadata, and to notify GitLab about new package versions. But it doesn't host the vulnerability DB anymore, and probably won't have to interact with it in the short/medium-term.\n\n**Don't we need a RDBMS for performance reasons?*\n\nbundler-audit only relies on YAML files, and it's proven to work.\n\nAlso, we can later on optimize the Gemnasium Analyzer using a RDBMS embedded in the Docker image. For instance, we could create and feed a sqlite DB when building the image, and the Gemnasium Analyzer would be able to query this DB at run-time.\n\n**What's the migration path? How to back-port?**\n\nSince [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) is becoming the SST, all supported versions of GitLab must upgrade to a version of Gemnasium that uses [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db), otherwise they wouldn't get the latest advisories. Ultimately versions of GitLab using the Gemnasium Server will stop functioning when the Gemnasium GCP installation is removed.\n\nGitLab %11.7 and older [use Dependency Scanning 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependency-scanning/blob/v2.3.3/.gitlab-ci.yml#L165) (latest version of 2.x branch), which uses Gemnasium 2 (latest version of 2.x branch), so the change will be effective as a new version of Gemnasium 2 is published. There's no need to back-port anything.\n\nGitLab %11.6 [uses Dependency Scanning 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependency-scanning/blob/v1/.gitlab-ci.yml#L137) (latest version of 1.x branch), which uses Gemnasium 1. A back-port is needed but the cost seems reasonable.\n\nGitLab %11.5 and older use versions of DS that pre-date the Docker-based architecture. There Gemnasium exists in the from of a Ruby script called [gemnasium.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependency-scanning/blob/11-5-stable/lib/analyzers/gemnasium.rb). In this context, the cost of the back-port seems prohibitive.\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Outcome\n- action items / results should be populated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/14630 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/14692","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-19T00:36:46.338Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T15:40:31.258Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T11:36:28.666Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","product discovery [DEPRECATED]"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12930","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12930","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12930/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12930/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12930","relative":"#12930","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12930"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1914,"epic":{"id":12353,"iid":1914,"title":"Drop Gemnasium server side architecture","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1914","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22978817,"iid":12927,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update eslint analyzer to 6.4.0","description":"We use eslint for one our analyzers in SAST, and are currently shipping v5.12.1 of this tool.

Currently, when sharing links GitLab doesn't recognize the new Designs tab or Design Uploads. This prevents discoverability and collaboration on designs for users.\n\n### Intended users\n\nAny users who use Markdown (issues/MRs descriptions, comments, MR reviews, etc.) and collaborate on designs with other users.\n\n### Further details\n\nWhen users link to the Design tab or individual designs, the GitLab markdown processors don't filter the links properly. This makes it hard for users to share links and direct other users to the appropriate area.\n\nThe links pointing to the Design tab and individual Designs within Design Management are being filtered in this way:\n\nDirectly to Designs:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12905#note_200916466 -\u003e The tab is not focused.\n\nTo an Individual Design:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12905#note_200916893 -\u003e The app throws an error `Could not find design, please try again.`\n\nGitLab currently supports deep linking for other types of links, like the `Changes` tab in Merge Requests:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14722/diffs?view=inline#diff-content-2b8546a0bacce548c1d0cfcce5686660b65bb066\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe markdown issue filters should be updated to support links for Design Management. Adding a rule for the `issue_reference_filter.rb`, we should be able to have something like:\n\n* [#12345 (designs)]() \n* [#12345 (design)]() --\u003e This one will be moving to a new issue\n\n#### Interaction with Todos\n\nWhen a user is mentioned in an annotation of a design, they receive a Todo that mentions the individual design. We sure ensure that the same reference for the design is displayed here as when linking to the design in markdown.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nPasting links to the designs in design management will not generate broken links in markdown.\n\n### Feature flag\n\nThis should be behind a feature flag, since it adds new queries to the GFM pipeline.\n\nThis feature flag is: `design_management_reference_filter_gfm_pipeline`\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe following documentation needs to be updated:\n * document new feature flag, explaining what it does and how to configure it\n * document the new reference type, explaining where it can be used\n\n### Links /

The backend support is being addressed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12258. \n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Since computed metrics are still behind a feature flag, this field will instead be the existing, dropdown variant.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nBoth the cluster health and metrics dashboards should be able to add multiple alerts\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12258\n\n\n| MR | Status | Details\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| !23119 | In Dev | This is the feature flag being pushed from the backend to the frontend |\n| !23120 | In Dev | All the new vuex related things that will handle the alert creation, deletion, updating, etc. |","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-17T14:29:10.958Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T17:15:18.591Z","closed_at":"2022-01-27T17:15:18.127Z","closed_by":{"id":9304687,"username":"abellucci","name":"Alana Bellucci","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9304687/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abellucci"},"labels":["Category:APM alerts","Category:Incident Management","Category:Metrics","Charts","Enterprise Edition","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::monitor","frontend","group::observability","missed-deliverable","missed:12.6","release post item","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

GraphQL to render Epics Tree (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10795), so API already supports all necessary keys required to render Roadmap for any group. Using GraphQL to render Roadmap will allow us to use single query file in both the places, thus having SSoT for networking logic for both Epics and Roadmap.\n\n## Current Rails API Implementation for Roadmap\n\nCurrent Rails API for Roadmap supports following query params;\n\n*  `state`: State of Epics to show, possible values; `all`, `opened` \u0026 `closed`.\n*  `start_date`: Start date in `YYYY-M-D` format from which Epics with provided start date exist.\n*  `end_date`: Finish date in `YYYY-M-D` format from which Epics with provided finish date exist.\n*  `layout` [optional]: Preset value when user clicks it on UI, possible values; `QUARTERS`, `MONTHS` \u0026 `WEEKS`. This param is only sent when user changes the preset.\n\nAlso, the group information is part of endpoint URL itself. For eg; URL to fetch all Epics within `gitlab-org` group on GitLab.com is `/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics.json`, with above params sent as query params.\n\n## Current GraphQL API implementation for Epics\n\nCurrent GraphQL query used for Epic Tree requires following variables;\n\n*  `fullPath`: Group within which we're looking for Epics.\n*  `iid`: ID of Epic for which we want to fetch child items (attached Epics \u0026 Issues).\n*  `pageSize`: Number of items to fetch. Default upper limit for GraphQL backend is `100`.\n*  `epicEndCursor` [optional]: Cursor position for pagination in Epics list.\n*  `issueEndCursor` [optional]: Cursor position for pagination in Issues list.\n\nIf we were to use GraphQL API for Roadmap at a group level, we'd have to make `iid` variable to be optional such that the query allows to fetch all top-level epics for provided group, and additionally support `startDate`, `endDate`, `state` and `layout` variables (all being optional when used within Epics to render tree).","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-17T12:28:32.465Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:56:18.102Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T18:01:53.597Z","closed_by":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Enterprise Edition","GraphQL","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::plan","epics","frontend","group::product planning","missed:12.4","missed:12.5","missed:12.6","missed:12.7","roadmaps","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"}],"author":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"user_notes_count":57,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12887","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12887","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12887/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12887/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12887","relative":"#12887","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12887"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1998,"epic":{"id":13325,"iid":1998,"title":"Roadmaps Category Maturity: Viable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1998","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 28, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22921612,"iid":12883,"project_id":278964,"title":"OR for Events in Cycle Analytics","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\nIn Cycle Analytics one of the stages has a multi-part definition; the Issue stage is defined as \"the time from Issue creation to the first comment or MR creation\".

However, they can see the  `Private project Path` including `label IDs` because the issue was moved from private to public.\n\nAlso, The below API reveals the names of these labels too. This should not be disclosed as these labels belonged to private projects.\n\n`https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cProject_ID\u003e/issues/\u003cCurrent_Issue_ID\u003e/resource_label_events`\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create an issue in your private project.  \n2. Apply labels to it ( repeat this multiple times by adding removing new labels)  \n3. Now move this issue in one of your public project.  \n4. Login as non member.  \n5. Visit the above issue in public project. You will see that issue has lot of label events which discloses the label ID along with private project path from which the issue is moved from.  \n6. Now visit the API `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cProject_ID\u003e/issues/\u003cCurrent_Issue_ID\u003e/resource_label_events` and this will disclose all the label names too\n\n\n### Examples  \nYou can see my project url here `https://gitlab.com/newgroup_t/gemnasium-db/issues/9`\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen issue is moved from private project to public project, the timeline activity of issue shows the private project path if the issue had labels applied in private project.\n\nThe `Resource_label_events` API also reveals the labels names too which belonged to private project.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe private project path should not be visible and label names should not be disclosed in `Resource_label_events` API\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too!\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\n1. Private project Path is visible when issue is moved from private project to public project only when there are label events\n\n2. `Resource_label_events API reveals all the label names too that were applied in private project!","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-16T15:45:39.291Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:06:35.434Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T11:08:00.357Z","closed_by":{"id":4056133,"username":"jeremymatos","name":"Jeremy Matos","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c972d878793ca2302186e5d8c0c0dd8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremymatos"},"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-09-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30163","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30163","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30163/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30163/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#30163","relative":"#30163","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#30163"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24699775,"iid":30161,"project_id":278964,"title":"Expose mergeable_discussions_state and has_conflicts in Merge Request API","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nSeveral teams use external \"bots\" to do Merge Request checking and processing; when a MR is submitted to the bot with unresolved discussions or conflicts, the bot has no way to detect that from the API and does not return a useful error when merge is attempted.

This is invisible for user and will be retried, but it spams our error tracking system(sentry). And can potentially cause problems for users once we accumulate many acme orders...\n1. acme order expiration time is `7 days` by default. This means that we will actually retry certificate creation only after a week, and user has no interface to retry it earlier. I tried to reduce this time to `2 hours`, but it caused us to hit another rate limit: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/197978.\n\n# Kinds of errors\n\nMost of the errors on gitlab.com are failed domain verification challenges. Some of the users might have transferred their domains to other services.\n\nSome other options:\n1. generic API error(I can think about only one way of reproducing this - saving wrong account private key)\n1. Challenges taking too long to pass - this can be caused by misconfigured pages daemon or firewall settings\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/66107#note_208550895\n\n# Proposed solution\n\n1. Only try to obtain the certificate once.\n1. In case of any errors:\n    1. mark domain as failed for Let's Encrypt validation, and not retry it\n    1. notify the owner of the project by email(as we currently do for our own validation), similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/60787452eaff915d645d979cdca80156f5c2aacf/app/views/notify/pages_domain_disabled_email.html.haml#L4\n    1. Change message to \"Something went wrong while obtaining Let's Encrypt certificate\" on the certificate section, also change color to warning: \n![Error](/uploads/282677d99873bb1c0f9030a3ac1a05c5/Error.png)\n    1. Add a \"Retry\" button to this error message\n    1. When \"Retry\" button is pressed, remove error state, and change message back to \"GitLab is obtaining a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for this domain. This process can take some time. Please try again later.\"\n\n1. [ ]  As part of this solution, we need to enable the silenced `pages_domain_ssl_renewal` alerts in AlertManager as discussed in this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/merge_requests/2002\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOld description\u003c/summary\u003e\n1. I think in the first case we should just show a generic message like `GitLab couldn't obtain Let's Encrypt's certificates, please ask your system administrator to check the logs`, because displaying actual error might create a security risk.\n1. For the second case, I would show something like `Let's Encrypt couldn't verify your domain, please check that your domain is properly served by gitlab pages and ask your system administrator to check pages configuration and logs.`\n\nNote: jugging from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/66107 example I would say that displaying the error to user would be a bad idea since it can contain private information(it doesn't contain in that case, but these logs look more like a system information.\n\nI would put this kind of errors to sentry and logs for the start.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\nExtracted from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/28996","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-16T07:51:20.203Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T10:25:39.389Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T15:24:49.506Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Pages","Release::P2","Technical Writing","UI text","UX","backend","cicd::active","customer","devops::release","frontend","group::release","maintenance::refactor","missed-SLO","missed:12.10","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},{"id":3719688,"username":"mnichols1","name":"Mike Nichols","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3719688/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mnichols1"}],"author":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"user_notes_count":63,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30146","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30146","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30146/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30146/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#30146","relative":"#30146","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#30146"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":766,"epic":{"id":3437,"iid":766,"title":"Improve certificate handling for Pages","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/766","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22820708,"iid":12868,"project_id":278964,"title":"master:broken - missing translations for gitlab.pot","description":"```\n*** Running rake task: lint:static_verification ***\n!!!

The pipeline was in failure. When a more recent pipeline ran and is successful, the pipeline taken into consideration for the merge request is not the successful one and, when the configuration allows to merge the MR only when the pipeline is successfull, this bug wrongly blocks the approval process!\n\n### Why it happens\n\nWhen users push a new commit to a merge request (i.e. source branch), there are two pipeline creation events happen 1. `push` pipeline creation 2. `merge-requests` pipeline creation. Most of the pipeline, the `merge-requests` pipeline creation is filtered out by the default `only/except` rules i.e. `only: [branches, tags]`, however, when the gitlab-ci.yml is invalid, the `merge-requests` pipeline creation reacts to the event and thus creates two pipelines regardless of that the MR author doesn't have an intention to turn on [Pipelines for merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/).\n\nWe should ignore pipeline creation when yaml is invalid.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWe don't know why the detached label was affected... Documentation is unclear about it...\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nA failing pipeline with the `detached` label is taken into consideration as result for a MR while a most recent and succesfull exists.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe most recent successful pipeline should be taken into consideration.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![merge_request_pipeline_ignored](/uploads/c2052caffeb145f17559536b2e9e3a60/merge_request_pipeline_ignored.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\nGitLab version: GitLab Enterprise Edition 11.11.5-ee, Silver\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-15T12:53:55.608Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T14:51:01.431Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T12:17:59.415Z","closed_by":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","Category:Merge Trains","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","cicd::active","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:12.10","missed:12.7","missed:12.8","missed:12.9","missed:13.10","missed:13.5","pipeline","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It seems it is only leveraged in retire.js analyzer, not in the [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python). We would like gemnasium-python to use this variable to switch between python versions. \n\n### Intended users\n\n~\"Persona: Software developer\" \n\n### Proposal\n \n~~Make gemnasium-python leverage `DS_PYTHON_VERSION` to switch b/w different versions of Python run-time, or build different multiple images to cover multiple versions of Python, and inject `DS_PYTHON_VERSION` in the `image:name` of the `gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning` job.~~\n\n~~**TBD:** Would we only support major versions of Python, or would we support all minor versions?~~\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n**The proper long term solution is splitting build and analyze steps, as a result, the work has moved to this epic - https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3974. Please report any issues in that epic. Please specify your python version as well as any error message logs.**\n\n\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo special permissions\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] Update the documentation for `DS_PYTHON_VERSION` in [Dependency Scanning documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#available-variables)\n\n### Testing\n\nTo be tested during automatic QA using specific branches of [python-pip](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip) and [python-pipenv](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv].\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers should be able to switch between python

This means that users that are deactivated in the identity provider are automatically deactivated in GitLab. Previously, this required a manual step.\n\n[SAML SSO](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/) was originally introduced as a feature for groups on GitLab.com. We should extend this feature beyond GitLab.com and make it usable for self-managed instances. \n\n## Problem statement\n\nSAML SSO was primarily created to serve as a mechanism for groups on GitLab.com to begin using SAML SSO. We've iterated on this and created a nice feature with attractive features like SSO enforcement and group-managed accounts. We'd like to keep iterating and add capabilities like [group sync](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/118) for permissions.\n\nHowever, Group SSO is largely for GitLab.com and not self-managed. On [self-managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/saml.html#saml-omniauth-provider), we offer a different set of capabilities. For example:\n\n* Self-managed offers Required Groups, Admin Groups, Auditor Groups, and 2FA bypass.\n* GitLab.com does not offer the above, but offers capabilities like SSO enforcement, group-managed accounts, and SCIM.\n\nIdeally, SAML capabilities should be identical across delivery mechanisms and not require us to develop these features on separate tracks:\n* A self-managed instance using SAML should be able to use SCIM and SSO enforcement.\n\n## Proposal\n\nTBD\n\n## Links\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/13965","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-14T22:37:01.318Z","updated_at":"2022-12-26T01:17:06.065Z","closed_at":"2022-10-03T01:23:21.251Z","closed_by":{"id":12519771,"username":"adil.farrukh","name":"Adil Farrukh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12519771/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adil.farrukh"},"labels":["CAB Takeaway","CAB Takeaway Q3 FY2022","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","FY23:ROADMAP","Stretch","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","missed:15.3","planning priority","saml","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":90,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":33,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12823","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12823","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12823/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12823/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12823","relative":"#12823","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12823"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3182,"epic":{"id":47657,"iid":3182,"title":"Parity between GitLab.com and self-managed","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3182","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24699651,"iid":30101,"project_id":278964,"title":"Generate Run Pipeline form with pre-filled variables from .gitlab-ci.yml","description":"### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nPreviously when you wanted to manually run a pipeline, you needed to know the relevant variables and then enter them on the \"Run Pipeline\" page. This can be tediously and error-prone if there are numerous key/value pairs to enter. Now the Run Pipeline form wil generate with pre-filled variables for your pipeline based on the variable definitions in your .gitlab-ci.yml file.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nOn the Pipelines page ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines)) when `Run Pipeline` button is selected, the \"Run Pipeline\" form ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines/new)) only displays a simplistic form that assumes the user knows every variable name (key) and value that needs to be entered which is problematic for these reasons:\n- user may not know all the required variable key/values that must be entered\n- the task is tedious and inefficient when there are many key/values to enter \n- manual entry is error-prone\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* Any user that needs to manually trigger pipelines, typically a developer or devops engineer  \n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen `Run Pipeline` is selected, the form that allows the user to add variable definitions for running a pipeline or playing a job has pre-filled key/value pairs in the input fields based on variable definitions in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.\n\nExample:\n  ```yaml\n variables:\n   TEST:\n     value: \"some value\" # this would be the default value\n     description: \"This variable makes cakes delicious\" # makes this variable appear on the Run Pipeline form\n```\n\nNOTE: Only variables with keyword `description` will pre-fill on the Run Pipeline form. This is to differentiate variables to surface as \"inputs\" vs variables just for passing information between jobs; we want to avoid surfacing **all** variables in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` as \"inputs\". \n\n### Further details\n\nClarifications and notes from comments:\n1. Variables defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` are pipeline inputs at the root level (not job inputs)\n1. \"Play manual job\" button is not in scope for this issue\n\n\n[Original author's note] We have about 100 developers who are running pipelines or playing jobs daily and need to set 6-10 variables every time they do so.  Having to cut and paste each variable name in addition to the value is tedious, and potentially time consuming if they leave out a required variable and have to start another pipeline.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Note that I have only tested with a couple of `small` queries to not cause any service disruption.\n\nURL: https://gitlab.com/api/graphql through https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer or using any http client  \nAuthentication: None needed  \nIP used: 81.224.134.248, all of the tests were carried out manually.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. There is no preconditions other than having curl/postman/insomnia or using the graphql-explorer  \n2. Use the following body in the GraphQL call, you can increase the number of nested levels indefinitely getting an exponentially larger response each time.\n\n```  \nquery allSchemaTypes {  \n    __schema {  \n        types {  \n            fields {  \n                type{  \n                    fields {  \n                        type {  \n                            fields {  \n                                type {  \n                                    fields {  \n                                        name  \n                                    }  \n                                }  \n                            }  \n                        }  \n                    }  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}\n```  \n3. Press send in Postman or through the graphql-explorer\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact if this attack were to be executed could be denial of service and reducing the availability of the GraphQL API. Depending on the underlying architecture the attack could be cascading as it can potentially use all resources on the web-server.\n\n### Examples\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nA call with the example body resulted in a request with a response of the size 93.5 KB. Nesting one level further resulted in a request with the response size being 139.36 KB. As you can see the size is increasing by each nesting and there is no limit on how many levels one can ask for (as far as I can tell). The largest query I ran before stopping took 18341 ms and had a response size of 2.35 MB.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this applies to all circular relationships in the schema not only to the introspection query that is being used in this example.\n\nA malicious party could write a simple script generating a huge query and execute it in parallel causing the web server(s) to run out of resources handling the requests due to CPU and/or RAM consumption.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI would expect to get an error message after an arbitrary number of levels as usually each API has a max number of levels that is reasonable. I would also expect to have a rate limit on query complexity as usually there are parts of the schema that might be heavier or less likely to be cached than others, etc.\n\nThere are multiple strategies on how to deal with this type of attack, you can either rate limit on depth (levels of nesting), on complexity, on query size and so on.

Using Exceptions intentionally as flow control like this isn't a great idea, and as it exists we only return a single error message, even if multiple errors are detectable. We should run all of our available error detection in Config and return an array of error messages (which already exists to some extent) in the event that any things are wrong.\n\n## Improvements\n\nRemoving Exceptions from our application where possible makes our logic easier to read and understand. There are several level of raising and rescuing custom Exception types, passing the messages around that eventually make it back to the user. Consolidating our validation logic to one structure that more thoroughly checks for problems should make this code easier to work with.\n\n## Risks\n\n`YamlProcessor` on down through individual `Config::Entry` subclasses all use a system of raising, rescuing, and re-raising. To refactor any part of it risks breaking other parts. I propose we scope this refactor to Exception handling beginning with `Ci::YamlProcessor#initialize`, and following the call stack from processing a configuration file from there, replacing exceptions with returnable errors messages one layer at a time.\n\n## Involved components\n\n```\napp/controllers/projects/ci/lints_controller.rb\napp/models/ci/pipeline.rb\nlib/gitlab/ci/yaml_processor.rb\nlib/gitlab/ci/config.rb\nlib/gitlab/ci/config/extendable.rb\nlib/gitlab/ci/config/extendable/entry.rb\nlib/gitlab/ci/config/external/processor.rb\nlib/gitlab/config/loader/yaml.rb\n```\nPlus related specs.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-12T05:22:10.162Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T02:11:53.626Z","closed_at":"2020-09-02T09:49:37.328Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","maintenance::refactor","missed:13.3","pipeline processing","section::ops","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30066","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30066","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30066/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30066/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#30066","relative":"#30066","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#30066"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":24699580,"iid":30065,"project_id":278964,"title":"Prompt users to double check their account recovery settings","description":"We would like to empower users to better recover their own accounts, especially when 2FA is enabled.

Milestone with specific name blocks owners/users from accessing group milestone page","description":"**[HackerOne report #638731](https://hackerone.com/reports/638731)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-07-10, assigned to `estrike`:\n\n### Summary\n\nHello,\n\nThe project milestone with name `\u003cimg src=x onerror=prompt(1)\u003e` can throw `500` error on group milestone pages and can prevent group owners or users from accessing that page until they find the root cause of the issue.\n\nThe reason this happens is because project milestones are also rendered on group milestone page here at `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cGroupName\u003e/-/milestones`\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project milestone within a group named`\u003cimg src=x onerror=prompt(1)\u003e`   \n2. This will create a empty milestone.  \n3. Now as any user (or group owner) navigate to `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cGroupName\u003e/-/milestones`  \n4.They will see 500 error   \n![Screenshot_2019-07-10_at_13.28.32.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1c749a10-e879-4a4d-a30b-7e4d9bdb1043/Screenshot_2019-07-10_at_13.28.32.png)\n\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nProject Milestone with specific name block owners from accessing group milestone page\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nEither milestone should not allowed special characters like `\u003c` or group milestone page should be properly rendered.\n\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too.\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nThere are multiple impacts of this\n\n1. As mentioned earlier, this creates empty milestone which then prevent admin from deleting the milestone, or promoting at group level unless they specifically go to EDIT link directly and fix it.\n\n2. This blocks owners, maintainers from accessing the group milestone page till they find the root cause of the issue. Imagine some developer role creates such milestone (who has only project level access and not group level) and then prevent group owner, admin from accessing group milestones. This happens because project milestones too renders in group milestone page and group owners can see all the projects and their milestone which by default render in group milestone page irrespective of project visibility.\n\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [Screenshot_2019-07-10_at_13.28.32.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1c749a10-e879-4a4d-a30b-7e4d9bdb1043/Screenshot_2019-07-10_at_13.28.32.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-10T21:12:02.776Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T20:16:52.341Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T20:16:52.196Z","closed_by":{"id":590748,"username":"mdelaossa","name":"Mario de la Ossa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/590748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mdelaossa"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::4","security","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":590748,"username":"mdelaossa","name":"Mario de la Ossa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/590748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mdelaossa"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":590748,"username":"mdelaossa","name":"Mario de la Ossa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/590748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mdelaossa"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12769","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12769","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12769/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12769/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12769","relative":"#12769","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12769"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22679295,"iid":12766,"project_id":278964,"title":"Private subgroup path visible in epic timeline when child epic is added.","description":"**[HackerOne report #638516](https://hackerone.com/reports/638516)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-07-09, assigned to `akelly`:\n\n### Summary\n\nHello,\n\nWhen public group has private `sub group` inside it, none of the information should be visible publicly.\n\nHowever, if private sub group epic is added as a child epic to public group parent group, the timeline activity discloses the name of the private sub group.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

We aim to update each of these mirrors at least every 30 minutes. Additionally, we allow users to individually request an immediate update of their mirrors.\n\nWe are currently facing issues with Redis (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/7157) and with delays in pull mirroring specifically (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/7173).\n\nQuoting from the root-cause analysis in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/7173:\n\n\u003e Why? New mirrors were becoming \"ready to update\" at a higher rate than we were updating mirrors that were already ready to update\n\u003e Why? We were updating mirrors at a lower rate than our pullmirror nodes are capable of\n\u003e Why? There were too few RepositoryUpdateMirrorWorker jobs in the repository_update_mirror queue, leaving pullmirror nodes sitting idly by when they could be updating mirrors\n\u003e Why? UpdateAllMirrorsWorker couldn't schedule mirror updates fast enough to keep up with pullmirror nodes becoming ready for new work\n\u003e Why? The LPUSH Redis operation used to push new jobs onto the queue took significantly more time to complete than it would and has under healthier Redis conditions\n\nWe were *not able to schedule mirror updates fast enough* to keep up with mirrors becoming eligible for updates.\n\n#### Current design\n\nThere is an awesome deep-dive video over here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSZq0fpdY-Y\n\n![Screenshot_from_2019-07-10_16-26-26](/uploads/6e75e9346c040ffe6d2c4cac0d5cebbc/Screenshot_from_2019-07-10_16-26-26.png)\n\nWith the current implemention, there are 3 types of jobs:\n* [`UpdateAllMirrorsWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/ee/app/workers/update_all_mirrors_worker.rb)\n* [`ProjectImportScheduleWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/ee/app/workers/project_import_schedule_worker.rb)\n* `RepositoryUpdateMirrorWorker`\n\nSimplified, `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker` is a Sidekiq cronjob run every minute. It picks the next batch of jobs and enqueues them in Redis (`ProjectImportScheduleWorker` jobs). It waits until the current batch completed its jobs, effectively waiting for the slowest job of the batch to complete ([background](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14573#note_190458925)). It then re-schedules itself eagerly, so that the scheduling job is actually run at a higher frequency than every minute. This is because the minimum cronjob frequency for Sidekiq is one minute.\n\nThe `ProjectImportScheduleWorker` job basically creates a state machine record (`ProjectImportState`) to follow the job's execution. It then schedules another job of type `RepositoryUpdateMirrorWorker` which performs the actual work of updating mirrors.\n\nThe goal of `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker` is to always schedule enough jobs such that the Sidekiq workers always have something to work on. On the other hand, it tries to also minimize the queue length. This is because we need to be able to respond to the \"Update now!\" request from users and work on those jobs first.\n\nThe scheduling logic in `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker` is quite complex. I believe this is because of an impedance mismatch: On the worker side, we want to maximize resource utilization and always keep workers busy. However, there's no feedback loop when a job has finished. It is up to the cronjob-style scheduling job to determine whether or not new jobs should be enqueued. This is a batch-job which runs at fixed intervals, whereas we should be taken these decisions in a streaming fashion in order avoid unused resources.\n\nWith \u003e110k mirrors configured currently, we end up running \u003e220k sidekiq jobs plus the `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker` job per 30 minutes, translating to more than 120 sidekiq jobs per second.\n\n#### Abstract model\n\nWe have a large number (\u003e110k) of jobs we want to execute at least every 30 minutes. This translates to an average rate of about 60 jobs per second. In addition to regular scheduled updates, users may request immediate updates for individual repositories (\"Update now\").\n\nWe can model this as a priority queue `Q`: A job has a desired next execution timestamp. Jobs are being queued in order of said timestamp. A `pop(Q)` retrieves the next job to be executed and removes the job from the queue. Once the job has finished, it is rescheduled to run in 30 minutes and put back to the queue.\n\nWe employ `n` number of worker processes to consume from this queue and run jobs.\n\nThe goals for this model are:\n\n1. Retrieving the next job from the queue with `pop(Q)` needs to be efficient in `O(1)`\n1. In order to efficiently use resources, each of the `n` processes should always have work to do (unless the queue is empty).\n1. Ability to scale out to be able to provide updates to all mirrors every 30 minutes (or less).\n\n#### Proposed design\n\nThe proposal here is to not use sidekiq to handle those recurring jobs. Instead, we run `n` worker processes which consume from a Postgres-based queue implementation. There is no need for a centralized scheduler as those workers coordinate amongst themselves without much overhead.\n\n##### Queue implementation\n\nIn order to implement a queue in postgres, a `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` pattern can be used to efficiently implement `pop(Q)`. Let's illustrate with this example:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE jobs (id serial primary key, scheduled_for timestamp with time zone not null);\nCREATE INDEX ON jobs (scheduled_for, id);\n```\n\nJobs would reside in `jobs` table with a timestamp `scheduled_for`. After current time has passed this timestamp, the job is eligible to be executed.\n\nIn order to retrieve the next job (`pop(Q)`) from the queue, we do the following:\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSELECT * FROM jobs WHERE scheduled_for \u003c= NOW() ORDER BY scheduled_for, id LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED; \n-- execute job's work\nUPDATE jobs SET scheduled_for = NOW() + 30.minutes WHERE id = ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\nWith an index in place, retrieving the next job is in `O(1)` (or the number of currently executing jobs because we scan the index until we find the next record that hasn't been locked yet). More work needs to be done on the database-side when the job is rescheduled - this requires an index update in `O(log N)` (N: number of jobs) and an update to the record itself (which results in dead tuples).\n\nIn order to limit transaction length, the job's work should be done outside the transaction but I'll simplify over that for now.\n\nAfter the job has finished, we update the `scheduled_for` timestamp to the next desired execution timestamp, which effectively puts the job back into the queue.\n\n##### Worker efficiency, scaling out, robustness\n\nSince there's no batch scheduling anymore, a worker with free resources directly goes to the queue and picks the next pending job from it. Unless there are no pending jobs, there's never a time for a worker to sit idly and wait for a job to be scheduled.\n\nIn order to scale out, we'd add more worker processes. \n\n##### Update now, priorities\n\nThe \"Update now!\" functionality can be implemented by updating the `scheduled_for` timestamp and set that to the current time for the particular project. However, the concept can easily be extended to support priorities, too: Add a `priority integer` column and also add that to the index. `pop(Q)` now orders by `priority, scheduled_for, id`. By default, `priority` is 0. Any lower priority values would directly promote the job and it gets executed before all other jobs with lower priority.\n\n##### Discussion\n\n* No need for a explicit job to schedule mirror update jobs.\n* Strong consistency with respect to job status - no need to synchronize state across postgres and redis.\n* Reduced complexity for job handling/scheduling\n* It is easier to make sure we are using resources efficiently.\n* We would have to ship a mechanic to install a long-running process (runit) for the worker processes.\n\nFor small(er) installations, this still works the same way. When there are no pending mirror updates, the worker simply sleeps.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-10T15:52:58.211Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T08:54:46.186Z","closed_at":"2022-09-07T13:24:08.231Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii
