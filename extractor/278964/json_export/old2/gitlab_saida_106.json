The current filtering and sorting options provide quick ways to focus the list view on a subset of vulnerabilities for more efficient workflows. You can also see any vulnerabilities that have associated Issues or which subsequent scans indicate are resolved. This Activity column indicates at a glance which vulnerabilities might be ready to close out, which are in progress, and which ones might need some attention. However, this column was not one you could filter or sort on.!\n\nYou will now have even more control of your Vulnerability Report experience with the introduction of an Activity filter. Available in the Project, Group, and Security Center Vulnerability Reports, this new filter allows you to view vulnerabilities with Issues that are not yet resolved, that are resolved but have no associated Issues, that have Issues and are resolved, or that have no activity. The available filter options are mutually exclusive sets, allowing you to drill into precisely the vulnerability list view you need for any task.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/\n\n[Screen_Shot_2021-02-10_at_6.10.30_PM](/uploads/3903f5deedb3d1397874165abf798c83/Screen_Shot_2021-02-10_at_6.10.30_PM.png)\n\n## Design (from Figma)\nSee [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222447) and parent Epics for details.\n\n| Columns/Tooltips | Filter |\n| - | - |\n| ![image](/uploads/fbaae156ef03bdcbde0af2b9e6945fdd/image.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2020-09-11_at_9.30.07_AM](/uploads/d72f03327fb2c23ebcff6415b11b8d3d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-11_at_9.30.07_AM.png) |\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n\nTo keep this simple and moving forward, let's go with the following for now:\n\n* Selecting the `All` and `No activity` options will unselect all other options\n  * `All` effectively turns off this filter and displays all vulnerabilities according to the other filter values\n  * `No Activity` will only show vulnerabilities that do not have Issues and are still unresolved\n* Selecting `With issues` or `No longer detected` will unselect `All` or `No activity`.\n* You can select both `With issues` AND `No longer detected`. In this case, you will only see vulnerabilities that match both criteria.\n\nTo help distinguish that the Activity filter behaves differently from the other filters, we will change the checkmarks next to `With issues` and `No longer detected` to checkboxes (`All` and `No activity` will remain as checkmarks\\`). We can revisit the UX in a follow up issue after everyone is back from the holiday break.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [ ] ~frontend update the filters to add a filter for activity\n    - [x] Since these filters are static, I believe this involves just adding the filter to `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/helpers.js` and an update to the graphql query to filter by activity.\n    - [x] the GraphQL query has been updated to take two more parameters `hasIssues` and `hasResolution`\n    - [x] so the following filters should use the following parameters:\n        - `All`: `hasIssues` = `null` and `hasResolution` = `null`\n        - `No activity`: `hasIssues` = `false` and `hasResolution` = `false`\n        - `With issues`: `hasIssues` = `true` and `hasResolution` = `false`\n        - `No longer detected`: `hasIssues` = `false` and `hasResolution` = `true`\n    - [ ] treat the `No activity` filter like the `All` filter (i.e. if `No activity` is selected, all other options are unselected, if another selection is made, `No activity` is unselected)\n\nRelated to #230381","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-30T19:30:33.806Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T19:23:52.214Z","closed_at":"2021-02-16T20:33:22.090Z","closed_by":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","devops::secure","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::threat insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.5","missed:13.6","missed:13.7","release post item::in review","section::sec","security dashboard","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":2190515,"username":"KevSlashNull","name":"Kev","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f3861b3746ee5f779cbdcf1efa4a2a1e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/KevSlashNull"},{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"}],"author":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2190515,"username":"KevSlashNull","name":"Kev","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f3861b3746ee5f779cbdcf1efa4a2a1e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/KevSlashNull"},"user_notes_count":46,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259255","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":3},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259255","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259255/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259255/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#259255","relative":"#259255","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#259255"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3867,"epic":{"id":79234,"iid":3867,"title":"[MVC2] Restructure Group Security Dashboard: Vulnerability Report Updates","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3867","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71964819,"iid":259049,"project_id":278964,"title":"spec/controllers/projects/releases/evidences_controller_spec.rb:168 only passes on retries","description":"I believe the test at spec/controllers/projects/releases/evidences_controller_spec.rb:168 is broken, and only passes on retries.\n\n1.

This can be either on the [trial registration](https://gitlab.com/-/trial_registrations/new?glm_source=about.gitlab.com\u0026glm_content=free-trial) page or higher up, on the [free trial page](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/) of the marketing website.\nExample of reassurance:\n* Social validation: Leveraging our case study to demonstrate how companies improve their DevOps with GitLab, use quotes from GitLab users, pull content from [Is GitLab any good?](https://about.gitlab.com/is-it-any-good/). \n* Better emphasis on \"no credit card required\".\n* Better emphasis on the features that the trial offer and how valuable they are for some of our customers.\n\n## Solution Validation\n\nWe will validate the solution using A/B testing and monitoring any qualitative feedback that we can get from external sources or through the GitLab forum.  \n\n## Proposed design\n![Trial-register-desktop](/uploads/648460af5727ded11f2bb94b32dce4c2/Trial-register-desktop.jpg)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-30T09:47:12.632Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T11:46:53.549Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T13:48:02.102Z","closed_by":{"id":4412383,"username":"kcomoli","name":"Kevin Comoli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4412383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kcomoli"},"labels":["UX","UX Growth Team","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::growth","group::acquisition","section::growth","workflow::validation backlog"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4412383,"username":"kcomoli","name":"Kevin Comoli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4412383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kcomoli"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258987","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258987","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258987/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258987/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#258987","relative":"#258987","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#258987"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4881,"epic":{"id":142353,"iid":4881,"title":"[UX] Add reassurance to the trial flow.

They will not be deleted (even if expired) until newer artifacts are available.`. So, expired artifacts does not equal deleted artifacts.\n\n## Proposal\n\nShould expired artifacts be synced by Geo secondaries? They haven't been since 11.0, but it was to resolve failures when attempting to sync expired artifacts https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5357.\n\nWe could cause them to be synced by removing `not_expired` from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.4.1-ee/ee/app/models/ee/ci/job_artifact.rb#L80\n\n~~I assume this is safe since if/when they do get deleted from the primary, a delete event will occur and be processed by secondaries.~~ We probably need to fire more delete events from the primary e.g. from services that cause mass deletion of artifacts. =\u003e This is now covered by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297472\n\nI think this would make secondaries more accurate representations of the primary.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eThis is no longer relevant to this issue\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n**Update:** See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258918#note_484092073 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297472\n\n## A minor related problem\n\nIf the expiration is longer so the artifacts become synced, when artifacts do expire, they are not deleted, so no delete event is processed. The background workers on the secondary eventually discover the expired artifact and delete it (but they do not delete the file since delete jobs triggered by this process are not given the file path, and then the delete job just deletes the registry). If/when the artifact is deleted on the primary, the delete event happens but the way `FileRegistryRemovalService` is written, it exits without deleting the file if there is no registry.\n\nSummary: Artifacts become orphaned on secondaries after expiration.\n\nI don't want to create a separate issue yet for this problem since it would be resolved by removing the `not_expired` scope.\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-30T01:03:41.161Z","updated_at":"2021-02-13T04:03:14.970Z","closed_at":"2021-02-13T04:03:14.927Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","devops::systems","group::geo","section::enablement","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258918","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258918","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258918/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258918/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#258918","relative":"#258918","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#258918"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3574,"epic":{"id":67504,"iid":3574,"title":"🚨 Disaster Recovery complete maturity","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3574","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71904953,"iid":258842,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add sorting to security dashboard column: Identifier","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.

Users [would like it to be](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249803#type-of-work-is-not-super-useful-for-providing-actionable-insights).\n\n### Proposal\n\n\n1.  On group-level VSA, the \"Type of Work\" chart will inherit the `filters` from the filter bar (like they apply to the stage data at the top of the page).  \n1. The chart will also inherit the `date_range` for the top VSA filter bar.\n2. Remove the label filtering for the type of work chart.\n3. Leaving only the `Show` option of choosing: ``issues`` / ``merge requests``.\n4. When there are no labels selected in the filter bar, display the top 10 labels by default (current behavior).\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-04-06_at_15.08.56](/uploads/fb8a6458353d818c54e64024b8553f3f/Screen_Shot_2022-04-06_at_15.08.56.png)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Select these labels in the filter bar: ~\"type::bug\" ~\"type::feature\" ~\"type::maintenance\". \n2. The chart will shows a cumulative count of issues and merge requests breakdown to bugs, features and maintenance.  \n\n### Future steps\n\nIn the future, we need to save filter sets so users can switch between them easily. We can have 3 predefined filters:\n\n1. Type labels - bug/feature/debt breakdown\n1. Priority labels\n2. Group labels\n\n### Related links\n\n- [Next Prioritization Working Group - Taxonomy: Work types\n](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TDswR4h-Zo-Fdq3yVtk-q-uJrKe_03iF9jB1XQWqQb4/edit#slide=id.g123cae89002_0_19)\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217943#note_346421179\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222449#note_361637084\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249803#type-of-work-is-not-super-useful-for-providing-actionable-insights\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349793","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-29T17:24:18.736Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T04:41:38.398Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T07:39:00.874Z","closed_by":{"id":3397881,"username":"ekigbo","name":"Ezekiel Kigbo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3397881/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ekigbo"},"labels":["Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","SUS::Impacting","UX","UX debt","devops::manage","documentation","frontend","group::optimize","priority::3","release post item::in review","section::dev","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":3397881,"username":"ekigbo","name":"Ezekiel Kigbo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3397881/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ekigbo"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3397881,"username":"ekigbo","name":"Ezekiel Kigbo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3397881/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ekigbo"},"user_notes_count":55,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258680","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258680","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258680/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258680/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#258680","relative":"#258680","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#258680"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7961,"epic":{"id":511212,"iid":7961,"title":"VSA as GitLab's analytics hub - Viable maturity","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7961","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71882930,"iid":258663,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add Webhook when Releases are Updated","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nPeople also want to receive webhooks when releases are updated\n\n### Proposal \n\nExtend the webhooks for Releases to include updated events","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-29T15:36:47.727Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T15:04:23.077Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T18:59:48.332Z","closed_by":{"id":5622641,"username":"nicolewilliams","name":"Nicole Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5622641/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolewilliams"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::release","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Update the sorting method to sort vulnerabilities in dependencies first.\n\n## Example project\n\nhttps://staging.gitlab.com/secure-team-test/dependency-list-test/-/dependencies","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-29T14:22:21.942Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T19:37:24.627Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T01:45:48.553Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","dependency list","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","missed:14.0","priority::2","release post item","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258648","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258648","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258648/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/258648/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#258648","relative":"#258648","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#258648"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":71875423,"iid":258638,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Enable `View the environment that generated the alert`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:expose_environment_path_in_alert_details` feature flag\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: @gitlab-org/ci-cd/progressive-delivery \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_progressive-delivery`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @agulina \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen the Feature Flag is remove, the Environment Path will be available and visible in the Alert Details.

counter in the “Commits” tab of a merge request is not updated at the same time as the list. In one research session, a participant saw 6 commits listed in that tab, but the tab counter said “5”.\n\n![image](/uploads/f45dfe23ffa8f4babc6a5db5b4ca08bc/image.png)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Edit a file in an MR and commit your changes\n1. Come back to the MR and notice that the Commits tab counter has not increased\n1.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nAn additional search term is no longer needed when searching for a particular filename. \n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a developer, when I apply the filename filter, e.g. “filename:\u0026ast;.proto” a search will appear to execute successfully and no results will be returned. When I add in a “\u0026ast;” and execute the query, results will be successfully returned. I think that the first query should return results, or should at least give some indication that it’s an invalid query. \n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\nDevelopers and any people that search for specific files. \n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to search just by filename without adding in a wildcard search. Or, the user should be alerted that a search with just a filter is invalid. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nFiletype filters should assume a wildcard search for the contents of no additional query terms are supplied. \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nIt would give a less confusing search experience. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\nI don’t believe this should have a security impact. \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones

Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-28T14:27:26.512Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T20:05:50.179Z","closed_at":"2020-10-12T05:02:53.968Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/257878","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/257878","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/257878/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/257878/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#257878","relative":"#257878","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#257878"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4491,"epic":{"id":117314,"iid":4491,"title":"Optional admin approval for local user sign up","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4491","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71804433,"iid":257874,"project_id":278964,"title":"Limit reindexing concurrency","description":"We aim to start a cronjob for `rake gitlab:db:reindex` once every hour.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently the usage ping only [reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage_data.rb#L137) the total number of packages present within the system.\n\nWe could have better insights if we have this count broken down [package types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/packages/package.rb#L49). For example, when implementing an MVC for a feature that is linked to a package type, these counts could indicate which package type should we start with.\n\nAs a reminder, Usage Ping collects statistics for ~\"gitlab.com\" *and* ~\"self-managed\" (if usage ping was not disabled) which is always better than Snowplow events that only accounts for ~\"gitlab.com\" \n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Document that when adding a new package type, their count should be included in Usage Ping\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group.

for ways to reduce the number of SQL queries.\n\nAlso see this comment from `@alexkalderimis`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44662#note_426534106 as something to perhaps explore.\n\n### Backlog Refinement Notes\n\nthe aim is to improve performance rather than eliminate all problems (`Notes::CopyService` has been in the wild for a while now, refactored from code that was essentially the same, so any issues are not new) and we could focus on the low-hanging fruit.\n\nIf we discover more complicated problems (that are important to address) we could generate issues for them.\n\nLooking at the queries in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41714#note_419395864 it does seem like some of it is N+1 queries, so I agree with Luke to focus on that in

Then we can do comparisons with the already-present `created_at` timestamp column in the `experiment_users` table to see how long it took from when the user initially joined the experiment to when they performed the desired conversion event.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-25T19:36:48.633Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T21:56:12.319Z","closed_at":"2020-12-02T21:56:12.246Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"labels":["database","devops::growth","group::acquisition","growth experiment","milestone::p3","section::growth"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"}],"author":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255979","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/255979","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/255979/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/255979/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#255979","relative":"#255979","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#255979"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4481,"epic":{"id":115881,"iid":4481,"title":"Record Experiment Data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4481","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71706933,"iid":255978,"project_id":278964,"title":"Undesirable effect of \"Skip outdated deployment jobs\" CI feature on manual jobs + related stages","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n[Customer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001in3W2QAI) raised a [ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/173413) (internal links) because there were getting slack notifications for deployment jobs failing. \n\nThe jobs were failing in historic pipelines, and related to deployments that were never run.\n\nCustomer uses manual deployment jobs.\n\nInvestigation showed that, depending on how pipeline was configured, the effect of leaving this feature enabled (which is the default) can put historic pipelines into some odd states.\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs) for skip outdated deployment jobs state \"The pending deployment jobs will be skipped.\" - this doesn't happen in the case of manual jobs.  Mostly, manual jobs cease to be undeployed manual jobs, and are switched to a failed state, and the stages in the pipeline can switch from blocked or manual to running or failed.\n\nHowever, there's a number of outcomes possible, as shown in the examples, potentially all within the same pipeline.\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\n### Workaround\n\n[Disable skip outdated deployment jobs on the project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs)\n\nSet ~\"severity::3\"  \n\n### Steps to reproduce / Example Project\n\nExample CI attached along with screenshots below.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nManual jobs are set failed, stages in pipelines get switched to 'running' (or maybe 'pending' states) - the treatment can vary for environments in the same pipeline; eg: see example 3.\n\nThe purpose of this feature seems to prevent multiple live pipelines deploying to the same environment in the wrong order. If an earlier pipeline tries to deploy old code to an environment, it should get skipped.\n\nThis doesn't really apply to manual jobs.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nEither don't change manual jobs, or set them skipped.\nSkipped also removes the play button, reducing the chance of accidental deployment.\n\nSee example 3 for a CI config where 1/3 manual deploy jobs are left undeployed, 1/3 set failed, and 1/3 set skipped.  So this feature does sometimes set manual jobs skipped.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n* The example CI only runs deployments after a merge request.\n* In each example, changes to the project are made twice, and merged, triggering the full CI config twice.\n* The first time, no deployments are run, for example:\n\n![image](/uploads/5d770f92f561e9fd8e9960ffadd076c9/image.png)\n\n* The second time, all deployments are run, eg:\n\n![image](/uploads/68bd5e5d5db786b3e4b952c0a02afe23/image.png)\n\n* This issue relates to what happens as a result to the earlier pipeline.\n\n* The status of the first pipeline is shown in both its original state, and the revised state after the subsequent deployment.\n\n#### example 1\n\n* [gitlab-ci.yml](/uploads/a55b1b4dd72cb185028d486b500394d3/gitlab-ci.yml)\n* Summary before: ![image](/uploads/e3134b5ac7b7a430e1c8733b56cf3a82/image.png) after: ![image](/uploads/54e57da631cc07f7579f3bc367c29b98/image.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ebefore/after detail\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- initial deployment\n\n![image](/uploads/471c8d1dd439ca6563cbed725bf279a1/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/5d770f92f561e9fd8e9960ffadd076c9/image.png)\n\n- after subsequent deployment\n\n![image](/uploads/85958981dfcab850046b72ba6cab43e1/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/043137b2b6a6bffbf237f58bf0648a30/image.png)\n\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### example 2\n\n* [gitlab-ci.yml](/uploads/97dfbd35a6bdbd01dd25c3770b3d5834/gitlab-ci.yml)\n* Summary before: ![image](/uploads/0bca06bb9ba634eee78e42daf1f86b57/image.png) after: ![image](/uploads/ff4bfbf49bbc30351cd6208c1dacb270/image.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ebefore/after detail\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- initial deployment\n\n![image](/uploads/af97b244199f3af5ddf67acfc67410c8/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/66d32186d2a981a25a00489da516a901/image.png)\n\n- after subsequent deployment\n\n![image](/uploads/2942543d8557c45098338f0e0d8f1611/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/c692cf5b437809fd6ecb656be9caac39/image.png)\n\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Example 3\n\nThis was from earlier in the testing, before the test case was simplified.\n\nThis produces an outcome where one of the deploy jobs is skipped, then the stage goes into 'pending' because there's another job in that stage that would normally run once the previous stage is deployed.\n\n* ci [gitlab-ci.yml](/uploads/ecae349bc2b8da40f5d81534b5bf9c6c/gitlab-ci.yml)\n* Summary before: ![image](/uploads/15b5e398f269887461996d3567ee1091/image.png) after: ![image](/uploads/071541bbf077a91e734ba47e83f8b0d2/image.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ebefore/after detail\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- initial deployment\n\n![image](/uploads/05feed1eabe649084e1c51e91fcf7572/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/0587ec1e0fff5cc61372ded843cc1c57/image.png)\n\n- after subsequent deployment\n\n![image](/uploads/c7479417985205eda4c8c1d406e0b0f8/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/4c8b603b9d9dab984a8974e986d4af59/image.png)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### failed job status\n\nTo complete the account of what happens, the job page displays the following:\n\n![image](/uploads/64610234d02f165f427f775d0249a7c3/image.png)\n\nFull text so it's searchable:\n\n```\nThe deployment job is older than the previously succeeded deployment job, and therefore cannot be run\nThe deployment of this job to stg did not succeed.\n```\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n- Customer reported issue on gitlab.com;  13.5.0-pre 417adc72d64\n- Reproduced on 13.3.5 self managed\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-25T19:29:50.022Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T10:46:13.452Z","closed_at":"2022-05-24T10:11:29.690Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","Next Up","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","cicd::active","customer","devops::release","group::release","missed:13.6","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

To do so, follow these steps:\n\n* [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n  * [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n  * [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n* [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package. If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1), the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n  * [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n* [x] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n  * [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n* [x] Close the feature issue to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n* [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n* [x] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n  * [x] Set the title to \"\\[Feature flag\\] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n  * [x] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n  * [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n  * [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag. For example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you remove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back to the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent matters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release), the [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n* [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n  * [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n  * [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n  * [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n* [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package. If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1), the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n  * [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n* [ ] Close the feature issue to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n* [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n  * [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n* [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n* [x] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-25T09:53:44.140Z","updated_at":"2023-01-01T08:01:30.774Z","closed_at":"2022-11-25T04:46:42.281Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","feature flag","frontend","group::editor","priority::4","section::dev","severity::4","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"}],"author":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255919","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":50,"completed_count":33},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"33 of 50 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/255919","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/255919/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/255919/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#255919","relative":"#255919","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#255919"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71674893,"iid":255915,"project_id":278964,"title":"Persist Swimlane Setting","description":"As part of \u00263352 we need to persist the user's choice of grouping on a specific board.\n\nCurrently this is limited to epics (for epic swimlanes).

The input box for the second comment renders *behind* the pending comment already on that line. Switching to the \"side-by-side\" diff view allows for adding the second comment. However, once the second comment is added to the review, it then renders its pending comment *on top of* the original pending comment for that line, making it impossible to edit the first comment later on in the review.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open a merge request's changes in the \"inline\" diff view.\n1. Write a comment for a changed line and click \"Start a review\".\n1. Click the comment bubble on the same line number to attempt to add a second comment for that line.\n1. Observe that no input box is visible.\n\n### Example Project\n\nThe behavior happens in the Gitlab project: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab ([Test MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43357/diffs?view=inline))\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIn the \"inline\" diff view, the input box for a second comment renders *behind* the pending comment already on that line.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe input box should render *above* the pending comment already on that line.\n\n### Relevant info and screenshots\n\nFirst screenshot below shows the state immediately after clicking the comment bubble to add a second comment to line 263, which already has a pending comment. Notice the thin white line directly above the yellow-shaded pending comment. That thin white line is the input box rendering behind the original pending comment.\n\n![image](/uploads/2fbb3a38851979cae14bbbeffa9761e8/image.png)\n\n---\n\nSecond screenshot below shows the same state as above, but in the \"side-by-side\" diff view.

User arrives on the “select your namespace” step of the “start a trial” flow (i.e. `/-/trails/select`)\n   - We know who this user is (i.e. we have a `user` record and can store their unique \u0026 constant `user.id` value) because they had to sign in or register to get this far\n   - We immediately record them as being part of the experiment; that is to say, we insert a new row into the `experiment_users` table:\n     \n     | `id` | `experiment_id` | `user_id` | `group_type` | `converted`   |\n     |------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|\n     | `38` | `4`             | `10872`   | `1` (experimental) | `FALSE` |\n     \n     - Notice that we mark them as not having converted (because they really haven’t done anything yet, they’re just part of the experiment so far)\n1. At any point in the future (it doesn’t have to be during this request or session, it doesn’t have to be in the same browser or on the same device) the user follows through with picking a namespace and starting their trial (by clicking on the “Start your free trial” button with a valid namespace selected)\n   - As soon as that happens, we update their same row in the `experiment_users` table to specify that they have converted\n\n     | `id` | `experiment_id` | `user_id` | `group_type` | `converted`  |\n     |------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n     | `38` | `4`             | `10872`   | `1` (experimental) | `TRUE` |\n\n1.

catastrophes","description":"### Update 11 Aug 2021:\nDev for this is complete, the remaining work is this production change request to enable the setting by default on the Gitlab.com instance: gitlab-com/gl-infra/production#5323\n\n----\n### Problem to solve\n\nProjects can contain a huge amount of valuable data.  Currently they can be deleted instantly.  If deletion is the result of a mistake or a bug (like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40353), it can be catastrophic.\n\n### Proposal\n\nTurn on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cascading_settings.html at the instance level and lock it. Provide mechanisms for project owners to immediately delete projects scheduled for deletion. Allow for the immediate re-use of paths from projects that are scheduled for delayed deletion. As a bonus, explore allowing subgroups to specify the duration of the deletion period (maybe so long as it is longer than the default setting at from the parent group/instance).\n\nOld proposal:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nHard deletion of *all* projects should be preceded by a period of delayed deletion, where the project is no longer visible to users but [can be restored by admins](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37014).\n\nThis is different from, but would rely on the same functionality as, the [delayed deletion setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223013).  This would be followed by implementing [similar functionality for groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241146).\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n\n- [x] #191367 : Support the ability to immediately delete a project scheduled for delayed deletion by navigating to `Project \u003e Settings \u003e Projects` and double confirming hard deletion\n- [x] Enable the setting by default for newly created top-level namespaces.\n- [x] Add instance setting for delayed deletion (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67230)\n- [x] Ensure instance admins can restore any project within the instance that is scheduled for delayed-deletion.\n- [x] Add support for Premium+ Groups to override the default delayed period set at the instance level. Subgroups should look to their nearest ancestor to get the default setting. Consider leveraging the existing work being down to cascade settings in a consistent manner (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/291082)\n\nPossible follow-ups / enhancements:\n\n- [x] #329538 : Enable re-use of Project paths when a project is deleted (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255449#note_499630633)\n\n### GitLab.com Rollout Steps\n\n- [x] Ensure that [the relevant docs section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#enable-delayed-project-removal) is updated.\n- [x] Let the Support team know when it happens via `#support_gitlab-com` and additional details like if it's behind a feature flag, it's part of the feature flag process/template, so no additional steps are needed.\n\n\n### Release Post Notes\n\nUp until now, [delayed project deletion](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#enable-delayed-project-removal) has been disabled by default on GitLab.com because there has been no way to immediately delete a project when necessary. In this release, we've added an instance setting to enable delayed deletion by default for all new projects. We've also added the ability for projects scheduled for delayed deletion to be immediately, permanently removed. Delayed project deletion is now enabled by default for GitLab.com and leverages our [cascading settings framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cascading_settings.html) so groups can freely opt out of the default behavior if so desired.

the dependent issue (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251113) has been completed, this issue is to track the development of the Rails controllers to create, edit and assign compliance frameworks to groups.\n\n## To do\n\n- Create GraphQL queries to allow the following at the root-group level:\n  - [x] List all compliance frameworks for a namespace - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47779\n  - [x] Introduce compliance framework creation service - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47909\n  - [x] Delete compliance labels - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48912\n  - [ ] ~~Filter a namespace's list of compliance frameworks by a single ID~~ - Separate issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/289846\n  - [x] Create group-level compliance labels - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48250 (In Maintainer Review)\n  - [x] Ability to update an existing compliance framework - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49157\n  - ~~Assign them to projects~~ (Moved to [separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276221))\n\n:bulb: The engineer working on this may want to consider splitting this in to 3 MRs, depending on their preference.\n\nThe form for Compliance Framework Labels should have the following fields:\n\n* **Title:** \\[ e.g. HIPAA, SOX, Internal, Tech Risk, otherCustomLabelName \\]\n  * The labels should allow the use of labels that *look* scoped (use of `::`) but should not implement or leverage any scoped label behavior for now.\n* **Description:** \\[ e.g. \"This label should be applied to projects which are regulated by `HIPAA`\" \\]\n* **Background color:** \n\n## Out of scope:\n\n- [Enforcement / \"regulated\" toggle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220190)\n- Force Merge (under ~\"workflow::solution validation\")\n\n## Mockups\n\n|Settings

Title suggestion: [Experiment Name] Successful Cleanup --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to clean up the experiment code from the [new user onboarding experiment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224515). The experiment was successful therefore we should roll out the experiment as a permanent change the user experience when signing up for a GitLab.com account.\n\n## Steps\n\n- [x] Determine whether the feature should apply to SaaS and/or self-managed\n- [x] Determine whether the feature should apply to EE - and which tiers - and/or Core\n- [x] Determine if tracking should be kept as is, removed, or modified.\n- [x] Migrate experiment to a default enabled [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/development.html) for one milestone and add a changelog. Converting to a feature flag can be skipped at the ICs discretion if risk is deemed low with consideration to both SaaS and (if applicable) self managed.\n- [ ] Ensure any relevant documentation has been updated.\n- [ ] In the next milestone, [remove the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up).\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature/experiment feature flags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Merge Requests\n\n*

[comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42763#note_417386218), it seemed like adding more than a happy path spec would be a bit overkill here :upside_down_face: but please let

Thanks for adding the spec :bow: It looks good!\n\u003e \n\u003e **Non-blocking** I'd love to see a spec which cover the `nil` branch (if the job is not found) because self-managed instances might have persistent Redis.\n\u003e \n\u003e Personally, I am huge fan of [Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) (e.g. https://github.com/mbj/mutant) which probably would have
