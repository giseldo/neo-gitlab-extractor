[{"id":30643198,"iid":204998,"project_id":278964,"title":"Discussion issue for \"Lint code in the Web IDE and provide actionable data for resolution\"","description":"This issue is related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/5428\n\nWe identified four ways to implement this:\n\n### Option 1\n\nOne global pipeline running always, and using a custom image with rubocop and eslint installed, that would accept requests for every project. I have two concerns about this approach. The first one is about scalability. I don’t think one pipeline can hold all requests coming from every instance of the web IDE. We would need some sort of Kubernetes pod that can spin up other containers based on some hw and network parameters. The other concern is security. We will be sending information of all projects to the same container. There could be some sort of breach that could leak private information. Nevertheless, from the overall perspective, this is the more reasonable approach because there is no waiting time for the pipeline to start and because we save runner minutes. This option wouldn't involve modifying the `.gitlab-webide.yml` file.\n\n### Option 2\nThe second option is to run, automatically, a pipeline every time an instance of the web IDE loads. Since we can have many different kinds of projects me might be wasting runner minutes if the project language is, for example, python. Therefore, I suppose we should let the user opt-in for this feature inside the `.gitlab-webide.yml` file.\n  * There can be some optimizations here like, instead of spinning up a pipeline every time an instance of the web IDE loads, we can reuse the same linting pipeline for all instances that belongs to the same project.\n  * The problem with this approach would be to keep the pipeline running while there is at least one instance of the web IDE running and, at the same time, stop the pipeline once there is no more web IDE instances of that project opened.\n\n### Option 3\nThe third option would be to run the linting inside the web IDE terminal. This will require two things:\n  * The image defined in the `.gitlab-webide.yml` should have `rubocop` and `eslint` installed. This is more painful for users.\n  * The user has to click on the web ide terminal to start the linting.\n  * The problem for this approach as well would be that we depend on the web IDE terminal life cycle to have linting. If, at some point, the web IDE terminal life cycle differs from the linting one, we will have to reimplement all the logic.\n\n### Option 4\nThe fourth option would be a similar approach that we took for CI linting. This will involve creating an API endpoint for linting. Once we receive the request we can call the local binaries `rubocop` and `eslint` to parse the content in the request. This can affect global server performance since they can be accepting a lot of requests.\n\nEach option has its pros and cons.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-11T18:39:32.657Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T13:34:08.548Z","closed_at":"2020-05-28T14:44:52.545Z","closed_by":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","backend","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","type::feature","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Roadmap view by set dates instead of infinite horizontal scrolling [Iteration 1]","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003e Parker: When reporting on my team's progress, I want to view my team's planned work from from a high level down to a very granular view so that I can craft the right view for the right audience.\n\nPer discussions in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6802 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12887, to resolve current performance issues and concerns we should limit the Roadmap view to a set of Dates provided by the user, rather than an infinite scrolling timeline showing all epics and milestones.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduce scrolling interactions when possible\n- Reduce loading times on scroll\n- Reduce number of extraneous epics loaded into roadmap\n\n### MVC solution\n\n###### Add a datepicker with 3 options (for MVC):\n- This quarter (the current fiscal quarter the user is in) **This is the default option.**\n- This year (the current year the user is in)\n- Within 3 years (today's date - 1.5 years and + 1.5 years)\n\n| Date picker | Default view |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| \u003cimg

options\n- When the time range is `This quarter`, the roadmap is segmented by `Weeks` and there is no other option available for MVC\n- When the time range is `This year`, the views available are `Months` and `Weeks`\n- When the time range is `Within 3 years` the views available are `Quarters` `Months`, and `Weeks`\n\n![Ranges](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/cf6c22a7a4ae5f7e9a471d3b3f017c3d/Ranges.png)\n\n###### Available views by resolution\n- For MVC, there are 6 ways the user can segment

Having many commits in a merge request makes it easier to browse history of changes, makes it easier to use `git blame`, makes it easier to understand how the codebase evolves.\n\n\u003e I would rather have a merge request with 500 LoC changed and 50 commits than a merge request with 500 LoC and 5 commits if commits are not describing the evolution of the code in a merge request.\n\n@grzesiek from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/22099#note_285247474\n\n\u003e I believe that this change has an opposite effect than improving engineering productivity:\n\n@rymai from https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1581330844352600?thread_ts=1581329139.348000\u0026cid=C02PF508L\n\n\u003e Ok, I don’t see where we say that this rule increase productivity, but I hear your feedback.\n\n@marin from https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1581330857352800?thread_ts=1581329139.348000\u0026cid=C02PF508L\n\n\u003e And digging through really bad commit messages, and 10s of commits when trying to debug the application does? I don't think I would agree that googling how git works is not productive.\n\n@grzesiek from https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1581331591354400?thread_ts=1581329139.348000\u0026cid=C02PF508L\n\n\u003e I would rather ask Maintainers to review commits and coach people than place arbitrary limits on the amount of commits per merge request, what, in my opinion, does not improve the situation\n\n@marin from https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1581331448354000?thread_ts=1581329139.348000\u0026cid=C02PF508L\n\n\u003e It is a problem of quality of commits. However, it takes way longer to teach someone how to write a good commit than your example of googling for how git works. While 10 commit limit is not perfect, it at least tries to enforce a \"stop-and-think\" policy that is slowly showing folks how to work better. \n\n@marin from https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1581411445388800?thread_ts=1581329139.348000\u0026cid=C02PF508L\n\n\u003e I think all of the folks discussing here are forgetting one thing: We are dealing with scale here. \n\n\u003e I will invite folks to help out during our incident calls to debug what sort of stuff our application does, to paint a picture on how hard it is to go through hundreds of commits that are difficult to decipher. While teaching people is great, I have not seen a single person taking action to do so nor I've seen any interest in people improving themselves.\n\n@dcroft from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/22099#note_285773994\n\n\u003e How are we planning on measuring the impact of this change?\n\n@yorickpeterse from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/22099#note_285825933\n\n\u003e While the limit is arbitrary, I believe we originally settled on 10 since this was the Git fetch depth (which IIRC at the time was 10, now it seems to be 20). If you have more commits than are fetched, Danger (or other tools) is not able to verify those commits. If the depth setting is exposed using an environment variable, we could limit to at least that.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nIf we want to lift this limit, we should:\n\n1. Make sure we know what alternative solutions there are\n1. Create issues to implement these solutions\n1. Implement them\n1. Lift the limit\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-11T15:39:59.174Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:03:00.481Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T13:42:28.103Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas

This allows us to toggle specific features based on the registry type.\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Implementation\nThere are 4 required steps to determine if a self-managed instance is using an external container registry.\n\n1. Update the [Container Registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html) to respond to `GET /v2` requests with two additional headers:\n\n* `Gitlab-Container-Registry-Version`: The semantic version of the GitLab Container Registry (e.g. `2.9.0-gitlab`);\n* `Gitlab-Container-Registry-Features`: A comma separated list of extensions/features that are not part of the Docker Distribution spec (e.g. `tag_delete,...`).\n\nThe HTTP response from a third-party Container Registry to `GET /v2/` looks like:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 20\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nDate: Thu, 30 Apr 2020 08:50:01 GMT\nDocker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0\n```\n\nAnd the response from the GitLab Container Registry looks like:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 20\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nDate: Thu, 30 Apr 2020 08:50:01 GMT\nDocker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0\nGitlab-Container-Registry-Version: 2.9.0-gitlab\nGitlab-Container-Registry-Features: tag_delete\n```\n\n2. Add a new rake task to Rails that will query this API route and register wether the container registry is the GitLab one (response contains the `Gitlab-*` headers) or a third-party (no `Gitlab-*` headers) and save the result to the database.\n3. Omnibus can then call this rake task whenever a self-managed instance is reconfigured: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214251\n4. Measure and track this configuration across all available GitLab instances: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199193\n\n#### Database updates\n\nAdd 3 new columns to the `application_settings` database table:\n\n| name | type | description |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| `container_registry_vendor` |  `text`  | Possible values of `gitlab` and `other`. If the registry responds to an `GET /v2/` request with headers like `Gitlab-.*`, then we set this to `gitlab`, otherwise it's `other`. It's worth to make this a `text` field because in future we may want to determine the type of some third-party registries as well. So we can expand `other` with specific vendors like e.g. `amazon`. |\n| `container_registry_version` | `text` | This is the content of the `Gitlab-Container-Registry-Version` header from a `GET /v2/` response (semantic version). | \n| `container_registry_features` | `array` | This is a list of features supported by the registry. It should be set to the content of the `Gitlab-Container-Registry-Features` header from a `GET /v2/` request. Example: `[:tag_delete]`. |\n\n#### Testing with the Container Registry\n\nThe GitLab Container Registry has already been updated to reply with the additional headers. This change will be released in 13.0. Meanwhile, to develop/test the GitLab change, one can use the `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry:v2.9.1-gitlab-pre` image.\n\n1. Setup a GDK instance ([instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/master/doc/set-up-gdk.md)) with the Container Registry integration ([instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/master/doc/howto/registry.md));\n\n1. No changes are required to test the behavior when using a third-party registry. Versions prior to the unreleased `v2.9.1` will not include the new headers on the response to `GET /v2/`. Therefore, testing with the current `v2.9.0` or any version before that will replicate the behavior of third-party registries.\n\n1. To test the change with the new GitLab Container Registry headers, change the image that your GDK is using to spin the registry container:\n\n    ```shell\n    cd \u003cyour GDK root, not the GitLab app root\u003e\n    echo registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry:v2.9.1-gitlab-pre \u003e registry_image\n    gdk reconfigure\n    gdk restart\n    ```\n\n    Confirm that you're using the correct image:\n\n    ```\n    $ docker ps\n    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                 ...\n    6b1522686d27        registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry:v2.9.1-gitlab-pre   ...\n    ```\n\n    Try to invoke the registry API with `curl -i localhost:5000/v2/`. You should see a response with the new headers. You can now test the GitLab change.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this change\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

update the member attributes\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to the members page of a group or of a project.\r\n2. For an existing member in the group/project, try changing the expiry date of the member.\r\n\r\n### Example Project\r\n\r\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\r\n\r\nTwo requests are fired consecutively to the same endpoint for this single change. This can be noticed in the `Network` tab in the browser.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\r\n\r\nThis should only fire a single request ideally.\r\n\r\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\r\n\r\nThe first request is a `POST` request with `access_level` and `expires_at`, and the second is PATCH with just `:access_level` as param. The latter seems unnecessary for a change in expiry.\r\n\r\nThe endpoint (in case of group members) is: `groups/:group_name/-/group_members/:member_id`\r\n\r\n### Side effects.\r\n\r\nBecause 2 calls are being made to this endpoint, 2 updates are processed in the backend for the same member and this leads to 2 audit event records being created for a single action performed by the user.\r\n\r\n### Output of checks\r\n\r\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\r\n\r\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\r\n\r\n\r\n### Possible fixes","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-11T03:47:14.407Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T22:03:26.076Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T09:35:02.699Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::manage","frontend","group::compliance","missed-deliverable","missed:12.9","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"}],"author":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/204809","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/204809","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/204809/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/204809/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#204809","relative":"#204809","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#204809"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30608639,"iid":204803,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Scope merge request approval rules to protected branches using API search\"","description":"The following discussion from !24344 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @pedroms started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24344#note_285833167):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e @sming-gitlab do you know why is the modal wider than usual?

This way we have some process for *ensuring* eventual consistency of registry tables with a high degree of confidence. Events are fast, but relatively less robust.\n\n- [ ] Also remove the `Remove entry` button from the UI since this handles it automatically\n\n### Unresolved questions\n\n- If `RegistryConsistencyWorker` comes across a registry that does not have a corresponding model record because the model record was deleted, we don't know where the file is in order to delete it. Maybe an event will later delete the file and registry-- or maybe that job was lost. I've been thinking maybe we should store file location information on registries so we don't have to derive it from the read-replica DB + the codebase. Data should not just move around, so the duplication of information seems safe. If primary data *does* move around, then at least we have a shot at moving/removing the old data in this case. Without storing the information, there is much more risk of orphaning data with little to no recourse.\n- Is it correct to remove files from object storage when `sync_object_storage` becomes disabled? It feels like we could get into a weird situation in this case.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-11T00:46:27.793Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T03:24:34.189Z","closed_at":"2020-06-04T17:42:08.341Z","closed_by":{"id":660180,"username":"toon","name":"Toon

Common Go Library","description":"## Summary\n\nDAST no longer relies on the [common library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/) to generate its reports, and DAST-specific code should be removed from [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/).\n\n## Further details\n\nThese should be removed from the common library:\n- `zap_plugin_id` identifier type\n- `vulnerabilities[].location.site_area` key\n- top-level keys `scanned_urls`, `io_error_urls`, and `target_url`\n\nThe `wasc` identifier type should not be removed because it's generic and could be used by some analyzer projects.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/merge_requests/39\n\nThere is no need to upgrade the common library in the Go projects depending on it, but we need to make sure these projects still compile.\n\n## Improvements\n\nThe goal is simply to reduce the complexity of the `common` library, and clearly communicate it's no longer used by DAST.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe should be careful not to remove code that is used by the analyzer projects of SAST, Dependency Scanning or Container Scanning,

Insecurely, by using the [REGISTRY_INSECURE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#available-variables) environment variable\n1. Securely, which requires a valid SSL certificate\n\nHowever, if a client wants to use a self-signed SSL certificate, container scanning will not work properly.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nThis change will make container scanning more flexible for self hosted and air-gapped instances\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn order to allow the use of self-signed certificates, we need to make the following changes:\n\n1.

you call your branch the same name as a git hash, it could be checked out by dependents","description":"**[HackerOne report #790634](https://hackerone.com/reports/790634)** by `retroplasma` on 2020-02-07, assigned to @dcouture:\n\n### Summary\n\nIf we call a branch the same name like a git hash then the moment it's checked out somewhere, git prefers the branch name.  \nSo let's say the git hash is `e91803d442559d6efb63102b10c919e10901b01d`.  \nAnd someone referenced that hash in their program.  \nNow the developer or a hacker with access to the repo can create a branch named `e91803d442559d6efb63102b10c919e10901b01d`.  \nGit will checkout the branch and not the hash when someone puts `git checkout e91803d442559d6efb63102b10c919e10901b01d`.  \nGitHub prevents users from pushing branches that are the same name as hashes, but GitLab does not.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n\n1. Take a hash of a commit A  \n2. Go to any other commit B  \n3. Create a branch that is named the same as the hash from commit A  \n4. Push  \n5. If someone references the hash in their program, their \"git checkout\" will checkout commit B. Because it will use the branch name instead of the hash\n\n\n### Impact\n\nReferencing a hash isn't secure anymore. It would reference a branch that has completely different data.  \ngit shows a warning but \"git checkout {...}\" is often used.\n\nThe attacker can replace the expected code with something malicious that introduces a backdoor in the app or steal data. For example, you would be able to push a malicious branch to an auth library that introduces code to send all the user/pass data to an external server, or maybe add a a crypto miner to a web server.\n\n### Examples\n\nAny project that refs a git ref\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitlab accepts pushed branches that are 40-char hexadecimals\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGitlab shouldn't accept pushed branches that are 40-char hexadecimals (like Github does9\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n-\n\n### Output of checks\n\n-\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n-\n\n## Impact\n\nRedirect pinned refrs of libraries if there is control of a library. A referenced hash won't point to a hash anymore. An attacker can make the branch which has the hash's name contain any other data.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-07T22:50:11.955Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T12:58:13.432Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T07:11:01.164Z","closed_by":{"id":4056133,"username":"jeremymatos","name":"Jeremy Matos","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c972d878793ca2302186e5d8c0c0dd8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremymatos"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","repository","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":2167502,"username":"robotmay_gitlab","name":"Robert May","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2167502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/robotmay_gitlab"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2167502,"username":"robotmay_gitlab","name":"Robert May","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2167502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/robotmay_gitlab"},"user_notes_count":60,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-05-11","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/202690","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202690","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202690/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202690/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#202690","relative":"#202690","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#202690"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30524948,"iid":202687,"project_id":278964,"title":"Members from parent group keep their access level on a subgroup transfer and are invisible","description":"**[HackerOne report #790786](https://hackerone.com/reports/790786)** by `kryword` on 2020-02-07, assigned to @dcouture:\n\n### Summary\n\nThere's an option that allows to transfer groups from one namespace to another, it doesn't work as intended when transferring subgroups from inside a parent group to another group. Users that were part of the first parent group from where the subgroup has been transfered, keep their permissions and access level on the subgroup, wherever it was transfered and without being explicit members of the subgroup.\n\nNot only that, they don't appear as members. They have access without appearing on the members tab. They also get some sort of access to the new parent group where the subgroup has been transfered, without being members of that new group even when it's private.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create 2 different private groups (so you can instantly see when you get a 404 no access). GroupA, and GroupB.  \n2. Invite to some members to GroupA and give them maintainer/owner(for testing high privileges) access.  \n3. Don't invite anyone except yourself to groupB (this makes testing easier).  \n4. Create a subgroup in groupA, subgroupA  \n5. Create a project in subgroupA, project-test.\n\nNow, you'll see that members from groupA have access to both subgroupA and project-test, as they are members of the main group groupA.\n\n6. Transfer subgroupA to groupB.  \n7. Recheck with a user that's not a member of groupB and you'll see he keeps his permission on the transferred subgroup and it's related projects.  \n8. Also check the members tab and you'll see they don't appear there, and they have permissions to see and if they where owner/maintainer on the previous main group, they have access to settings and that sort of things.\n\n### Impact\n\nIt affects all the transferred subgroups and their projects if those were transferred from a main group to another group. Members from that main group are still ghost members and can still access and modify those groups.\n\nNot sure how much of the users have transferred groups to other groups, but it could be a lot.\n\n### Examples\n\nI've made 2 private projects for the tests, I'm making them public but you'll not be able to see the members directly, as one of the members doesn't even appear on the members tab.\n\nGroup1 (Added 2 users as members):  \nhttps://gitlab.com/groups/main_group1\n\nGroup2 (Only cristian.berner is a member of this group):  \nhttps://gitlab.com/groups/main_group2\n\nFrom Group1 I created and transfered subgroup1 with an inner project called project3 to Group2:  \nhttps://gitlab.com/main_group1/subgroup1/project3 (This would redirect to https://gitlab.com/main_group2/subgroup1/project3 as it was transferred there)\n\nNow look at members from subgroup1 and members of project3, there's no [@]kryword in there, still I have full access with that account there to remove/add members or even delete the project.\n\nI attached two screenshots showing this.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMembers from parent group are also transferred as ghost members(they're not showing in members menu) when a subgroup with projects is transferred to another group.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMembers from parent group should not be transferred or if the intended behaviour is that they also get transfered, they should show up in the members menu.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\nMembers that have been part of a parent group when a transfer happened, they have the same privileges that they had on those subgroups transferred and if they were owners for that moment, they are still owners and not even showing as members on those transfered subgroups/projects.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n[REDACTED]","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-07T22:43:59.081Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T03:03:27.316Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T07:08:55.553Z","closed_by":{"id":4056133,"username":"jeremymatos","name":"Jeremy Matos","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c972d878793ca2302186e5d8c0c0dd8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremymatos"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","HackerOne","Next Up","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::2","section::dev","security","severity::2","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-04-08","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/202687","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202687","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202687/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202687/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#202687","relative":"#202687","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#202687"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30524903,"iid":202686,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create demo project for standalone vulnerabilities","description":"## Details\n\nThe new work for standalone vulnerabilities introduces a new dashboard and a series of new workflows.

We want to fix that for the [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) project as part of our effort to learn more about [service users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6883).\n\n### Further details\n\nThis would be a very small change, and would only be used internally at GitLab.\n\n### Revised proposal v2\n\n- Allow `User` records to be marked as a `ServiceUser` using a `user_type` enum column in the database. See [detailed discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26068#note_297276094) if needed.\n- Update @gitlab-bot to be a service user.\n\n### Revised proposal\n\n- Allow `User` records to be marked as a `service_user` using a boolean column in the database.  (Not using the `bot_type` attribute due to [unexpected side effects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/202680#note_294316578), and not adding UI because this is not intended to be user-facing.)\n- Update @gitlab-bot as a `service_user`.\n\n### Original proposal\n\n- Allow `User` records to be marked as a non-human users via database queries (no UI).  That could be accomplished by adding a 4th `bot_type` enum value like `custom`.\n- Make a list of users in `gitlab-org` that should be marked as non-human users (to be used to update the records after this change is released).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis \"feature\" would require console or database access, so would be limited to admins.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThis feature would be deliberately un-documented, because it is only for internal GitLab use at this time.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSuccess is when [Code Review Analytics for the gitlab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/analytics/code_reviews) ignores all comments by non-human users.\n\n### Links / references\n\nThis is a reduced solution to the problem compared

problem is identified.\n- [x] The surface of the problem is as small as possible.\n\n## What are the potential solutions?\n\nWe started using hidden jobs to encapsulate rules:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24488#note_283555719\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24492#note_283613994\n\nWith this approach, it's possible to move all of them into a shared `rules.gitlab-ci.yml` and have YAML anchors shared across these `.rule` hidden jobs.\n\nIt would remove the need to duplicate the YAML anchors across files, because now all the reference to the YAML anchors is contained in a single file.\n\nWe can do this after we complete adopting `rule`.\n\n/cc

show warning when adding user to group that incur a charge","description":"This issue is a follow-up to [MVC: Show transparent warnings when adding a user to a group will incur a charge](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35683).\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen the user is adding members to their group we're presenting them a confirmation modal that adding more users will incur a charge, however, we're not checking if the members being added are already part of the subscription (already members of the current group or members of a sub-group).\n\n## Proposal\n\nDo a check on the invite button click, which will validate the current users being added against the subscription, then decide if adding those users will make the subscription go above its max users or not.\n\nThe checking on users needs to count for users who are part of the subscription (e.g. in a sub-group or a parent group).\n\nWhen the user clicks the \"invite\" button, we need to show a loading spinner and disable the button while the request is being made, then based on the response we either show a confirmation modal or submit the form regularly.\n\n### API endpoint specs\n\nThe endpoint will receive:\n- users ids:  comma-separated list of users as numbers (it contain emails for when the user will invite a member by email).\n- Group ID that the users are being added to.\n\nThe endpoint should return a boolean indicating if the user will increase their max seats by adding those users or not (which will tell us whether to show the warning modal or not, accordingly).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-06T15:05:23.398Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T08:11:14.382Z","closed_at":"2022-05-23T04:47:48.095Z","closed_by":{"id":4981524,"username":"jhyson","name":"Josianne
