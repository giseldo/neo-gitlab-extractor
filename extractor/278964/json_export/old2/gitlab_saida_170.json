Those pushes could receive erroneous messages.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* Anyone who Git pushes\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal keeping the cache approach\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Workhorse adds a correlation ID to POST `/-/geo-node-referrer/2/foo/bar.git/git-receive-pack`\n1. `GitHttpController#git_receive_pack` stores the Geo node ID into Redis by correlation ID\n1. Gitaly adds correlation ID to the `/api/v4/internal/post_receive` request\n1. Rails `/api/v4/internal/post_receive` fetches key by correlation ID\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n### Proposal getting rid of the cache approach\n\nThis is what I was trying to avoid by caching the geo node ID. But it's worth mentioning here since the above is non-trivial anyway.\n\n* Gitaly: Accept a new `geo_node_id` param in `ReceivePack` RPC\n* Workhorse: Call `ReceivePack` RPC with `geo_node_id` if we have it available\n* Rails: Add a `geo_node_id` param to the Workhorse OK response from `GitHttpController#git_receive_pack`\n* Gitaly: When calling post-receive hook, make sure `geo_node_id` is available\n* Gitaly: When post-receive hook calls internal API `post_receive`, add the `geo_node_id` param to the request\n* Rails: In internal API `post_receive`, use `geo_node_id` to build the replication lag message\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

There are two required steps for deleting images from the registry. The first is to untag images, which can be done via the Container Registry UI or leveraging the [Container Registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#delete-repository-tags-in-bulk). The second step is to run [garbage collection](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/README.html#removing-unused-layers-not-referenced-by-manifests) and remove any blobs (can be layers or manifests)from storage.\n\nThe problem is that the API (`Projects::Registry::TagsController#bulk_destroy`) is currently the worst performing controller/action on GitLab.com. It has a p95 of 40s and some requests take up to 60s to complete. `Projects::Registry::TagsController#destroy` is not far behind. \n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team

delete API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#delete-repository-tags-in-bulk)\n does currently run as a background job.\n- The API that powers the front end is not a background job.\n\n### Proposal\n- Improve the performance of the delete API that powers the frontend, so that we improve the performance and availability of the Container Registry user interface. \n  - One option could be moving it to a background job.\n  - Another could be improving the logic or optimizing the code (if possible)\n\n### Documentation\n- [Container Registry

reducing index size by using a different code analyzer","description":"## Summary\n\nThere's an effort to reduce to Elasticsearch index size (see #3327) on gitlab.com. One reason for the huge index size is the excessive number of terms generated by the configured `code_analyzer`. It currently uses the `whitespace` tokenizer together with a custom `code` filter generating additional terms from the terms emitted from the tokenization.\n\nFor example, the simple Javascript function call `console.log('test')` emits the following 58 tokens:\n\n```\nco\ncon\ncons\nconso\nconsol\nconsole\nconsole.\nconsole.l\nconsole.lo\nconsole.log\nconsole.log(\nconsole.log('\nconsole.log('t\nconsole.log('te\nconsole.log('tes\nconsole.log('test\nconsole.log('test'\nconsole.log('test')\nco\ncon\ncons\nconso\nconsol\nconsole\nco\ncon\ncons\nconso\nconsol\nconsole\nconsole.\nconsole.l\nconsole.lo\nconsole.log\nconsole.log(\nconsole.log('\nconsole.log('t\nconsole.log('te\nconsole.log('tes\nconsole.log('test\nlo\nlog\nlo\nlog\nlog(\nlog('\nlog('t\nlog('te\nlog('tes\nlog('test\nlog('test'\nlog('test')\nte\ntes\ntest\nte\ntes\ntest\n```\n\nAs you can see here, there are a lot of duplicated terms.\n\nThe mapping we're proposing in this issue would only emit the following 11 tokens for the same input while still supporting queries for `console.log` or `log('test')`:\n\n```\nco\ncon\ncons\nconso\nconsol\nconsole\nlo\nlog\nte\ntes\ntest\n```\n\nWe have used Elasticsearch's [Analyze API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-analyze.html) to compare the tokens produced by the different mappings.\n\n## Improvements\n\n### The Why\n\nFewer terms lead to a smaller Elasticsearch index. A smaller Elasticsearch index is faster, easier to maintain and easier to rebuild. Also the indexing time should decrease significantly due to the removal of the `code` filter which uses expensive regular expressions to extract sub-terms from to enabled searches in camel-case strings (e.g. to find GitLab when searching for Lab) or strings containing dots (e.g. to find com.gitlab when searching for gitlab). The latter feature can also be supported by using a different tokenizer.\n\nIn our tests the index size decreased by 44% due to this change. Also the indexing time was half of the indexing time achieved with the current mapping.\n\n### The What \n\n1. Instead of using the `whitespace` tokenizer for the `code_analyzer` and `code_search_analyzer`, we're proposing to use a pattern tokenizer splitting the input on all non-word characters. As a consequence no non-word characters will end up in the index.\n1. Instead of using a custom `pattern_capture` filter, we use a `word_delimiter` filter to index separate terms for camel-case and snake-case tokens.\n1. With this adapted mapping, we need to ensure that a search for `console.log` does not match documents containing the terms `console` and `log` but not adjacent to each other. Therefore, queries on fields analyzed with the `code_analyzer` must be whitespace-tokenized by the application and for each resulting token a [Match Phrase query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html) should be performed.\n\n#### Replace whitespace tokenizer with pattern tokenizer\n\nThe proposed mapping declares a custom `code_tokenizer` that is configured for the `code_analyzer` and the `code_search_analyzer`:\n\n```\n\"code_tokenizer\": {\n    \"type\": \"pattern\",\n    \"pattern\": \"\\\\W+\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Replace pattern_capture filter with word delimiter filter\n\nCurrently the code filter consists of seven patterns:\n\n```\n\"code\": {                                 \n  \"type\": \"pattern_capture\",              \n  \"preserve_original\": \"true\",            \n  \"patterns\": [                           \n    \"(\\\\p{Ll}+|\\\\p{Lu}\\\\p{Ll}+|\\\\p{Lu}+)\",\n    \"(\\\\d+)\",                             \n    \"(?=([\\\\p{Lu}]+[\\\\p{L}]+))\",          \n    \"\\\"((?:\\\\\\\"|[^\\\"]|\\\\\\\")*)\\\"\",         \n    \"'((?:\\\\'|[^']|\\\\')*)'\",              \n    \"\\\\.([^.]+)(?=\\\\.|\\\\s|\\\\Z)\",          \n    \"\\\\/?([^\\\\/]+)(?=\\\\/|\\\\b)\"            \n  ]                                       \n}                                        \n```\n\nLet's consider them one by one:\n\n```\n(\\\\p{Ll}+|\\\\p{Lu}\\\\p{Ll}+|\\\\p{Lu}+)\n```\n\nWe suppose this one is for supporting substring searches for camel-case or snake-case tokens. This pattern would add the terms \"Git\" and \"Lab\" to a term such as \"GitLab\" or \"Git-Lab\" emitted by the tokenizer. The new solution will also need to support this feature.\n\n```\n(\\\\d+)\n```\n\nThis one extracts numbers from terms and indexes them as separate terms. For example, it would add '500' as a separate term for the token 'Indy500'. We're in doubt that this is really a valuable feature. Personally, I would not expect this search result.\n\n```\n(?=([\\\\p{Lu}]+[\\\\p{L}]+))\n```\n\nWe suppose this is just a special case for the camel-case search to support searches for 'CSVParser' to match documents containing a string such as 'customCSVParser'.\n\n```\n\\\"((?:\\\\\\\"|[^\\\"]|\\\\\\\")*)\\\"\n```\n\nThis pattern extracts strings enclosed in double quotes such as \"GitLab\". As the whitespace tokenizer is currently used, this pattern is useless for inputs such as \"GitLab Inc.\" because the tokenizer already splits this input into '\"GitLab' and 'Inc.\"'. The proposed solution does not index double-quotes and therefore makes this capture pattern obsolete.\n\n```\n'((?:\\\\'|[^']|\\\\')*)'\n```\n\nSame as the pattern for double-quotes, just for single-quotes.\n\n```\n\\\\.([^.]+)(?=\\\\.|\\\\s|\\\\Z)\n```\n\nExtracts terms for a token such as a Java package name. For example, for the token 'com.gitlab.elastic' the terms 'com', 'gitlab' and 'elastic' will be added to the index. With the proposed solution, the tokenizer will already split this string into three separate terms.\n\n```\n\\\\/?([^\\\\/]+)(?=\\\\/|\\\\b)\n```\n\nThis pattern does something similar as the previous pattern just for file or URL paths such as '/usr/lib/gitlab'. With the new mapping it will also be the responsibility of the tokenizer to do the splitting.\n\nSo if we remove the code filter entirely, there are just two features we will need to take care of in a replacement:\n\n- Search in camel-case and snake-case tokens.\n- Eventually search for numbers within alphanumeric tokens such as 'Indy500'. The proposed solution currently does not cover this, but it could be extended to do so.\n\nTo cover the search in camel-case and snake-case tokens, we've added a [Word Delimiter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/analysis-word-delimiter-tokenfilter.html) token filter to the `code_analyzer` as well as the `code_search_analyzer`:\n\n```\n\"camelCase\": {                 \n  \"type\": \"word_delimiter\",    \n  \"split_on_case_change\": true,\n  \"preserve_original\": true    \n}\n```\n\nConceptionally this does the same as the `code` analyzer that's currently used. The word delimiter filter automatically splits on an underscore character which is why this solution also works for snake-case tokens. The split_on_case_change option supports the camel-case feature.\n\n#### Use match_phrase queries for fields analyzed with code_analyzer\n\nTo ensure that a query for `console.log test` won't match a document containing the terms `console`, `log` and `test` in totally different locations, the queries on fields using the `code_analyzer` should be changed to match_phrase queries. We suggest to split the user input by whitespace and then to create a match_phrase query for each resulting token. All match_phrase queries must match the document to still support queries such as \"ClassName methodName\" where the ClassName is not adjacent to methodName in the document.\n\n## Risks\n\nOf course, this is a very involved change that can have subtle side-effects.

export to be of constant memory","description":"Building the hash of project export in memory is very expensive operation.\n\nWe can significantly improve it by serializing and writing to JSON at the same time\ninstead of storing `Hash` representation in memory.\n\nThis allows us to quickly allocate and quickly free memory used by export,\ninstead of retaining it for longer period of time.\n\n## Original description\n\n\u003e It seems that the biggest cost of `export` is keeping in-memory structure of hash. When I tested the hash size I noticed this to take `250MB` for `gitlabhq`.\n\u003e This is first step, then during save, we effectively duplicate and rewrite that hash.\n\u003e Then we serialize this hash to string.\n\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/32423/diffs?commit_id=a33994318c3212a49338553e83bc4709271648a6 \u003e this makes to be serializer almost of constant size, except the memory growth related to storing `string` with `json`. We serialize small chunks, and forget the hash.\n\n\u003e I was able to get down from 1.2G after export to 510MB. The memory allocated did hover around 600MB during the export.\n\n\u003e But so far it seems that we can:\n\n\u003e 1. Shorten export by about 4x times with N+1 fix,\n\u003e 1. We can reduce memory footprint (for gitlabhq) from around 700MB (on top of process), to around 150MB.\n\nRelated to: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/32579\n\nConfirmed by

integration sends status from multiple pipelines when using `only/except: external_pull_request`","description":"### Summary\n\nWith the pipelines for external pull requests, introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/65139 we are enabling users to run a pipeline in the context of a GitHub pull request.\n\nGiven the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nalways-run:\n  script: echo 'this should always run'\n  \non-pull-requests:\n  script: echo 'this should run on pull requests'\n  only:\n    - external_pull_requests\n\nexcept-pull-requests:\n  script: \n    - echo 'this should not run on pull requests'\n    - sleep 20\n    # make the job fail with a command that does not exist\n    - s\n  except:\n    - external_pull_requests\n```\n\nWhen changes are pushed to the branch we detect that aside from a branch push there is a pull request open on GitHub and we ALSO create a pipeline for the external pull request (as expected by design):\n\n![image](/uploads/f984a88f76afa90820cd145df3fec4b5/image.png)\n\nIn the screenshot above, pipeline `12648771` (which is successful) is for the external pull request while pipeline `12648770` (which is failed) is for the branch push.\n\nOn GitHub, we update the status of the pull request with the status of the pipeline that finishes last\n\n![image](/uploads/ba2e180c7e0fa6430d365404e214f3d2/image.png)\n\nIn the case above, we updated the status as failed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* create new project as CI/CD for external repo\n* select GitHub as option\n* import repository\n* GitHub integration should also be active\n* add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` on GitHub repository containg the yaml above\n* push changes to GitHub, to a new branch, and open a pull request\n* pushing new changes to the same branch, this time, we should see 2 pipelines being created\n* the failing pipeline is for the branch push and the passing pipeline is for the pull request\n* Github status shows failing pipeline\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWe send to GitHub the status of the latest pipeline which in this case could be in the context of the `branch`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe should send to GitHub the status of the pull request pipeline\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWhen the `.gitlab-ci.yml` does not contain any `only/except: external_pull_requests` perhaps the user wants to still see the status of the branch pipeline in the pull request. However, in presence of `only/except: external_pull_requests` we should choose to send the status of the pipeline for external pull request over the pipeline for the branch.\n\n## Workaround\n\nIt should be possible to avoid that by ensuring that by ensuring no jobs run on `branches`:\n\n```yaml\nalways-run:\n  script: echo 'this should always run'\n  except:\n    - branches\n  \non-pull-requests:\n  script: echo 'this should run on pull requests'\n  only:\n    - external_pull_requests\n\nexcept-pull-requests:\n  script: \n    - echo 'this should not run on pull requests'\n    - sleep 20\n    # make the job fail with a command that does not exist\n    - s\n  except:\n    - branches\n    - external_pull_requests\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-11T09:08:42.033Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T11:30:19.037Z","closed_at":"2019-12-17T14:14:47.426Z","closed_by":{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:12.5","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"}],"author":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24089","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24089","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24089/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24089/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24089","relative":"#24089","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24089"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24676202,"iid":24088,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make logs directly available off the Operations tab","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe would like to provide our users with a quick and easy way to view Kubernetes monitored logs\n\n### Intended users\n\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Further details\n\nToday we do not have a quick and easy way to navigate directly to the operation's logs view, \nusers need to go into Operation tab -\u003e environment\n\n![image](/uploads/eed19d4e14985e5be377854f172f9139/image.png)\n\nClick on an instance to view its logs\n\n![image](/uploads/013f6ed25bc29d108829eb11e8332df8/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\nAdd a \"Logs\" tab directly off the operations tab, this tab should display the logs which are stored in Elasticsearch\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/5769 is a pre-requisite for this feature\n\n### Design\n\nThe scope for this issue includes:\n*  Adding \"Pod Logs\" as a nav item under Operations\n*  Adding an empty state for Pod Logs:\n\n![24088-make-logs-directly-available-empty-state](/uploads/b66f0ca21d838cc51744c46097fa84ad/24088-make-logs-directly-available-empty-state.png)\n\n*  The \"enable\" button will send users to Operations \u003e Kubernetes \u003e Cluster \"detail\" page (where the Applications are shown).

developer can change status of a pipeline of a protected branch","description":"**[HackerOne report #688205](https://hackerone.com/reports/688205)** by `rpadovani` on 2019-09-04, assigned to `akelly`:\n\n### Summary\n\nA developer of a project can change the pipeline status of a protected branch to any value.  \nThis allows to hide the status of protected pipelines, but also to skip the check \"Pipeline must succeed before merging\".\n\nI think there are two issues, but are on a single endpoint so I was not sure if report them separately made any sense\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThere are two issues here:  \n- the behaviour of the `POST /projects/:id/statuses/:sha` API  \n- the lack of authentication on the endpoint\n\nTo reproduce:  \n- Create a failing gitlab-ci.yml (for the sake of simplicity, but you can create also a valid one and go the other way around).  \nFor example:\n\n```  \ntest:  \n  script:  \n    - COMMAND_NOT_FOUND  \n  only:  \n    - master  \n```\n\n- Check the pipelines as developer of the project:\n\n```  \ncurl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: secret\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12915125/pipelines\" \n\n[{\"id\":80342609,\"sha\":\"8c6f0f9e6fb0b71a51503655a512884bd53eaa69\",\"ref\":\"master\",\"status\":\"failed\",\"web_url\":\"https://gitlab.com/rpadovani.test/public-project-secret-code/pipelines/80342609\"}]%  \n```\n\nas a developer, I don't have edit rights on the master branch.  \nStill, I can invoke the API for setting the status of the build of the associated commit:\n\n```  \ncurl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: secret\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12915125/statuses/8c6f0f9e6fb0b71a51503655a512884bd53eaa69?state=success\u0026name=test\"  \n```\n\nThe important thing here is putting the name of the existing stage(s) in the parameter **name**.  \nWhen we query the pipelines endpoint again, we see the result is changed:\n\n```  \ncurl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: secret\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12915125/pipelines\"                   \n[{\"id\":80342609,\"sha\":\"8c6f0f9e6fb0b71a51503655a512884bd53eaa69\",\"ref\":\"master\",\"status\":\"success\",\"web_url\":\"https://gitlab.com/rpadovani.test/public-project-secret-code/pipelines/80342609\"}  \n```\n\nIf you open the pipeline page, you see that something strange happened, but it is very confusing.  \nOn the other hand, in the homepage of the project and in other places where the pipeline icon appears, there is nothing that suggest the pipeline originally failed and has been overwritten.\n\nI see three issues here:  \n- the behaviour of the API: it shouldn't accept names of other stages, or at least it shouldn't overwrite them  \n- the authorization part: I know it is tricky, due how a commit could belong to multiple branches, but if exists a pair (commit, ref) where ref is protected, a developer shouldn't be able to change the status of the build  \n- the UI is messy about this: there is no clear difference between \"internal\"  and \"external\" status, and it is easy getting confused (not really a security issue, but confusion helps always the attacker)\n\n### Impact\n\nTwo main impacts:  \n- On a protected ref: A developer can simulate a deploy was successful / failed while in the reality failed/succeeded.  \n- In a MR the developer can avoid the \"pipeline must succeeds to merge\"  check, manually setting it to success\n\n### Examples\n\nI can give access to an example project\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API allows overriding general status of a pipeline  \nThe API doesn't do any check on the ref related to the commit - especially if the developer can access protected branches\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNo override, proper authorization\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\n- On a protected ref: A developer can simulate a deploy was successful / failed while in the reality failed/succeeded.  \n- In a MR the developer can avoid the \"pipeline must succeeds to merge\"  check, manually setting it to success","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-10T23:23:14.761Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T07:42:05.786Z","closed_at":"2020-01-28T16:13:37.628Z","closed_by":{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius

the external source takes too long to complete and the URL of the source file in the object-store expires.\n\nSo the proposed solution is to make the upload quicker by not using `Gitlab::HttpIO#read` that makes several calls to the object store requesting a small chunk of the file, and instead, read the file as a stream.

The `ProjectsFinder` uses an initial collection, which consists of the projects the authenticated user can access. However, it does **not** check the access level of the user. This means that any project that is public, but has Repository, Issue, Snippets (etc.) access disabled for Guests, will be returned by the `available_custom_project_templates` method on the `User` model. In a perfect world, it seems that this method would limit the projects that can be returned based on the user's permissions for said

This problem is exacerbated by implementing automatic refresh in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/3474\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Idea 1: Pause usage of individual foreign tables\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n1. try to hold a lock on a single foreign table for X amount of time (1s or less, using something like statement timeouts?)\n1. if we can get the lock, drop and recreate that table\n1. if we can't, assign to a queue of tables that requires extra care\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n#### Idea 2: Surgical foreign schema update\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/3474#note_212602755:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nThe FDW refresh code was done that way with a drop and reimport because it was the easiest way of doing it... perhaps we should take a step back and figure out how to refresh, when upgrading, only the tables with some change.\n\nI can propose a simple algorithm (implementation will not be trivial, but the idea is):\n\n1. dump a list of tables on both sides, recreate first the missing ones\n1. loop over the previous list of tables, and see if anyone needs to be recreated (because they differ). drop the foreign table and use the import limiting to that single table.\n\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-importforeignschema.html\n\nWe can also try to do use current algorithm first, with a sql statement timeout, if it fails we switch to the 'slow version'.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nIn this proposal, many foreign schema updates touch tables that don't matter to Geo, therefore they will not cause a hiccup, as opposed to dropping the entire schema.\n\n#### Idea 3: Pause usage of tracking database\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/3474#note_212602755:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nWe can also try to implement a semaphore for the use of the tracking database (perhaps on the log cursor loop), so we could \"pause\" the use of the database, to perform a FDW refresh, and unpause it at the end (use TTL and exclusive lease for that).\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nThis gives us the ability to decide exactly what should happen during a refresh. Though this may be a significant interruption in usage, which isn't *overly* helpful by itself.\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Links /

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- [-] If I recall, there was related documentation that should be removed\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

A token that only allows the `read_repository` and **not** the `read_registry` scope can be used to access the docker registry.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project  \n2. Create a deploy token with a username and **only** `read_repository` scope  \n3. Using that token, login to the docker registry via `docker login registry.gitlab.example.com -u \u003cdeploy-token-user\u003e -p \u003cdeploy-token\u003e\n\n```bash  \n▶ docker login registry.example.gitlab.com -u \u003cdeploy-token-user\u003e -p \u003cdeploy-token\u003e  \nWARNING!

See  \nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store\n\nLogin Succeeded  \n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis gives unauthorized users access to the docker registry. Furthermore, there is no auditing. So you do not know that a unprivileged token was used to access the registry.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDeploy tokens without `read_registry` scope can be used to access the docker registry.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nDeploy tokens without `read_registry` scope ***cannot** be used to access the docker registry.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\nBest regards,  \nXanbanx\n\n## Impact\n\nSee above.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-05T09:05:54.337Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T12:05:00.703Z","closed_at":"2020-03-09T18:16:40.540Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","HackerOne","Package:P2","devops::package","group::package registry","priority::2","security","severity::2","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":40,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-10-25","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/31599","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/31599","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/31599/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/31599/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#31599","relative":"#31599","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#31599"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24484575,"iid":14755,"project_id":278964,"title":"Clarify why Service Desk feature is unavailable","description":"### Problem\nCurrently, even if the correct plan is purchased, the service desk feature is completely invisible if the configuration is invalid.
