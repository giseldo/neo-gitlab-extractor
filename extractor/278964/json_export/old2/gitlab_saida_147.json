We should provide a better feeling to Enterprise customers that they are in control of their own \"instance\" on GitLab.com.\n\n# Proposal\n\n* Add new `Administration` menu item for **Group Owners** at the *parent group level*\n* Move `SAML SSO` under the `Administration` menu\n* Move `Usage Quotas` under the `Administration` menu\n* Move `Billing` under the `Administration menu`\n* Remove `Restrict access by IP address` and `Restrict membership by email` settings from _subgroups_, since they are never able to be edited at the subgroup level\n\n# Why is this important?\n\nExtending Group Managed Accounts to all groups is our first step towards a better experience on GitLab.com for Enterprises wanting isolation and control over their projects, groups and users and a big part of this is introducing administration controls for their group. Introducing this new menu and cleaning up menu items allows us to iterate in the future by further including more admin functions and therefore empowering our Enterprise customers, and adds more emphasis on SAML SSO + GMA as a new feature.\n\n# Related Epics and Issues\n* https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4419\n* https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4257\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209020\n* https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2885","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-04T23:26:55.606Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T13:54:18.460Z","closed_at":"2021-07-07T01:41:40.520Z","closed_by":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"labels":["Category:Subgroups","Deliverable","GitLab.com Enterprise Readiness","UX","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","isolation","priority::2","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"}],"author":{"id":1903246,"username":"tipyn","name":"Luca Kisielius","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1903246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tipyn"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209020","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209020","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209020/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209020/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#209020","relative":"#209020","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#209020"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2963,"epic":{"id":34667,"iid":2963,"title":"🔧 Improved Administration of Group Managed Accounts","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2963","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":31572078,"iid":209018,"project_id":278964,"title":"Do not require SSO to be enforced for Group Managed Accounts to be enabled [BE]","description":"# To do\n\nIn order to [extend group managed accounts to all groups](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2777), we should not require SSO for GMA to be enabled. Please review the epic's [problem statement](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2777#problem) for further context.\n\nThe initial BE work to enable this separation is to decouple GMA configuration from our SSO code and configuration. For example, the field `saml_providers.enforced_group_managed_accounts` should be moved out of the `saml_providers` table.\n\nThe goal is this Issue is to decouple the code without changing the current User Experience. To do that, we will need to introduce a new path to enable GMA that isn't as dependent on enabling SSO.\n\nAlso worth consideration: we currently link a User to a Group Managed Account through `users.managing_group_id`. We should consider whether there's any value in changing this relationship to consider that in the future we will be introducing \"Organizations\" https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/-/issues/16377.

Set up a group, subgroup, and project structure like the following.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[Group]--\u003eB[Subgroup 1 - Projects];\n  B--\u003eC[Projects];\n  A--\u003eD[Subgroup 2 - Users];\n```\n\n2. Invite a user to `Subgroup 2 - Users` as a `Maintainer`.\n3. [Share](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#sharing-a-group-with-another-group-core-only) `Subgroup 2 - Users` with Subgroup 1 - Projects and select `Maintainer` as the access level. \n4. Observe that the added user can see the project that was just created in `Subgroup 1 - Projects`.\n5. Create another project in `Subgroup 1 - Projects`.\n6. Observe that the added user cannot see the project that was created after `Subgroup 2 - Users` was shared with `Subgroup 1 - Projects` and may or may not be able to access it even if they are told the project path of the new project.\n\n#### Scenario 2\n\n1. Set up a group, subgroup, and project structure like the following.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[Group]--\u003eB[Subgroup 1];\n  B--\u003eC[Subgroup 2 - Users];\n  B--\u003eD[Project];\n```\n\n2. Invite a user to `Subgroup 2 - Users` as a `Maintainer`.\n3. Share access to `Subgroup 2 - Users` with `Subgroup 1` with `Maintainer` level access.\n4. Observe that the user can see the project that was already within `Subgroup 1` but will not be able to see or access any further projects or subgroups created within `Subgroup 1`.\n\n### Example Setup\n\n- [Top-level group](https://gitlab.com/148890)\n- [Subgroup (for projects)](https://gitlab.com/148890/subgroup)\n- [Subgroup (for users only)](https://gitlab.com/148890/subgroup-maintainer)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsers who are given access to a subgroup via a share from another subgroup are unable to see projects created in that subgroup after the sharing has been enabled.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUsers given access to a subgroup via sharing with another subgroup should be able to see all projects in that subgroup, regardless of their creation date.\n\n### Workaround\n\nThere are two ways to work around this.\n\n1.

In this example, we would filter by `package_type`, however, if more than one `conan_package.tgz` exists, we need to use the incoming `conan_package_reference` (conan's package id) to know which file is being requested. \n\nWe need to add a filter to the package finder for `conan_package_reference` and [pass the incoming param into the finder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/51f5467ce9c120e76ad6f5aa4f76bdcd5dded285/ee/lib/api/helpers/packages/conan/api_helpers.rb#L95) from the API endpoint.\n\nIt's possible there's more needed to fix this, but this is the first change that needs to be made and tested.\n\nWhile working though this, it should be verified that the `conan_package_reference` value is being utilized properly in the other endpoints as well.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-03T18:50:23.944Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T22:05:58.546Z","closed_at":"2020-03-23T15:37:27.110Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Conan Repository","customer","devops::package","group::package registry","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208830","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208830","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208830/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208830/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208830","relative":"#208830","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208830"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31515465,"iid":208822,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Resolve \"Usage Ping timeouts on security_products_usage for large hosts\"\"","description":"The following discussion from !26296 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @a_akgun started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26296#note_297583721):  (+6 comments)\n\n    \u003e @dstull :thinking:  in this old logic, is there any risk for `\u0026\u0026 results[:license_management_jobs]` to be nil?

the application component.\n* Walk through an entire use case.\n* At key points, take a snapshot of the **difference** between the last snapshot.\n\nThis will complement our unit tests and feature specs nicely by testing all of the FE components in integration in a faster way. We'll also use this higher-level test to identify unit test gaps.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/202243\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Let's setup a feature test environment with appropriate mocks.\n- Let's write a test for adding and committing a file to a sub directory.\n\nThis issue is mostly focused on setting up the necessary test helpers. We'll expand with more tests in the future.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-03T15:32:52.575Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T15:22:37.738Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T15:22:37.694Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Deliverable","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","missed:13.3","section::dev","test","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"}],"author":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208800","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208800","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208800/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208800/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208800","relative":"#208800","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208800"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2578,"epic":{"id":18912,"iid":2578,"title":"IDE Quality Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2578","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31502625,"iid":208786,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor snippets controllers","description":"There is a lot of code duplication inside snippet's controllers.

However, performance of the environment still degrades when the Branches API is tested at load.\n\nUsing the [latest 10k results](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/wikis/Benchmarks/Latest/10k) as a record of performance, we now want to iterate on the performance and get this response down to between 1000ms and 2000ms. Our ultimate goal will be to respond in under 500ms, but this will require iteration.\n\n### Useful information\n\n- You can view Branches#index in Grafana [here](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/rPsQXrImk/rails-controller?orgId=1\u0026refresh=1m\u0026var-env=gprd\u0026var-type=web\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-controller=Projects::BranchesController\u0026var-action=index)\n- You can use the [GitLab Performance Tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance) by running this command: `./run-k6 -e environments/10k.json -s scenarios/60s_200rps.json -t tests/api/api_v4_projects_repository_branches.js`\n- You can find a `stackprof` sample [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30536#note_294556830)\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. If wanting to test against your own environment you can do. this by following the setup instructions of the Quality team's [GitLab Performance Tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance) here - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/blob/master/docs/README.md\n1. After performing all the necessary prep as per the documentation above you can run the specific test by passing it's name via the tests command line option - `api_v4_projects_repository_branches`. A good RPS to start with for a local install is 20.\n1.

This would enable the community to both contribute fixes for languages as well as add new languages that might be supported in blob view, but not in the Web IDE.\n\n### Who can address the issue\n\n\u003c!-- What if any special expertise is required to resolve this issue? --\u003e\n\nThis issue should be addressed by the ~\"group::editor\" ~frontend engineers with support from ~documentation.\n\n### Other links/references\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/206964\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25966","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-02T20:16:08.408Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T10:51:48.040Z","closed_at":"2020-06-18T10:51:47.936Z","closed_by":{"id":236961,"username":"marcia","name":"Marcia Ramos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/236961/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marcia"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Deliverable","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","documentation","frontend","group::editor","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":5068667,"username":"rkuba","name":"Roman Kuba","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5068667/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkuba"}],"author":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5068667,"username":"rkuba","name":"Roman Kuba","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5068667/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkuba"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208731","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208731","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208731/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208731/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208731","relative":"#208731","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208731"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1474,"epic":{"id":8413,"iid":1474,"title":"Syntax Highlighting Parity in the Web IDE","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1474","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31472296,"iid":208724,"project_id":278964,"title":"Tech Evaluation: Make Release data available through GraphQL API","description":"\u003c!-- Instructions: Use this template for a proof of concept or when a deeper technical evaluation is required.

The queue is filled by `after_commit` hooks (instead of enqueuing those sidekiq jobs), and emptied by an `ElasticIndexBulkCronWorker`, which pulls 1000 documents each minute and submits them as a single bulk request. The idea is that bulk processing is more efficient and should lead to less pressure on redis, sidekiq, and the elasticsearch cluster itself.\n\nProject index/update/delete operations remains as separate `ElasticIndexerWorker` jobs, as does all backfill.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThere are a few possible scenarios.\n\nWe might have a bug that leads to some indexing not happening when it should.\n\nWe might not empty the queue as fast as it is filled. This would have negative impacts for redis. Queue size can be determined from rails console with `Elastic::ProcessBookkeepingService.queue_size`\n\nWe might misbehave when processing a project that hasn't yet had initial backfill applied (I did test this locally, but you never know).\n\nOther issues might manifest in a highly concurrent environment that are not obvious from a single-node dev deployment.\n\nWe might DESTROY REDIS.

It could provide version metadata if it scanned the file name for specific version formats.\n\nIt can provided the following benefits:\n1. Function as an interim packaged binaries repository for a format not yet supported by GitLab (where there are no dependency resolution requirements).  In some cases dev team generated binary packages can be downloaded and run locally if they have no dependencies or if all dependencies are in public repositories.  For example custom RPM files.\n2. Function as an interim solution when a supported format has a specific bug or lacks a needed feature.  I had this happen when a companies NuGet package format would not support files above 2GB, but the raw feed had no such limitation.\n3. Function as a permanent solution for formats GitLab elects not to support.\n4. Function as a interim or permanent solution for newly emerging binary package formats.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Provide the ability to upload and download arbitrary binary files in a special repository format.\n2. Allow scraping of version information from file name.\n3.

It also allows *html tags and attributes* in the description of the openapi. Although it removes malicious tags and attributes, but this is not enough in gitlab's context:\n\n1. `class` and `style` attributes allow attackers to arbitrarily present their disposition. My demo below uses `class` attribute to create a transparent layer that fulfils the document to intercept any user's clics.\n\n2. `data-*` attributes, under the help of [jquery-ujs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/package.json#L90), allows attackers to create any requests to server when user clicking (not only `GET`, but also, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`) with arbitrary parameters\n\n3. The current CSP is easily by passed by [jQuery.globalEval](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/main.js#L54). In my demo below, you should see an `alert` after clicking anywhere\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. In any project, create a file naming `xss-openapi.json`, then put the following content:  \n```  \n{\n  \"swagger\" : \"2.0\",  \n  \"info\" : {  \n    \"description\" : \"\u003ca href=https://gitlab.com/yvvdwf/data/-/wikis/alert.md data-type=script style='cursor:default' data-remote=true class='atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert(0)\u003c/script\u003e\"  \n  }}  \n```\n\n2. Click anywhere on the document view, you should see an alert.\n\n### Impact\n\nThere are three impacts as in the Summary above. The most important impact is the stored-XSS allowing attackers to perform any action on behalf of users at the client side.\n\n### Examples\n\n(This repository is in private mode, please let me know if you cannot access it)  \nhttps://gitlab.com/yvvdwf/xss/-/blob/master/xss-openapi.json\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitlab does not check the result generated by SwaggerUIBundle\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nShould remove any inappropriate html attributes, such as, `data-*`, `style`, `class`.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\nThe stored-XSS allows attackers to perform any action on behalf of users at the client side.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-02T12:09:40.062Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T10:05:24.677Z","closed_at":"2020-07-01T19:52:22.275Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-05-22","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208685","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208685","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208685/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208685/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208685","relative":"#208685","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208685"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":31452496,"iid":208679,"project_id":278964,"title":"`flaky-examples-check` duration recently increased","description":"## What is the productivity problem to solve?\n\n`flaky-examples-check` duration recently increased (https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/496118/Engineering-Productivity-Sandbox?widget=7844167\u0026udv=785399).

We should do a technical analysis to see how feasible building something with feature parity would be, if so how much work is needed, or if that would even work at all for GitLab.\n\n## Result of the research\n\n### Overview - translating the differences\n\n- Jenkins home has a `config.xml` which contains Jenkins server information. We \"may\" not be interested at all in this file.\n- Inside `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs` we have the definition of a Jenkins job. This does not match to GitLab jobs but it's rather a self contained pipeline where each steps of the job are run sequentially, pretty much like a 1 step per stage.\n- **Translation issues**: not all Jenkins build steps and post-build actions directly translate to GitLab jobs. We need to do our best effort to tackle the most important ones first. For those items where the translation is not complete we would need to log it properly for users to understand where the gaps are and how to fix it manually.\n- Each step of the Jenkins build has it's own set of parameters and settings. The structure is not as standardized as GitLab jobs. To effectively translate each build we need to create adapters for each of their types. We could start with the basic steps + those added by the most common plugins but we won't be able to cover them all. Having these adapters open-source it means that users can contribute to supporting more of them and improve the importer.\n- As it's likely impossible to support all plugins, there will always be something not properly imported. We need to clearly define whether we want the importer to fail or to import as much as it can, skipping steps that cannot be imported. Logging and \"import coverage\" is essential for user to understand the gaps. This aspect would mark the difference between a broken tool and one that is useful anyway.\n- Multiple Jenkins projects can actually build on the same repository. This, in principle, is equivalent to having child pipelines running in parallel. When importing a Jenkins project we should look at what repository is being used and \"merge\" the resulting pipeline structure with any existing pipeline structures into the `.gitlab-ci.yml` of the repository. For example: if `project-1-a` and `project-1-b` both build for `project-1` repository. When importing `project-1-a` we build the first version of `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Then, when importing `project-1-b` we need to overlap the resulting pipeline structure with the existing one, in a way that they can run in parallel. This could be done leveraging child parent pipelines.\n- It's important to understand that we cannot achieve 100% translation as some concepts may not even exist on GitLab and vice-versa. We will be looking at translating the max common denominator between Jenkins and GitLab. Implementation of the remaining configurations may vary depending on the user's preferences so the will need to be done manually.\n\n```yaml\nproject-1-a:\n  trigger:\n    include: project-1-a.yml\n\nproject-1-b:\n  trigger:\n    include: project-1-b.yml\n```\n\nBelow are more details of the main types of pipelines that Jenkins supports by default. There may be more depending on the plugins used though.\n\nEach of these pipelines could be chained together (as we do with multi-project pipelines) or project subscriptions.\n\n### Free-style project\n\nThe `jobs/\u003cjob-name\u003e/config.xml` uses a top level `\u003cproject\u003e` node.\n\nFor example. Having the `Build` section of a Jenkins project\n\n```\njob1\n  - shell-script-1\n  - shell-script-2\n  - send-slack-notification\n```\n\nshould translate to a child pipeline `job1.yml`\n\n```yaml\nstages:\n  - step-1\n  - step-2\n  - step-3\n\nshell-script-1:\n  stage: step-1\n  script: shell-script-1\n\nshell-script-2:\n  stage: step-2\n  script: shell-script-2\n\nsend-slack-notification:\n  stage: step-3\n  script: send-slack-notification\n```\n\nPost-build Actions in Jenkins can map to normal jobs that just occur at the end of the pipeline.\n\n### Pipeline\n\nThe `jobs/\u003cjob-name\u003e/config.xml` changes by using a top level `\u003cflow-definition plugin=\"workflow-job@2.36\"\u003e` to define a different structure.\n\nThe `General` and `Build Triggers` section is the same as the free-style project.\n\nThe `Pipeline` section is where the pipeline script, as in a `Jenkinsfile` is defined. This can use:\n- declarative syntax\n- scripted syntax\n\nParsing pipeline scripts is very hard. **Can we evaluate this script using a Jenkins sandbox?**. This could be possible by using https://lackastack.net/posts/gitlabci-jenkinsfile from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208277 and build a script that generates a Jenkins sandbox container based on the customer's version of the Jenkins ecosystem.\n\n### Multi-configuration project (Matrix Project Plugin)\n\nThe `jobs/\u003cjob-name\u003e/config.xml` changes by using a top level `\u003cmatrix-project plugin=\"matrix-project@1.14\"\u003e` to define a different structure.\n\nThis a typical matrix-style project to allow multiple combinations of configurations.\n\nThe `General`, `SCM`, `Build Triggers`, `Build` and `Post-build Actions` is the same as the free-style project.\n\nThe main difference is the definition of Matrix-style configurations where user defines axis and values and produces configurations that run in parallel where for each configuration, each step runs in sequence (like a free-style project).\n\n### How does this level of import relate to running a Jenkinsfile?\n\nTranslating information from `config.xml` applies to a higher level translation than either https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208276 or https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208275. The declarative and scripted `Jenkinsfile` translator would be responsible to turn part of the [Pipeline Jenkins item](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208668#pipeline) to a `.gitlab-ci.yml` snippet. This issue is more about translating a higher level of details to a `.gitlab-ci.yml`.\n\n#### example: translate a Jenkins Pipeline project to GitLab\n\nLike every Jenkins projects a Pipeline will have a `General` section which contains some metadata. We might not be able to translate some of these configurations but some may be translatable like importing `SLACKTOKEN` as pipeline variable.\n\n![image](/uploads/56c6ecddbc570f65267c93805e929c42/image.png)\n\n**`Build triggers`**: e.g. is this a pipeline to be triggered on `push` event? Or should we register a scheduled pipeline with the same cronjob? Is this pipeline triggered when another pipeline triggers? (e.g. multi-project pipeline)\n\n![image](/uploads/097020e22a173439317f56711403e69f/image.png)\n\nand finally the **`Pipeline`** section which is where a user can input the content of a `Jenkinsfile` or a path to a `Jenkinsfile` inside the workspace.\n\n![image](/uploads/5ef4023ae38412c1bf033dbd6b13e46f/image.png)\n\nThe issues https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208276 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208275 are only focusing on translating the content of a `Jenkinsfile`, which is the last section above.\n\nAll the configurations set via the UI are persisted in a `config.xml` file. An importer like **Bamboo** looks at the `config.xml` file and tries to replicate a pipeline or sequence of builds. I'm not sure whether **Bamboo** is able to import and translate `Jenkinsfile`s. I couldn't find any documentation about it. **Bamboo** also requires the Jenkins Build Pipeline plugin to be installed in the Jenkins instance prior to reading the `config.xml`. What this plugin does is allowing to connect a sequence of Jenkins projects/builds in a form of a pipeline. These connections between builds (e.g. run project-B after project-A) seem to be saved in the `config.xml`. \n\nIn short, a **Bamboo-like** importer would import static project configurations but not a translated form of a `Jenkinsfile` which is a pipeline as a code. This importer would work well for **Free-style project** or **Multi-configuration project**. In addition, for **Pipeline projects**, this importer could carry some extra information such as whether a pipeline is triggered on `push` or via a crontab shedule.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-02T09:20:43.518Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T17:52:09.113Z","closed_at":"2020-04-24T14:00:36.075Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Pipeline Authoring","Verify::P1","devops::verify","missed:12.10","missed:12.9","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":2243533,"username":"jyavorska","name":"Jason Yavorska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2243533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jyavorska"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208668","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208668","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208668/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208668/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208668","relative":"#208668","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208668"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
