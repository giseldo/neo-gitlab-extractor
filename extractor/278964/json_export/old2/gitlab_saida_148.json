We are looking to more clearly annotate in the yaml and environment experience the state of non-deployment environment jobs \n\nToday, we have [`environment:action:`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#environmentaction) keyword in .gitlab-ci.yml that supports `start` and `stop` as the value. If it's not specified, **`start` is used by default**. But this behavior causes some problems in advanced CD scenario.\n\n#### Problem 1: Approvals for deployments\n\nLooking at this blog post https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/02/20/protecting-manual-jobs/, it suggests defining two jobs `approve` and `deploy` with the same `environment:name:`. The `approval` job must specify `environment:` keyword because it restricts manual-job permission via [protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html). For example, user has the following .gitlab-ci.yml:\n\n```yml\napprove:\n  stage: approve\n  script: echo\n  environment:\n    name: production\n    url: https://example.com\n  when: manual\n  allow_failure: false\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  script: echo\n  environment:\n    name: production\n    url: https://example.com\n```\n\nThis works as-is, however, it causes a side effect that users see `approve` job as the latest _deployment_ job in [environment/deployment page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments.html#viewing-environments-and-deployments), which is **not true**. This is because the system recognizes the `appprove` job as `environment:action:start` job, which implies that the job is supposed to start an environment with deploying new code, which again **not true**.\n\n#### Problem 2: Preparation for deployments\n\nAs @caroga pointed out in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215469#note_331095252, `environment:` keyword could be specified to a job that just _builds_ an docker image for a latter deployment stage. In this case, `environment:` must be specified because [environment-specific variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#limiting-environment-scopes-of-environment-variables) are used in the build script. For example, user has the following .gitlab-ci.yml:\n\n```yaml\nbuild-review-nginx:\n  script: build_nginx\n  environment:\n    name: review\n\nbuild-review-fpm:\n  script: build_fpm\n  environment:\n    name: review\n```\n\nHowever, it doesn't work as intended because [Limit the pipeline job concurrency](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#resource_group) and [Skip outdated deployment jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs) features do **NOT** allow to run multiple jobs to run on the same environment concurrently. This is because the system recognizes the `build-review-nginx` and `build-review-fpm` jobs as `environment:action:start` job, which implies that the jobs are supposed to start an environment with deploying new code.\n\nIdeally, since these jobs are just for _prepartion_, it should not be affected by the above features. In other words, these jobs **should run concurrently**.\n\n### Proposal\n\nExpand keywords to `environment:action` to correctly indicate what each job is meant for and annotate jobs that are not resulting in a deployment. \n\n| `environment:action:` | Description | Usage Example |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| `prepare` | The pipeline job is to prepare for a latter deployment stage | Build a docker image for a k8s cluster used as a production environment |\n| `start` | The pipeline job creates/updates an environment. | Updating a production environment by deploying the code |\n| `stop` | The pipeline job stops an environment. | Terminates a review app by destroying VM|\n\n**Important Note**.\n- Jobs with `action:prepare` shouldn't be affected by [Concurrency Limit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#resource_group) or [Skip outdated deployment jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs), since it doesn't modify an environment at all.\n- If `environment:action:` is not specified, `action:start` is selected by default.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yml\napprove:\n  stage: approve\n  script: echo\n  environment:\n    name: production\n    url: https://example.com\n    action: prepare                    # Annotation that this is not a deployment job\n  when: manual\n  allow_failure: false\n```\n\n```yaml\nbuild-review-nginx:\n  script: build_nginx\n  environment:\n    name: review\n    action: prepare                    # Annotation that this is not a deployment job\n\nbuild-review-fpm:\n  script: build_fpm\n  environment:\n    name: review\n    action: prepare                    # Annotation that this is not a deployment

POC | Present Geo Replicables in a \"single\" view","description":"### Requirements\n\n* [x]  UI in a more generalized state: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208470#proposal\n* [ ]  GraphQL API that supports blobs and repositories: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2525#proposal\n\n### What and Why\n\nWith the introduction of Geo Self-Service, we will begin to have too many data types to continue to create new \"views\" for each time they are introduced.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk and thought about **how** we can represent important replication information to the users, outside of our typical paginated listing of each data type.\n\nExample of current Geo Replication listing:\n![Screen_Shot_2020-02-28_at_1.37.33_PM](/uploads/6b7e6b269f3a14e173aed2681383b5dc/Screen_Shot_2020-02-28_at_1.37.33_PM.png)\n\nIn opening this issue, my goal is to get all our thoughts in one place to reference as we works towards this end goal.\n\nFrom conversations I've had with different team members, I have a few key takeaways:\n*  This new view should call higher attention to \"non-synced\" items.\n*  Non-synced items should have actionable items on them to help resolve their issues.\n*  Forever expanding the side-nav is not feasible.\n\n@sunjungp had an amazing [sketching activity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/geo-team/discussions/issues/4944) that helps showcase some of our teams ideas as to what this view may look like.\n\n### Proposal\n\n*  Continue gathering data from our key stakeholders around how they _want_ to interact with Geo\n*  As we fledge out Geo Self Service, begin to think about how we can best represent **all** replicable data as well as what is the **most** important to know about the replicable data.\n*  When we are ready, start converting the existing views of Replicable Data (Designs, Projects, Uploads, etc...) into this new Generalized view of all replicable data.\n\n\n### What does success look like?\n\n*  Generalized view that supports existing (and new) functionality for **all** replicable data types.\n*  No longer need to do any additional frontend coding to expose a **new** replicable data type\n*  Users understand why something is failing to sync and what they need to do to fix it in the UI\n\ncc:

Some ideas around that can be found here on the [Geo Team Sketching Activity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/geo-team/discussions/issues/4944) as well as on the [Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208475) tracking the effort.\n\n### Intended users\n\n*  [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Proposal\n\n*  Generalize the Designs UI to support different replication types\n    *  [Code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/geo_designs)\n    *  URL: `{gitlab_domain}/admin/geo/designs`\n*  Implement a new route (`{gitlab_domain}/admin/geo/package-files`) and sidebar link (`Admin -\u003e Geo -\u003e Package Files`)\n    *  Utilize Generalized Component(s) above to display both Designs and Package Files respectively\n\n\n### What does success look like?\n\n*  Generalized component is created to allow for future data types to be added if necessary\n*  Geo Designs is hooked up to Generalized component but functionality does not change\n*  Geo Package Files is hooked up to Generalized component and works as expected\n\ncc: @mkozono @fzimmer @rnienaber","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-28T19:24:18.180Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T12:44:05.180Z","closed_at":"2020-06-23T14:33:46.693Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Geo Administration","devops::systems","frontend","group::geo","javascript","missed-deliverable","missed:12.10","missed:13.1","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"}],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208470","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":1},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208470","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208470/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208470/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208470","relative":"#208470","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208470"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2346,"epic":{"id":16453,"iid":2346,"title":"Geo: Self Service Framework - First Implementation for Package File replication","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2346","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31394534,"iid":208459,"project_id":278964,"title":"Value Stream Analytics load spinner displayed off-center","description":"### Summary\n\nOn the Value Stream Analytics feature, at the instance and group levels, the spinner that appears when selecting a group or project is displayed off-center so there is insufficient whitespace around it.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

without parent group permission cannot assign epic to issue.","description":"### Summary\n\nA user without permission in the group but with permission in the project, cannot assign epic to issue.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a group **G**\n2. Create a project **P**\n3. Add an epic (**E**) to **G**\n4. Add a user (**U**) as a member of **P**\n5. Open an issue (**I**) in **P**\n6. After the **I** is open, verify that **E** shows up in the epic drop-down (edit)\n7. Try assigning **E** to **I**\n\n### Example Project\n\nNo can do without paying for Epics here.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAssigning/removing an epic form a group the user doesn't have permissions to a project (inside said group) the user has permission results in an error.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe user should be able to assign the issue to its project's parent group epic. The user can already see the epic regardless of not having access to the group (what makes sense).\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screenshot__6_](/uploads/e27bc4632f1bd6585d2ec6a6f45cedd2/Screenshot__6_.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nUnable to try.

look further into the `TodosDestroyer` workers, and service classes under `Todos::Destroy` as it's possible we could follow similar patterns.\n\nThe solution might be:\n* add a new `Todos::Destroy::ArchiveDesign` (or something similar) service, similar to e.g. `Todos::Destroy::ConfidentialIssueService`\n* when a design is soft-deleted, schedule an async job which runs the `Todos::Destroy::ArchiveDesign` - depending whether a design can be un-archived again, we may want to schedule this with a delay or

Learn more.` (Make metrics dashboard lower-case and add a period after learn more)\n- Update green save changes button to blue one.\n\n### **Grafana authentication**\n\n- Add a label to the checkbox to make it consistent with the error tracking checkbox presentation: ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-29_at_10.44.47_AM](/uploads/c0fa94e67fecce6608450132a4a8012b/Screen_Shot_2021-04-29_at_10.44.47_AM.png)\n\n- Update API field help text: ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-29_at_10.43.55_AM](/uploads/e8f05e3fb1f06b7c72abb02f791ad520/Screen_Shot_2021-04-29_at_10.43.55_AM.png)\n\n- Save changes button should be primary rather than success variant\n\n### **Jaeger tracing**\n\n- Change section to be called `Tracing` to match main nav\n- Update help text to: Embed an image of your existing Jaeger server in GitLab. Learn more.\n- It seems like the current empty state and docs page for this feature are out-of-date. Since those changes are outside of the Settings \u003e Operations, this could be tackled separately: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329563\n\n### **Status page**\n\n- Change help text

Jira Issues MVC","description":"### Release Notes\n\n```\nfeatures:\n  primary:\n    - name: \"Import Jira issues into GitLab\"\n      available_in: [starter, premium, ultimate]\n      documentation_link: ''\n      image_url: ''\n      reporter: kokeefe\n      stage: plan\n      categories:\n        - 'Issue Tracking'\n      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208315'\n      description: |\n        Migrating from Jira to GitLab has never been easier. Now you can import issues from your Jira project directly to your GitLab project. \n```\n\n### Proposal\n\n* For each JIRA issue in the JIRA project, create a corresponding issue in the GitLab project, with these mappings:\n  * JIRA issue summary -\u003e GitLab issue title\n  * JIRA issue description -\u003e GitLab issue description\n    * Simplified text handling/conversion\n  * GitLab issue author := GitLab user who activates this import process.\n  * Add import meta-data (timestamp, original author, Jira issue Key, etc.) to newly created GitLab issue (append to description or add comment)\n* All other fields and attributes in the GitLab issue are set to as if it was created in the GitLab web UI with nothing beyond the above selected. E.g. the issue is in open state and there are no labels associated\n\n### Important\n\nThis will be the first of several \"plan\" specific importers we will need to build in the foreseeable future. I would architect this in a somewhat generic manner where the core import logic is somewhat isolated and we use vendor specific adapters to extend the base service. No need to over-engineer, but it is worth keeping in mind...\n\n### Implementation details\n\n- This should support both Jira Server and Jira Cloud APIs\n- User will be required to provide their Jira email address, API token, instance URL, and ID or project key. The key is [case sensitive](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-get)\n  * They must have `Browse` Project permissions and `Read` App permissions in the Jira project they want to import\n- User must be a GitLab admin or owner\n- Importing can be initiated when creating a project or via an existing project (~\"group::import\" to define where this ought to be located)\n\n### Implementation Breakdown\n\u003e I don't think we need to use the REST API. We will be running these in Sidekiq and those have access to the whole Rails app. So we could create service classes to do this like we do in `lib/gitlab/github_import/importer/issue_importer.rb`. That would save us some overhead of another HTTP call. Also, just wanted to add that we already have the `jira-ruby` gem installed. And we could use that to access Jira's REST API. \n\nFull Notes: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208315#note_296151907\n\n- [ ] 1. Entry point experience -- direct to setup Jira Service Integration if not already configured\n- [ ] 2.1 Use installed `jira-ruby` gem to access REST API to pull issues (handle pagination -- currently 100 issues per page)  \n- [ ] 2.2 Parse data and map it to a GitLab like data structure.\n- [ ] 2.3 Make use of Sidekiq / service classes to create the issues\n- [ ] 2.4 Provide some status update mechanism on the progress of the import process\n- [ ] 3. [Update usage ping to collect usage metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/feature-instrumentation/#usage-ping)\n\nEach of these tasks can be worked independently and at the same time with some overlap of 1 and 2.4 if we would store credentials in the same `jira_issue_imports` table\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n- `Admin` or `Owner` only\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- Yes, we will need documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n- We will need to write an end-to-end integration test that verifies Jira API compatibility at all times. i.e. if the Jira API changes, we should fail the build because there is a potential it will break this feature.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n#### Success Metrics\n\nWe should track the following usage metrics:\n- Count of the number of times the importer is used\n- Count of issues imported via the Jira importer\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The proposal is satisfied\n- [ ] Documentation\n- [ ] Use GitLab-UI\n- [ ] [Usage ping updated to collect usage metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/feature-instrumentation/#usage-ping)\n- [ ] Tests sufficiently implemented to prevent feature failure due to changes in external APIs we do not control\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n- For this initial MVC, we are targeting ~\"GitLab Starter\". As we iterate to support importing epics, this will branch into different tiers such as ~\"GitLab Premium\" \n\n### Working UX\n\n![Jira Import](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/uploads/8a4baf18d44ed3696a761dc96580d6c0/Jira_Import.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-27T16:56:11.281Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T16:13:30.495Z","closed_at":"2020-03-04T11:11:06.985Z","closed_by":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"},"labels":["CEO Interest","Category:Jira Importer","Kickoff Highlight","devops::plan","direction","documentation","group::project management","highlight","planning priority","quad-planning::complete-action","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":4478389,"username":"kokeefe","name":"Keanon O'Keefe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4478389/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kokeefe"}],"author":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4478389,"username":"kokeefe","name":"Keanon O'Keefe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4478389/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kokeefe"},"user_notes_count":47,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208315","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":11,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 11 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208315","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208315/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208315/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208315","relative":"#208315","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208315"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2738,"epic":{"id":24595,"iid":2738,"title":"JIRA Importer","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2738","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 22, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31345594,"iid":208303,"project_id":278964,"title":"Issues associated with epics are not shown on Epic's page after Project Import","description":"If a project is imported into a group, that has epics and project's issue are referencing that epic - on Epic's Page issue list is empty.

Swap the expand up/down buttons so that “show more lines above” appears first, on the left. In the image below, notice that the first button is pointing down.

With that improvement, it will be safe for any instance running the GitLab's Container Registry to enable existing projects without having to worry about overloading the background cleanup jobs. \n\n#### Self-managed instances using an external container registry\nFor self-managed instances not running the GitLab container registry, they can enable at their own risk, using the [application setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208735). Then once [throttling](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208193) is added, the setting can be removed entirely and all projects can have policies regardless of when they were created without worry.\n\n### Proposal\nFor both self-managed instances AND GitLab.com, enable by default, the Docker tag expiration policies for all new projects, 12.8 forward.  \n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this issue.\n\n### Documentation\n- There are no documentation changes required for this change.\n\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-27T08:51:49.368Z","updated_at":"2022-11-26T01:47:02.652Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T15:01:32.264Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve

raw (full-size) Design Management design image. \n\nBecause the old route was exposed in the REST and GraphQL APIs, a redirection from the old route to the new route was added in order to support any clients that had cached the old route, or otherwise were referring to the old route. \n\nThis redirection should be removed in 13.0, which due to being a major release, allows us to make breaking changes.\n\nBefore we make this change, check our logs to see if the deprecated URI has been accessed. We can make a decision then about whether this URI is being accessed on GitLab.com, and whether that influences our decision to remove it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-27T03:28:37.757Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:58:50.547Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T23:07:52.083Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke

Dependency Scanning template to allow air-gapped (offline) usage for on-prem instances","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe [Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml template file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ea41f94523184072c10b44d2224bdd1094700a2e/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L65) currently hardcodes the dependency scanning Docker image to the GitLab container registry:\n\n```\ndocker run \\\n...\n  \"registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependency-scanning:$DS_VERSION\" /code\n```\n\nThis means that it's not possible to use Dependency Scanning in an air-gapped (offline) on-prem instance, because the template will always attempt to fetch the Docker image from the remote GitLab container registry at `registry.gitlab.com`.\n\nIn order to support air-gapped (offline) usage, we need to update the [Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml template file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ea41f94523184072c10b44d2224bdd1094700a2e/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L65) so that the location of this Docker image can be overridden by a variable.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nThis change is necessary to allow Dependency Scanning to operate in an air-gapped (offline) installation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a new variable `SECURITY_SCANNER_IMAGE_PREFIX` to the [Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml template file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ea41f94523184072c10b44d2224bdd1094700a2e/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L65) to allow overriding the location of the Dependency Scanning Docker container:\n\n```yaml\nvariables:\n  SECURITY_SCANNER_IMAGE_PREFIX: \"registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products\"\n  DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX: \"$SECURITY_SCANNER_IMAGE_PREFIX/analyzers\"\n\ndocker run \\\n  $(propagate_env_vars \\\n    DS_ANALYZER_IMAGES \\\n    ...\n    BUNDLER_AUDIT_ADVISORY_DB_REF_NAME \\\n  ) \\\n  --volume \"$PWD:/code\" \\\n  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  \"$SECURITY_SCANNER_IMAGE_PREFIX/dependency-scanning:$DS_VERSION\" /code\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation will be handled separately\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nAfter this change, we should be able to run the Dependency Scanning job using a Dependency Scanning image hosted on a local Docker container registry.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"Enterprise Edition\" \n\n### Links /

This happens on the \"non-link\" versions of labels because `:last-child` here would actually be the doc link.

If we find that `renderGFM` is being called on the Release description, then we may be inadvertently removing the styles somewhere, and will need to fix the regression.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-26T13:08:34.451Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T08:37:01.283Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T22:36:20.201Z","closed_by":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P1","UX","UX debt","cicd::active","devops::release","frontend","frontend-weight::1","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":4446737,"username":"jakeburden","name":"Jake Burden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4446737/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jakeburden"}],"author":{"id":5342457,"username":"sanjuroo","name":"sanjuroo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e10373f9b583d9d61cab790fafb6600?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sanjuroo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4446737,"username":"jakeburden","name":"Jake Burden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4446737/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jakeburden"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208148","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208148","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208148/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208148/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208148","relative":"#208148","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208148"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3416,"epic":{"id":59432,"iid":3416,"title":"Release Management UX Debt \u0026 UI Polish","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3416","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31289074,"iid":208147,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group Level Wiki: BE Support Geo replication","description":"In ~\"group::knowledge\" we've started to work on group wikis for 12.9 (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/240). There's no timeline on the release yet, but we'll keep it behind a feature flag until it's ready and currently expect that to take a few months.\n\nI saw https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/121589, so I wanted to raise a similar issue for group wikis to discuss any potential challenges with Geo support.\n\nSo far we know:\n\n- Each group can have one wiki repository.\n  - We haven't settled on a path format yet, @brodock suggested going with `@groups/#{hashed_path}/#{hashed_id}.wiki.git` at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/196053#note_294529826.\n- This is the first repository type on groups.\n  - Other types that we might add in the future are design management repos.\n\n## Activity columns for Geo\n\nFor project wikis, we're updating the `projects.last_repository_updated_at` column both synchronously for changes made through GitLab itself (via web UI or API), as well as a second time asynchronously for all changes made to the wiki repository (via the post-receive hook). This column indicates to Geo that the repository needs to be replicated, though we're also throttling updates to this column in certain cases.\n\nFor group wikis we need to check if we need a similar signaling mechanism for Geo, and we could also consider removing the first synchronous update because we're already doing it in the asynchronous call.\n\nSee discussions at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37439/diffs#note_405488754 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37439/diffs#note_406180066.\n\n/cc @toon @dsatcher","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-26T12:57:14.147Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T13:36:30.234Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T06:36:42.727Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","Category:Wiki","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","GitLab Starter","devops::systems","group::editor","section::enablement","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208147","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208147","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208147/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/208147/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#208147","relative":"#208147","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#208147"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2782,"epic":{"id":26783,"iid":2782,"title":"[MVC 2] Group-level wiki: Feature parity with project wikis (git, search)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2782","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31282930,"iid":208132,"project_id":278964,"title":"Auto Deploy to ECS (via Auto DevOps)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nAfter we deliver https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/207962, it would make it easier for us to apply this template for users deploying to AWS.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\nUsers deploying to AWS ECS\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nOur options are as follows:\n* adding this logic into the existing auto deploy template (which will become very long)\n* Creating a new Auto Deploy to ECS template that will be called from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml as an include\n* Refactoring the Auto Deploy template - to cut it into a new template called `auto deploy to Kubernetes` and create an `auto deploy to ECS `and have both of those called from the auto deploy template with an include (similar to the way Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml works)\n\n\nIn the future there will also be auto_Deploy to more cloud vendors, so the preferred choice would be to create individual templates that wiykd be called by include from the AutoDeploy template (also avoiding renaming it)\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nIf a user has defined the following CI/CD variables\n* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\n* AWS_ACCOUNT_ID\n* AWS_REGION\n\nthen the [autoDeploy template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/207962) will be initiated from autoDevOps\n\nIn the existing AutoDeploy template there is `kubernetes: active` we would need to except: kubernetes\n\nUse cases:\n\n* We need to make sure that if the user is using Kubernetes - the regular auto DevOps template is initiated.\n* If a user is not using Kubernetes, and is deploying to AWS, this new auto-deploy-to-ECS is initiated \n* If a user is not using Kubernetes and not using AWS, both templates are skipped\n* If a user is using Kubernetes and deploying to AWS - Only run the deploy Kubernetes template\n\nThis may involve a new behind the scenes type for variables called AWS (we will probably also have in the future GCP, Azure and maybe others) \n\nNote: We may need to change the existing auto DevOps template (for K8s) and make it into Auto_Deploy_Kubernetes. yml that will be called by an include from the auto Deploy yml\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

The issue is that GitLab is looking for the blob on local storage when it actually exists in object storage. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\nThanks to @anton for documenting two methods to reproducing this bug:\n\n**Method 1: Via `.gitlab-ci.yml`**\n\n1. Enable object storage for dependency proxies using the below:\n\n   ```ruby\n   gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_enabled'] = true\n   gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_enabled'] = true\n   gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_direct_upload'] = true\n   gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_background_upload'] = false\n   gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_remote_directory'] = \"xxxxxxx\"\n   gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_connection'] = {\n      'provider' =\u003e 'AWS',\n      'region' =\u003e 'ap-southeast-2',\n      'aws_access_key_id' =\u003e 'xxxxxxxx',\n      'aws_secret_access_key' =\u003e 'xxxxxxx',\n   }\n   ```\n1. Create a project, with the following inside the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:\n\n   ```yaml\n   build:\n     image: gitlab.tld/group/dependency_proxy/containers/alpine:latest\n     stage: build\n   script:\n      - echo \"Deploy complete\"\n   ```\n1. Observe that the job completes successfully. At this point, if I check S3, the blobs exist there, and they aren't in local storage.\n\n   ```\n   [0KRunning with gitlab-runner 13.0.0 (c127439c)\n   [0;m[0K  on antons-runner-docker vDxnAt5P\n   [0;msection_start:1591157011:prepare_executor\n   [0K[0K[36;1mPreparing the \"docker\" executor[0;m\n   [0;m[0KUsing Docker executor with image gitlab.tld/group/dependency_proxy/containers/alpine:latest ...\n   [0;m[0KPulling docker image gitlab.tld/group/dependency_proxy/containers/alpine:latest ...\n   [0;m[0KUsing docker image sha256:a24bb4013296f61e89ba57005a7b3e52274d8edd3ae2077d04395f806b63d83e for gitlab.tld/group/dependency_proxy/containers/alpine:latest ...\n   [0;msection_end:1591157021:prepare_executor\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157021:prepare_script\n   [0K[0K[36;1mPreparing environment[0;m\n   [0;mRunning on runner-vdxnat5p-project-246-concurrent-0 via antons-runner01...\n   section_end:1591157023:prepare_script\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157023:get_sources\n   [0K[0K[36;1mGetting source from Git repository[0;m\n   [0;m[32;1mFetching changes with git depth set to 50...[0;m\n   Reinitialized existing Git repository in /builds/group/alpine/.git/\n   From https://gitlab.tld/group/alpine\n   * [new ref]         refs/pipelines/213 -\u003e refs/pipelines/213\n   43e4457..ae7caf0  master             -\u003e origin/master\n   [32;1mChecking out ae7caf0d as master...[0;m\n   \n   [32;1mSkipping Git submodules setup[0;m\n   section_end:1591157024:get_sources\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157024:restore_cache\n   [0K[0K[36;1mRestoring cache[0;m\n   [0;msection_end:1591157026:restore_cache\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157026:download_artifacts\n   [0K[0K[36;1mDownloading artifacts[0;m\n   [0;msection_end:1591157027:download_artifacts\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157027:build_script\n   [0K[0K[36;1mRunning before_script and script[0;m\n   [0;m[32;1m$ echo \"Deploy complete\"[0;m\n   Deploy complete\n   section_end:1591157029:build_script\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157029:after_script\n   [0K[0K[36;1mRunning after_script[0;m\n   [0;msection_end:1591157031:after_script\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157031:archive_cache\n   [0K[0K[36;1mSaving cache[0;m\n   [0;msection_end:1591157033:archive_cache\n   [0Ksection_start:1591157033:upload_artifacts_on_success\n   [0K[0K[36;1mUploading artifacts for successful job[0;m\n   [0;msection_end:1591157035:upload_artifacts_on_success\n   [0K[32;1mJob succeeded\n   [0;m\n   ```\n1.

I think this predates the notion of \"trigger\" jobs. Instead of `pipeline.builds` we should use `pipeline.processables` to include everything. I'm not sure this classifies as ~bug if it was a miss or a ~feature if we had a reason for only returning runnable jobs.\n* on not serializing created child-pipelines: we should definitely render them and perhaps even inside the \"trigger\" jobs (currently missed) so it will be clear which job triggered which child pipeline.\n\n:point_up: this could probably be an issue on its own and it's more complicated: for `/pipelines/:id/jobs` we are using specific preloads and serializer for `Ci::Build`. This won't directly apply to `Ci::Bridge` jobs. We could create a new API endpoint `GET /pipelines/:id/bridges` that instead returns only bridge jobs. This means we could serialize them differently than `Ci::Build` and even include a reference to the downstream pipeline.\n\nOtherwise a more complex solution would be to reuse `GET /pipelines/:id/jobs` and return a list of processables that can be either `Ci::Build` or `Ci::Bridge`. This is like returning polymorphic associations which has a set of complications (e.g. preloading `:job_artifacts` won't work on `Ci::Processable`). I'm not sure we do that or discourage it. - cc @ayufan ?\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe could create a new API endpoint `GET /pipelines/:id/bridges` that instead returns only bridge jobs.

As a consequence, deployments / builds are possible even if tests are failing.\n\nIn a stage-based pipeline where `deploy-job` is supposed to depend on `test-job` based on the implicit stage dependencies, it's still possible to retry the `deploy-job` if you cancel it while the `test-job` is running. Retrying the `deploy-job` in this case will simply insert it into the running queue disregarding the status of the `test-job`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Have a pipeline similar to this:\n```\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  script:\n    - # Tests are running here\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - # Building and deploying to production\n```\n2. While the test job runs, cancel the deploy job.\n3. Now click \"retry\" on deploy job\n4. The job is directly picked by a runner.\n    - If `dependencies` were set, the job does fail due to missing dependencies. This is ugly but not a dramatic failure\n    - If no dependencies were set, the job just runs trough. This is dramatic\n\n**This can not only happen if you are a rouge user but also inadvertently, e.g. you accidentally cancelled a job and then want to have it back in the pipeline.**\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis CI: https://gitlab.com/PhilLab/testing-private/-/blob/a6514903e34322dc92319fec4fad33e66b3c2259/.gitlab-ci.yml\nLeads to a successful deployment even though the tests failed:\n- https://gitlab.com/PhilLab/testing-private/pipelines/120920659\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nStages which are meant to block subsequent procedures can be jumped over. When a job is restarted, it is not respecting the sequence of stages and waiting to execute only when jobs in the preceding stages have successfully completed.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nRetrying the job should not directly start it but insert it back into the usual processing queue.\n\nExpected behavior as noted in the [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/index.html#cicd-pipelines):\n- **If _all_ jobs in a stage succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage.**\n- **If _any_ job in a stage fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed and the pipeline ends early**\n\n## Proposal\n\nsolve the problem in the ~backend by not enqueueing the job directly and use `Ci::ProcessPipelineService` which will look at the whole pipeline. If the `deploy` job meets the dependencies it will run, otherwise it will remain in `created` state until the `test` job completes. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352858\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83730/diffs#note_915332037 we discussed that we should use `Ci::PipelineCreation::StartPipelineService` (to be renamed to `Ci::Pipelines::StartService`) since this service creates a persistent ref (pipeline run prerequisites) and runs `Ci::ProcessPipelineService`. \n\nIn fact, we should use `StartPipelineService` not only in `PlayBuildService` but also in `RetryJobService` and `RetryPipelineService`. Basically any time we resume the pipeline execution.\n\nOnce we do that we should also remove the creation of `persistent_ref` in `Ci::Build` state transition since the `persistent_ref` will be consistently created when we start/resume the pipeline execution and deleted when the pipeline completes.\n\n**Can the same bug exist also with scheduled jobs (`when: delayed`)?**. If so, we would need to run `StartPipelineService` also in `Ci::RunScheduledBuildService`.\n\n\u003c!--- #### User experience specs\n\n When the user clicks \"Retry\" we will show the job in `pending` status until we get the response from BE. If the job cannot be run due to unmet dependencies, we bring the job to its previous status and throw an error. If it can be run, it goes into `running` status.\n- The alert should appear above the pipeline graph if the job is retried from the pipeline graph, and as the page-level alert on any other page where the job can be retried (job page, pipelines list page, MR page, etc.)\n- Error alert text: `[job-name] can't be retried because earlier required jobs have not completed successfully yet.`\n- The error alert should be placed above the pipeline graph and it should be dismissible. ---\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible related issues\n\nI can't link to fixes, but the fix might be in the same realm as some of the other retry bugs:\n- gitlab-org/gitlab#32712\n- gitlab-org/gitlab#37268\n- gitlab-org/gitlab#25321\n- gitlab-org/gitlab#31367\n\n### Testing Consideration\n\nIn terms of testing, let's include a test in the integration level with the FE to test this exact scenario.\n\n1. Create a pipeline with 2 stages.\n2. Run the pipeline.\n3. Cancel the first stage.\n4. Retry the second stage.\n5. Validate that the second stage fails and returns an error.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-25T16:00:02.822Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T01:07:29.897Z","closed_at":"2022-11-23T06:57:02.516Z","closed_by":{"id":12411397,"username":"tianwenchen","name":"Tianwen

Summary\n\nWhen viewing a Snippet, `Banzai::Renderer#render_field` gets called for the Snippet `title` when rendering the header, which in turn [will call](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/banzai/renderer.rb#L42) `CacheMarkdownField#refresh_markdown_cache` if the `:title` cache is not up to date / does not exist.\n\nThe problem with this, is that the refresh method will then attempt to cache **all** fields on the Snippet, including `content` and treating them as if they're markdown, which is not always the case. \n\nThis means that we are needlessly processing and caching non-markdown content but also causing errors when passing large non-markdown fields to CommonMarker for parsing (see: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/204894), and the `content_html` field is not even being used when rendering non-markdown Snippets.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a new snippet with a non-markdown filename, e.g. `my_snippet.rb`\n- View the snippet's `content_html` in DB or rails-console to confirm it was cached, e.g.\n```\u003cp data-sourcepos=\"1:1-1:13\" dir=\"auto\"\u003etest ruby file\u003c/p\u003e```\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`Snippet.content_html` is populated for non-markdown Snippets\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`Snippet.content_html` should not be populated for non-markdown Snippets\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n[`Banzai::Renderer#render_field`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/banzai/renderer.rb#L37) could change to check if the `object` **should** be cached due to it's content, rather than just whether or not it responds to `cached_markdown_fields` and cache is up to date. \n\nWe could add a helper method e.g. `is_markdown_file?` that checks for `object.file_name` and it's file extension, to determine whether or not it is actually [intended to be markdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/markup_helper.rb#L7).\n\nWe should probably also ensure that if the file extension changes from markdown to something else, we clear the cached fields to avoid future confusion.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-25T14:31:53.861Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T15:26:17.944Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T15:26:17.839Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay

TODO - we need to ask the Configure team how they manage these kinds of container dependencies between containers and templates within Auto DevOps and do it the same way.\n\nThis iteration assumes a pre-existing cluster, we don't create one on the fly for them.

TODO - add what we with digest here.\n  * Create AWS Task to be used for the Docker deploy \n  * Register AWS Task definition with the ECS cluster\n  * Grab revision # of the Task definition using regular bash and grep\n  * Deploy revision using the Docker deploy\n* [ ] Documentation \n\n*Main variables to modify for your account* (for reference see [here](https://github.com/ricktbaker/docker-circleci-ecr-ecs/blob/master/deploy.sh))\n\n* `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n* `REGION`='us-east-1'\n* `CLUSTER`='test-app'\n* `FAMILY`='test-app'\n* `DOCKER_IMAGE`='test-app'\n* `TASK`='test-app'\n* `SERVICE`='app-service\n\n*Secrets needed: *\n* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\n* AWS_ACCOUNT_ID\n* AWS_REGION\n\n#### Reference\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nWe will use Gitlab's container registry and not Amazon ECR.\n\nYou'll then need to setup ECS.\n\nAn ECS cluster \n\nA Task Definition - variable in the yml [here](https://github.com/ricktbaker/docker-circleci-ecr-ecs/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)\n\nA Service within the cluster - variable in the yml [here](https://github.com/ricktbaker/docker-circleci-ecr-ecs/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)\n\nSee the [EC2 Container Service Resources Page](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) if you need more help on the above.\n\nYou'll need AWS credentials for the step below that have access to ECS.\n\n![image](/uploads/0ef7043e4c3d1d394fd11baa6013fcac/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/546adb5b8aadab311d1dcc6b94cc5f08/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/6f30a0e4e5f2815877eeabd6e4352025/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/940bc053055acb16bdb7ef5bf56c32af/image.png)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n(for testing we will use: auto build, auto test and add to that auto deploy to ECS)\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nWe need to measure the amount of times that this template is used\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n* https://github.com/ricktbaker/docker-circleci-ecr-ecs/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates\n* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-25T11:51:59.973Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T23:10:24.740Z","closed_at":"2020-03-23T13:52:52.304Z","closed_by":{"id":5211906,"username":"csouthard","name":"Chase Southard","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5e2adecb9fa1d32cf007754824aa358f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/csouthard"},"labels":["Alliances - AWS","Category:Continuous Delivery","Deliverable","Release::P1","cicd::active","devops::release","direction","group::release","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"user_notes_count":55,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207962","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207962","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207962/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207962/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207962","relative":"#207962","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207962"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2351,"epic":{"id":16529,"iid":2351,"title":"Streamline AWS Deployments","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2351","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31244075,"iid":207959,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make json-type artifact available in A11y jobs","description":"### Summary\n\nTo support the Accessiblity MR widget in 12.10 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39425, we need to make pa11y data available in JSON as a CI job artifact.

does not consider `save_on_errors: true`","description":"The current code of `Ci::CreatePipelineService#execute!` method checks if a pipeline is persisted. If so, it considers it valid, otherwise it raises a `CreateError`.\n\n```ruby\ndef execute!(*args, \u0026block)\n  execute(*args, \u0026block).tap do |pipeline|\n    unless pipeline.persisted?\n      raise CreateError, pipeline.error_messages\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis logic is not always correct, quite the opposite. By default we use in `save_on_errors: true` which always saves a pipeline, even if it's \"invalid\" (with errors during the creation phase). Checking if a pipeline is persisted only makes sense if using `save_on_errors: false`.\n\nI think we should remove this method entirely and change the code in the only place where it's used today: [`RunPipelineScheduleWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/88595ff1d32c56162725c9310535ab187ad7cc4b/app/workers/run_pipeline_schedule_worker.rb#L22-27) and `Git::BaseHookService`\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eDiff to apply (excluding specs to fix):\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/services/ci/create_pipeline_service.rb b/app/services/ci/create_pipeline_service.rb\nindex d53e136effb..16f189a3e4c 100644\n--- a/app/services/ci/create_pipeline_service.rb\n+++ b/app/services/ci/create_pipeline_service.rb\n@@ -4,8 +4,6 @@ module Ci\n   class CreatePipelineService \u003c BaseService\n     attr_reader :pipeline, :logger\n\n-    CreateError = Class.new(StandardError)\n-\n     LOG_MAX_DURATION_THRESHOLD = 3.seconds\n     LOG_MAX_PIPELINE_SIZE = 2_000\n     LOG_MAX_CREATION_THRESHOLD = 20.seconds\n@@ -116,17 +114,6 @@ def execute(source, ignore_skip_ci: false, save_on_errors: true, trigger_request\n     end\n     # rubocop: enable Metrics/ParameterLists\n\n-    def execute!(*args, \u0026block)\n-      source = args[0]\n-      params = Hash(args[1])\n-\n-      execute(source, **params, \u0026block).tap do |response|\n-        unless response.payload.persisted?\n-          raise CreateError, pipeline.full_error_messages\n-        end\n-      end\n-    end\n-\n     private\n\n     def commit\ndiff --git a/app/services/git/base_hooks_service.rb b/app/services/git/base_hooks_service.rb\nindex 63f3f73905a..a4687402637 100644\n--- a/app/services/git/base_hooks_service.rb\n+++ b/app/services/git/base_hooks_service.rb\n@@ -53,11 +53,11 @@ def create_events\n     def create_pipelines\n       return unless params.fetch(:create_pipelines, true)\n\n-      Ci::CreatePipelineService\n+      response = Ci::CreatePipelineService\n         .new(project, current_user, pipeline_params)\n-        .execute!(:push, pipeline_options)\n-    rescue Ci::CreatePipelineService::CreateError =\u003e ex\n-      log_pipeline_errors(ex)\n+        .execute(:push, pipeline_options)\n+\n+      log_pipeline_errors(response.message) if response.error?\n     end\n\n     def execute_project_hooks\n@@ -148,14 +148,14 @@ def pipeline_options\n       {}\n     end\n\n-    def log_pipeline_errors(exception)\n+    def log_pipeline_errors(error_message)\n       data = {\n         class: self.class.name,\n         correlation_id: Labkit::Correlation::CorrelationId.current_id.to_s,\n         project_id: project.id,\n         project_path: project.full_path,\n         message: \"Error creating pipeline\",\n-        errors: exception.to_s,\n+        errors: error_message,\n         pipeline_params: sanitized_pipeline_params\n       }\n\ndiff --git a/app/workers/run_pipeline_schedule_worker.rb b/app/workers/run_pipeline_schedule_worker.rb\nindex 35e3e633c70..31cf13b8a8b 100644\n--- a/app/workers/run_pipeline_schedule_worker.rb\n+++ b/app/workers/run_pipeline_schedule_worker.rb\n@@ -21,13 +21,14 @@ def perform(schedule_id, user_id)\n   end\n\n   def run_pipeline_schedule(schedule, user)\n-    Ci::CreatePipelineService.new(schedule.project,\n-                                  user,\n-                                  ref: schedule.ref)\n-      .execute!(:schedule, ignore_skip_ci: true, save_on_errors: false, schedule: schedule)\n-  rescue Ci::CreatePipelineService::CreateError =\u003e e\n-    # This is a user operation error such as corrupted .gitlab-ci.yml.

dependencies of gemnasium-python analyzer cause a flaky requirements list","description":"### Summary\n\n`gemnasium-python` dependency `pipenv` has loose constraints on its downstream dependencies (like `virtualenv`, `setuptools`, and potentially others). Because we get no lockfile when using `requirements.txt` these dependencies get updated each time a new version of the analyzer is built. And because of the way we use `pipdeptree` (see [related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34763)) these extra dependencies show up in the analyzer's report and cause flaky expectations every time `virtualenv` or `setuptools` change. This happens without any change in either `gemnasium-python`'s or the target project's requirements.\n\nSee [this MR's note](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/-/merge_requests/59#note_292605901) for the latest in a series of contributor/maintainer encounters with the issue.\n\n### More detail\n\nCompare the [failing expectation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/-/jobs/446463007) in the pipeline of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/47/diffs against [the passing DS job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/pipelines/119300151) for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/-/merge_requests/57/diffs.\n\nFor the two cases above: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/47/diffs runs against a \"newer\" `gemnasium-python` image (`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/tmp:e472108c9bfce12c69acfc42cc0b82a8804fc89f`) while https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/-/merge_requests/57/diffs runs against the `latest` tagged image: [2.6.0](registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2.6.0).\n\nThe `pip install` happens in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/47/diffs when the [build commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/jobs/446461791) step runs.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce locally, check out the [python-pip](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip) project and run the following:\n```\ndocker run --volume \"$PWD\":/code registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2.6.0 pip list \u003e /tmp/2.6.0\ndocker run --volume \"$PWD\":/code registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/tmp:e472108c9bfce12c69acfc42cc0b82a8804fc89f pip list \u003e /tmp/e47210\ndiff /tmp/e47210 /tmp/2.6.0 \n```\n\nThe diff shows a difference in the versions of the installed dependencies (among them: `virtualenv` and `setuptools` as well as their dependencies).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDependencies like `setuptools`, `virtualenv` are updated.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe dependencies shouldn't change unless explicitly updated in `gemnasium-python` (via the `Dockerfile`).\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe culprit is [this section](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/742ae1b99b335ffb6d83a2240035af739cacafff/setup.py#L24) in `pipenv`. It puts very loose constraints on some of its requirements (i.e. setuptools, virtualenv, etc.)\n\nOptions:\n1. Explicitly pre-install the unspecified dependencies by adding something like the following to [the Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/47f333768c244c3ece69b0fa197dc26b186c1458/Dockerfile#L25): `pip install pipdeptree==0.13.2 virtualenv==16.7.8 setuptools==41.6.0 pipenv==$PIPENV_VERSION` (this is not an optimal fix (see point below) but will reduce/remove the flakiness in python-pip's expectations).\n2. Install `gemnasium-python`'s dependencies in a binary or separate wheel which gets excluded from the report (this is the best fix as it also resolves https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34763, but we still need to validate whether this can be done effectively).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-25T01:08:59.078Z","updated_at":"2021-01-26T11:50:57.649Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T03:05:47.024Z","closed_by":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::2","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"}],"author":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207925","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207925","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207925/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207925/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34763"},"references":{"short":"#207925","relative":"#207925","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207925"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1400,"epic":{"id":7868,"iid":1400,"title":"Improve Dependency Scanning support for Python","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1400","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31220066,"iid":207919,"project_id":278964,"title":"Reporter role unable to view pipeline security tab","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nProject members with the role of `Reporter` are unable to view the security tab of a pipeline even though they're able to view specific jobs in the pipeline.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.
