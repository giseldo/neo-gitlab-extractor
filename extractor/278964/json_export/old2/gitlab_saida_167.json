Only ‘Reporter’ roles and above on tiers Premium / Silver and above can see Productivity Analytics.\"\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n- This was motivated by a [comment in an unrelated MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/17618/#note_229875720).\n- That comment sparked a [conversation in Slack](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJZR6KPB4/p1571056404020700) on 2019-10-15:\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nahegyi Yesterday at 7:33 AM\nquestion regarding to productivity analytics: should we require license for loading the initial HTML page or just for the JSON request? I think we need to enforce license check for the JSON request only.\n\nDan Jensen  1 day ago\n@ahegyi (cc @virjinia) Questions: 1) Is the link to Productivity Analytics visible without a license?  2) Is a user-friendly message displayed in Productivity Analytics if the JSON request fails?\n\nvirjinia  1 day ago\nyes, it's already the case - it already says you don't have access to the tier or the right access level. Do you have in mind something else @ahegyi?\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nSo the idea is to show \"Productivity Analytics\" on the sidebar even if you don't have the license. Verify the license as soon as you select the group.\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nin that case we have a bug, visiting PA page enforces the license availability.\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/controllers/analytics/productivity_analytics_controller.rb#L11\n\nDan Jensen  1 day ago\n@ahegyi related:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33876\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nThanks, but not exactly the same problem. This came up during the CR for code hotspots:\nWhen we render the sidebar (links for analytics features, PA, CA, Code Analytics), we only render the link when the specific feature is enabled. We don't check the license at all.\nWhen the user clicks the link, we do check the license and render 403 if license is missing.\n\nDan Jensen  1 day ago\nthe idea is to show “Productivity Analytics” on the sidebar even if you don’t have the license\nThat’s the spec?  If so then it sounds like we need to handle the 403 more gracefully, is that right?\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nI think so\n\nDan Jensen  1 day ago\n@ahegyi can I write the issue or have you already?\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nit only affects PA, so I guess this could be covered within the PA issues?\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nreally small change\n\nvirjinia  1 day ago\nWell, at some point where this is more stable, we will remove the enabling as well\n\nvirjinia  1 day ago\nSo your idea is just to show everything on the side subject to checking license and having at least 1 group/correct access leve?\n\nvirjinia  1 day ago\nI think we can show everything, but still only check access when you select a group?\n\nahegyi  1 day ago\nok, the fix: disable license check on page load, and do the license check when group is selected\n\nvirjinia  1 day ago\nyes, this is what I thought we are doing, so seems like it's a bug to be fair. I am also happy to make everything visible and remove the flag for Productivity Analytics once the date fix is in. @Dan Jensen - should we do that? We can keep the flag for the scatter still on (edited) \n\nvirjinia  1 day ago\nIs the date fix for productivity analytics going to make it - I thought it's small change, but haven't followed ?

Because all the functionality of the merge request is available while the checks are running, it is possible to exploit the delay to bypass the CODEOWNERS check.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.  You'll need a monorepo with a large amount of activity, where creating a merge request can take several seconds.\n2.  Set up CODEOWNERS to have a sample file owned by somebody else in the project.\n3.  Ensure that CODEOWNERS approvals are required.\n4.  Create a sample change to an owned file on a branch other than master.\n5.  Open a second tab showing the list of merge requests outstanding for approval\n6.  Create the merge request, then switch over to the second tab and refresh until it appears.\n7.  If the conditions are correct, you'll be able to approve the request before the CODENWERS check has been completed.\n8.  The end result is a merged merge request with 0/1 CODEOWNERS approvals.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPeople are able to bypass the CODENWERS check to merge changes to owned files without the approval of the code owners.\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMerge requests should not have functionalities enabled until certain checks have been completed, CODEOWNERS is one of them. I would expect to see the 'Merge' button disabled, with some form of indication that the MR is still being processed or created. Once everything has been assessed, we should then be able to proceed with actions.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n![Screenshot_2019-10-14_at_08.21.20](/uploads/3f50df6d85cd89bef4d83fc520f0969e/Screenshot_2019-10-14_at_08.21.20.png)\n\nThe author of the merge is not an owner, but is still able to merge without their approval under the circumstances described above.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-14T06:20:05.559Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T16:48:12.127Z","closed_at":"2019-12-14T01:48:15.317Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","approvals","backend","customer","devops::create","group::code review","merge requests","planning priority","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"}],"author":{"id":3620402,"username":"zane.wright","name":"Zane Wright","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1dc26136b8d8398152c700cba75e37e8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zane.wright"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33998","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33998","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33998/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33998/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33998","relative":"#33998","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33998"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":306,"epic":{"id":661,"iid":306,"title":"Code owners enhancements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/306","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25869301,"iid":33943,"project_id":278964,"title":"When two_step_rebase is enabled, rebases that take longer than idle_in_transaction_session_timeout will fail","description":"### Summary\n\nHighly diverged branches on large repositories can take several minutes to rebase.  However, when using `two_step_rebase` the rebase must finish before the `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`  limit (60 seconds by default in Omnibus) or Postgres will cancel the transaction.  As a result, rebases on very large projects can consistently fail.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n  1. Clone a large project such as the Linux kernel\n  1. Set `Merge method` to `Merge commit with semi-linear history` or `Fast-forward merge` under `Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Merge requests -\u003e Merge method`\n  1. Checkout an older tag such as `v2.6.28`, old enough that rebasing will take greater than 60 seconds\n  1. Create a new branch and make a change\n  1. Make a change on master\n  1. Create an MR using the new branch\n  1. Click rebase\n  1. Eventually a `Fast-forward merge is not possible` message will be shown in the UI, in the background the `RebaseWorker` job has failed\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nLarge rebases fail

A longer timeout for the transaction, ideally configurable by admins, would work around this issue.\n\nThe `RebaseWorker` will start the DB transaction, then execute the `UserRebaseConfirmable` Gitaly RPC.  However, when the rebase takes over 60 seconds PG releases the lock and closes the connection while the `RebaseWorker` continues to wait for Gitaly.  After `UserRebaseConfirmable` eventually returns the worker attempts to continue making DB queries, but PG returns `terminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout` and the job fails.\n\nIn `strace` we see:\n\n```\n27585 20:21:39.180018 sendto(102\u003cUNIX:[127187-\u003e127188]\u003e, \"Q\\0\\0\\0\\nBEGIN\\0\", 11, MSG_NOSIGNAL, NULL, 0) = 11 \u003c0.000103\u003e\n27585 20:21:39.180209 recvfrom(102\u003cUNIX:[127187-\u003e127188]\u003e, \"C\\0\\0\\0\\nBEGIN\\0Z\\0\\0\\0\\5T\", 16384, 0, NULL, NULL) = 17 \u003c0.000020\u003e\n# REBASE RUNS HERE AND RETURNS SHA\n27585 20:23:09.407970 sendto(102\u003cUNIX:[127187-\u003e127188]\u003e, \"P\\0\\0\\1q\\0SELECT  \\\"merge_requests\\\".* FROM \\\"merge_requests\\\" WHERE \\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"target_project_id\\\" = 2 AND \\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"source_branch\\\" = 'short-rebase' AND \\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"target_branch\\\" = 'master' AND \\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"source_project_id\\\" = 2 AND (\\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"state\\\" IN ('opened')) AND \\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"id\\\" != 8 ORDER BY \\\"merge_requests\\\".\\\"id\\\" ASC LIMIT 1\\0\\0\\0B\\0\\0\\0\\16\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\1\\0\\0D\\0\\0\\0\\6P\\0E\\0\\0\\0\\t\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0S\\0\\0\\0\\4\", 407, MSG_NOSIGNAL, NULL, 0) = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe) \u003c0.000050\u003e\n27585 20:23:09.408160 recvfrom(102\u003cUNIX:[127187-\u003e127188]\u003e, \"E\\0\\0\\0zSFATAL\\0VFATAL\\0C25P03\\0Mterminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout\\0Fpostgres.c\\0L3036\\0RProcessInterrupts\\0\\0\", 16384, 0, NULL, NULL) = 123 \u003c0.000025\u003e\n```\n\n\n/cc @oswaldo","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-12T04:44:58.521Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T19:03:49.029Z","closed_at":"2019-12-23T01:13:54.640Z","closed_by":{"id":1187333,"username":"jramsay-gitlab","name":"James Ramsay (ex-GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1187333/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jramsay-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","backend","customer","devops::create","group::code review","merge requests","planning priority","priority::1","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":11493,"username":"oswaldo","name":"Oswaldo Ferreira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/oswaldo"}],"author":{"id":2578846,"username":"wchandler","name":"Will Chandler","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8b92738249753faee7055e021f8221?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wchandler"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11493,"username":"oswaldo","name":"Oswaldo Ferreira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/oswaldo"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-11-29","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33943","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33943","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33943/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33943/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33943","relative":"#33943","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33943"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25860901,"iid":33915,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove DAST report legacy ZAProxy fields","description":"# Context\nThe DAST tool is migrating from a custom ZAProxy format to use the Common Report Format.

In a private group and being signed in as a member, update the title or description of an issue (same for MRs and Epics) and include a mention to the group.\n2. Mark To-Dos as done.\n3.

of:\n\n```ruby\ndescribe 'number of queries' do\n  subject { environment_folder.find_for_projects(projects) }\n\n  context 'with one environment' do\n    let(:projects) { [create(:project)] }\n\n

analytics endpoint doesn't enforce properly tier check","description":"**[HackerOne report #707375](https://hackerone.com/reports/707375)** by `rpadovani` on 2019-10-03, assigned to @cmaxim:\n\n### Summary\n\nThe new [Productivity Analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/productivity_analytics.html) feature should be available only to Premium or higher accounts.\n\nThe endpoint to retrieve data for the feature, however, doesn't properly authenticate the user, allowing any user to retrieve the data, making the feature easily available to anyone.\n\nHowever, there isn't any leak of confidential data, because the users retrieve only data that they could already retrieve, if they had paid.\n\nIt is just an unauthorized access to paid resources.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. The endpoint `/-/analytics/productivity_analytics`, when queried for a JSON reply using the `Accept` header, returns data in the JSON format. If you do not specify anything, it returns the HTML page.  \n2. The endpoint authenticates the parameter `group_id` and `project_id`. That is, it checks the group or the project has at least a premium license.  \n3. If you do not specify nor the `group_id` or the `project_id`, the endpoint just executes the query.  \n4. In this way, you can access all the data needed to do the analytics. You can also access public data of other projects that are not usually easily accessible.  \n5. Since a lot of parameters are accepted, it is easy to customize the search to return only the MR of a project that is not under the premium license. E.g: using the `my_reaction_emoji` parameter.\n\nHere the list of accepted parameters:\n\n-     scope: 'created_by_me' or 'assigned_to_me' or 'all'  \n-     state: 'open', 'closed', 'merged', 'locked', or 'all'  \n-     milestone_title: string  \n-     author_id: integer  \n-     assignee_id: integer  \n-     search: string  \n-     in: 'title', 'description', or a string joining them with comma  \n-     label_name: string  \n-     sort: string  \n-     non_archived: boolean  \n-     my_reaction_emoji: string  \n-     source_branch: string  \n-     target_branch: string  \n-     created_after: datetime  \n-     created_before: datetime  \n-     updated_after: datetime  \n-     updated_before: datetime\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers can access a premium feature for free without any difficulty (a proxy or a browser plugin would work well enough)\n\n### Examples\n\nThis is an example of a fetch request made from the console, so with the cookies:\n\n```  \n a = await fetch(\"https://gitlab.com/-/analytics/productivity_analytics?scope=created_by_me\", {  \n    \"credentials\": \"include\",  \n    \"headers\": {  \n        \"Accept\": \"application/json, text/plain, */*\",  \n        \"X-CSRF-Token\": \"token\",  \n        \"X-Requested-With\": \"XMLHttpRequest\"  \n    },  \n    \"referrer\": \"https://gitlab.com/-/analytics/productivity_analytics\",  \n    \"method\": \"GET\",  \n    \"mode\": \"cors\"  \n});  \nawait a.json()  \n```\n\nThe response is an array of 20 objects with all the data needed by the feature\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nI can query the productivity_analytics endpoint without specifying group_id nor project_id\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n group_id or project_id are required, and they are used to check I am allowed to access the resource\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can access a premium feature for free without any difficulty (a proxy or a browser plugin would work well enough)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-11T10:59:06.779Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T00:07:24.404Z","closed_at":"2019-10-17T17:58:18.440Z","closed_by":{"id":444,"username":"dzaporozhets","name":"Dmytro Zaporozhets (DZ)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/444/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzaporozhets"},"labels":["HackerOne","devops::manage","group::optimize","priority::3","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":731039,"iid":38,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/10/22/gitlab-12-4-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:41:53.212Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:43.889Z","due_date":"2019-10-17","start_date":"2019-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-01-07","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33876","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33876","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33876/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33876/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33876","relative":"#33876","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33876"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25845421,"iid":33870,"project_id":278964,"title":"Match and display policies to licenses that are already detected in a project","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nProblem: there is no clear way to tell if licenses detected in the project are in compliance with the policies defined.\n\nContext: this issue is based on discovery work done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12941 and is a follow up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/14061.

Now , as a non member, just visit to project details pages `https://gitlab.com/\u003cUserName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e` and do the inspect element of browser. \n\n4. In `Body` html tag, you should see `data-find-file` attribute which exposes default branch. Note that default branch can be set to anything by admins.\n\n![Screenshot_2019-10-02_at_17.17.31.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/bb91a676-4fd4-4e09-9ff2-d2bc2e98d1c2/Screenshot_2019-10-02_at_17.17.31.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Examples\n\nYou can see my project here at `https://gitlab.com/gitlabadminuser/thisispublicproject` and follow the above steps to know default branch from this project.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDefault branch is visible to non members when they do not have any access to repository\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNone of the repository related information should be visible to non members when they do not have access\n\n\n### Output of checks  \nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too.\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nThis bug exposes default branch to\n\n1. Non members in public project when repository is `only project members`  \n2. Guest in private project can see when they do not have any access to repository  \n3. No badges setup in projects/groups  \n4. Public pipelines are disabled\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_2019-10-02_at_17.17.31.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/bb91a676-4fd4-4e09-9ff2-d2bc2e98d1c2/Screenshot_2019-10-02_at_17.17.31.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-11T08:17:01.665Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T08:54:31.370Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T11:49:11.750Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","SaaS","Weakness::CWE-200","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","priority::4","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::4","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33864","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33864","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33864/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33864/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33864","relative":"#33864","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33864"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7128,"epic":{"id":384256,"iid":7128,"title":"Security Engineering Allocation (Source Code BE): 10-NOV-2021","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7128","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25838148,"iid":33861,"project_id":278964,"title":"Non Member of Public Project Can Publish Drafted Reviews on Locked Merge Request","description":"**[HackerOne report #706044](https://hackerone.com/reports/706044)** by `rafiem` on 2019-10-02, assigned to @cmaxim:\n\nHi Team,\n\nI have found improper access control on comment changes in merge request section. In the change section of merge request, user can make review, add comment and reply to comment to spesific line of code that changed. In case of submitting a review, user firstly create a draft of review, and then can finish review and submit review or add comment now. In the issue i found, when non members of public project previously created a pending draft review in one of the merge request, user still able to publish and submit the drafted review even if the merge request is locked by the members of the project. This violate the rule of locked merge request, that only project members can comment on all part of the spesific merge request.\n\n### Proof of Concept  \n1.) User A have a public project , example : https://gitlab.com/bajigur/cuk1  \n2.) User B and then make a draft review on one of the merge request in https://gitlab.com/bajigur/cuk1  \n3.) User A then set the merge request that User B make a draft review to Locked  \n4.) User B still able to submit and publish the drafted review that he previously make, that allow User B to comment to part of merge request, which is forbidden when merge request is locked\n\n\u003c\u003ePoC Video Attached  \n![PoC.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/65f20dae-9de5-4866-b419-5cde70dbf399/PoC.webm)\n\n## Impact\n\nNon members still able to comment to merge reqeuest through darft review in changes even if merge request is locked\n\nBest Regards,  \n@rafiem\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [PoC.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/65f20dae-9de5-4866-b419-5cde70dbf399/PoC.webm)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-11T07:26:05.745Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T22:42:41.899Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T03:00:07.564Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-12-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33861","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33861","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33861/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33861/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33861","relative":"#33861","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33861"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25836132,"iid":33856,"project_id":278964,"title":"Operations Settings h4 =\u003e h3","description":"Change Headings on Operations Settings pages from h4 to h3.

Although questions about the file-by-file navigation remain, adjusting the navigation tabs was well received.\n\n## Proposal\n\nTo provide more predictable and easy to find navigation within a merge request, and to provide greater focus in each area of the merge request:\n\n- move the merge request navigation tabs above the description\n- only show the description and merge widget on the **Overview** tab (replacing the discussions tab)\n\nSince early research was very positive, we are confident that this deserves maximum exposure:\n- Add a feature flag, off by default, without a need for the user preference. We can then progressively enable the feature on GitLab.com.\n- Add an explanatory popover (see image below) with a button to dismiss (saved as a cookie?) and a link to an feedback issue.\n- To collect feedback, we can publish a blog post that links to the feedback issue and share it internally and on social media.\n\n| Top of MR | Between MR widget and activity feed |\n|---|---|\n| Notice the removal of redundant horizontal lines/borders and reduced vertical padding/margins. | The activity filter dropdown is aligned with the emoji reactions, just like in issues today. |\n| ![image](/uploads/7802ca2b9dacb71c2d0d3a35eb9ba56e/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/052569531e1b5e3863bb3ac1511763b9/image.png) |\n| `You can now find the navigation tabs of all merge requests at the top, where they’re easy to access. [More information and share feedback] [Got it!]` | |\n\n## Permissions and Security\n\nNone. This change is cosmetic only, rearranging information that is already visible.\n\n## Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nThe hero screenshot on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/ will need to be updated.\n\n## Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose?

We aren't taking advantage of the DAG structure in any way to render an important view. We need to determine the problem that people need to solve when they are visualizing a DAG.\n\nSome initial discussions have taken place in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31877.\n\n- Opportunity canvas: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17a3Jjzt0s69GRsN-JPeCf0rlmz9URyEZ2E9qOIpCbDY/edit\n- Discussion guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TYbi--6JyB3JtWnEdbQE3ExR_xJo_fpWLxGwX7vyGwg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDAG pipelines are currently rendered as follows:\n\n![image](/uploads/adde4ca741bd5091104d9bea7c9fd09e/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/5a07f3229c8211719885b14707230267/image.png)\n\nThe internal representation of the data structure is something more like the following:\n\n![image](/uploads/f6e1922d2eee838149a69d909fc997cd/image.png)\n\nAs part of discovering the problem here we should also investigate how people are using the pipeline view. There are interesting possibilities for an integrated view rather than having two modes, since a stage flow can be considered a more rigid subset of a DAG. For example, there culd be one pipeline style that supports both DAG and non-DAG pipelines, especially since GitLab's DAGs can be hybrids. We could ignore stages from the platform's perspective, and essentially make them a kind of annotation for a job. In this way we'd have a unified concept.\n\n## Reach\n\nThis impacts users who have advanced, complex pipelines and are some of the largest most sophisticated users of GitLab pipelines.\n\n3.0 = Significant reach (~25% to ~50%).\n\n## Impact\n\nWe have provided these teams with a solution that works in terms of execution, but have not given them any tools in order to visualize and understand what's actually happening. The only possibility is to look at the `.gitlab-ci.yml` to understand what's going on.\n\n2.0 = High impact\n\n## Confidence\n\nWe are very confident that this is a problem. We knew when implementing the DAG that we were doing it without any UX. This was the right decision and still a valuable capability, but we knew we needed to come back and solve this problem.\n\n100% = High confidence\n\n## Effort\n\nThis is a moderate effort requiring new frontend work to display what's actually happening in the UX, and possibly backend changes to deliver the information to the frontend. It's also a challenging problem to solve and will require some thought and careful consideration to come up with a good solution.\n\n- PM .5\n- Designer .5\n- Frontend Engineer 1\n- Backend Engineer .5\n\nTotal 2.5 (though this is highly speculative as no specific solution has been identified)\n\n### UX Weighting rubric\n\n| Size     | Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|----------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| Trivial  | 1     | Mostly small to medium UI changes, smaller UX improvements, without unanswered questions.

This is disturbing.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI think it would be better to have a single section [`Authenticating with an OAuth token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#authenticating-with-an-oauth-token) and directly show the user that environment variables can be used.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-10T12:34:39.880Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T18:30:24.843Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T18:20:25.497Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","devops::package","documentation","group::package registry","npm Registry"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick Kipling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nkipling"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick Kipling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nkipling"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33788","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33788","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33788/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33788/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33788","relative":"#33788","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33788"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25805910,"iid":33785,"project_id":278964,"title":"Check that uploaded file content matches the file extension","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIn the past, we have had several problems when the uploaded file content doesn't match the file extension, ie different `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` headers.\n\nWe should check the integrity of the file before storing the file and reject the upload.\n\n### Proposal\n\nA quick fix (I haven't tested edge cases or whether there is a better approach) would be:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/uploaders/gitlab_uploader.rb b/app/uploaders/gitlab_uploader.rb\nindex 7dc211b14e4..aaf4e6ec7cf 100644\n--- a/app/uploaders/gitlab_uploader.rb\n+++ b/app/uploaders/gitlab_uploader.rb\n@@ -3,6 +3,8 @@\n class GitlabUploader \u003c CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n   class_attribute :options\n \n+  before :cache, :check_content_type_integrity!\n+\n   class \u003c\u003c self\n     # DSL setter\n     def storage_options(options)\n@@ -136,4 +138,10 @@ class GitlabUploader \u003c CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n   def pathname\n     @pathname ||= Pathname.new(path)\n   end\n+\n+  def check_content_type_integrity!(file)\n+    if MimeMagic.by_magic(file.read) != MimeMagic.by_path(filename).type\n+      raise CarrierWave::IntegrityError, 'Content type does not match file extension'\n+    end\n+  end\n end\n```\n\nNevertheless, we should change the FE part to handle exceptions coming from the uploader.

This leads to me batching testing to save time but it can hold up things from deploying and people get mad at me. This sucks but is necessary for me to feel the feature won't break when real users get it.\n\n**Personal:** Parker (Product Manager)\n\n* I do not trust that an increase in code coverage means a less buggy product and I do not have data to prove that as code coverage changes customer found defects change in lock step.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

By showing a graph of the change in code coverage on master in a project over time users can visualize how the overall quality is changing and start to provide context to compare to other measures like customer found defects, performance and business KPIs.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n* Add a code coverage graph over time in the Analytics -\u003e [Repository page])(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/graphs/master/charts). Use the value from the job(s) that include a code coverage regex.\n* If there is more than one job include those job names in the dropdown so users can see coverage for each calculation.\n  * (For example the gitlab project has a job to calculate ruby coverage and another to calculate javascript coverage).\n* For the MVC graph code coverage as defined by the user and using the name defined by the user.\n* The graph will be a fixed 3 month window.\n* For purposes of the MVC if a job name is changed historic data maybe lost (stretch to map from one to the other but not part of the acceptance criteria).\n\n**Outcomes**\n\n**Persona:** Delaney\n\n* When I am asked about how the code coverage of a project has changed in this release, I want to have a visual representation to share, so that I can be trusted as an individual who runs a team that cares about quality.\n* When I am asked about our velocity/tech debt, I want to have a visual representation to compare to bugs fixed/features shipped, so that I can be trusted as a leader running a highly performant team.\n\n**Persona:** Parker\n* When I am weighing bug fixes against features, I want a data point of code coverage over time of software my team works on, so that I can back up my choices about balancing features vs. fixes.\n\n**Persona:** QA Manager\n* When I am planning tests for a project, I want a data point of code coverage over time for the project, so I can feel confident that my test plan will find issues before customers do.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Update code coverage to instruct how to make the graph(s) appear if need be\n* Document how the names used in code coverage definition will appear on the graph to set expectations with customers.\n* Update code coverage documentation to reflect where the graph appears and what data will appear when (eg; it will update daily for yesterday's last code coverage value for /master).\n* Note that if a job name is changed historic tracking will be lost per [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33743#note_281322470) in the issue.\n* Document that data points are available and shown only on days the job to calculate the coverage is completed.\n\n### Testing\n\n* Check load time on page to ensure this is performant / doesn't slow the page load time down.\n* Check data quality / graph look.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\nWe want both Delaney and our QA engineer to be confident that the trajectory of the code coverage is positive with changes being made while balancing the desire of a product manager to deliver value to users through new features. This graph should deliver confidence to all 3 parties by giving Delaney a measure for engineers to write tests with new code, QA to have confidence that as changes are introduced basic unit tests are also being added and the PM to know that new features will be available / work as intended for users.\n\n* Page views of graph page. We believe this feature will result in an increase of page views on the Repository Analytics page by 10% on instances that can utilize the feature.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* Graph is displayed for projects with code coverage stats.\n\t* Show last data point for the day and scale of days?\n* Data displayed is accurate as compared to raw data\n* Cross browser testing / things look acceptable to design (Making it look nice on mobile is a stretch for the MVC)\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nThe buyer for this feature is likely [Delaney](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead) but we see this iteration as basic functionality that belongs in our Core offering. As more features are developed on top of this MVC they may be part of a different tier.\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

This token allows anyone in possession to forge authentic requests to trigger a CI pipeline within GitLab although the person might not be a project member anymore.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTested on GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.3.0-pre 32dae28364b\n\nBefore, create a **Github** account, create a project there, and push a valid `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.\n\n1. Create a new project. Chose `CI/CD for external repo` to import a project  \n2. Chose `Github` under `Connect repositories from`  \n3. Enter your personal access token from your GitHub account where you want to import the project from  \n4. Select the project you created before Github for sync  \n5. After importing the project, goto `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/edit` and export the project  \n6. Download the project archive, extract it, and inspect the containing `project.json`\n\n```json  \n...  \n    \"jobs_cache_index\": null,  \n    \"external_authorization_classification_label\": \"\",  \n    \"external_webhook_token\": \"hcnPbsfximlueXxaaIkg\",  \n    \"pages_https_only\": true,  \n    \"merge_requests_author_approval\": null,  \n...  \n```\n\nNote, this is a fake token for the report.\n\nWhen looking in the code one observes the request `POST :id/mirror/pull` in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/lib/api/project_mirror.rb#L59. This request is used to trigger a new pipeline for a Github connected repository. This request uses the `X-Hub-Signature` header to authenticate the request to create the pipeline. This signature is computed by computing an HMAC over the request data using `external_webhook_token` as the key.\n\nBy being in possession of `external_webhook_token` it means that you craft a request and forge a valid `X-Hub-Signature` to create a new pipeline. So anyone, who can download the project can later on, when for example he is not a project member anymore, craft such a request and thereby trigger a pipeline.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe external `external_webhook_token` is exported. This allows anyone in possession of this token to forge a valid POST request to trigger a new CI pipeline. In the worst case, an attacker can possibly create thousands of CI pipelines and thus DoS the CI infrastructure.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe project export contains `external_webhook_token`.

Anyway, it is not useful because this secret is bound to one specific webhook at Github, which still points to the original GitLab project.

We should aim to support offline execution and provide clear documentation on how to configure it for such installations.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nFrom [comment in parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1359#note_174177030):\n\nLooking at source code, LicenseFinder is usually able to extract the license from the local package, like in [bundler.rb](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.8.0/lib/license_finder/package_managers/bundler.rb). This is not the case for Python though, and LicenseFinder performs a GET request to get package metadata from pypi.org, see [pip.rb](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.8.0/lib/license_finder/package_managers/pip.rb#L61).\n\nWe need to go through all the supported languages and define whether or not they support air-gapped, how to do it and if not what can we do to make it work (in our wrapper project or in the upstream project).\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI created this project to test out each of the package managers so that I can go in depth where needed. \n\n[Discovery project](https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha/lm-airgap-spike#license-scanning-airgap).\n\nI have identified the following issues that needs further investigation:\n\n* [ ] Rebar: rebar3 is not supported.\n* [ ] Gradle: Requires that the project have a plugin installed. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/202126 \n* [ ] Maven: Uses a plugin to download missing license info at scan time.\n* [ ] sbt: Depends on a plugin to be installed in project settings.\n\nThe following project types are currently not airgap friendly.\n\n* [ ] Cargo: requires [--offline](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-metadata.html) flag.\n* [ ] Gradle: plugin appears to download license info at scan time.\n* [ ] Maven: plugin appears to download license info at scan time.\n* [ ] Nuget: The current core requires that the dependencies are installed under the project root otherwise it looks airgap friendly. We need to add a `-PackagesDirectory /code/packages` to [here](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/de82cff7a99985bd95b54442479e345d83fea3a0/lib/license_finder/package_managers/nuget.rb#L81).\n* [ ] Pip: Depends on `pypi.org` API at scan time.

We currently rely on either manual testing or analyzers' included `test/fixtures` to ensure there are no regressions. This is time consuming and not very efficient.\n\nWe recently introduced new jobs to [CI templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/) in order to trigger test project's pipelines. We done configuring those for in Dependency Scanning analyzers. We should do the same for SAST analysers. You can see how it is done in Dependency Scanning [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/#how-to-tests-the-analyzers) or you can simply check [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/)\n\n### Tasks\n\n- For each of the analyzers below with existing test projects, add CI job for master/tags to trigger downstream QA projects. Please keep current integration tests in place as that will give us test coverage on MR branches.\n- Update [release process docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common#versioning-and-release-process) to explicitly state that master must be passing before creating a tag to release a new version.\n\n### Current State\n\nAs of May 22, 2020, the MRs that have been created add downstream pipelines that use DinD (via the SAST orchestrator). But, the intent of this issue is to use non-DinD and avoid the SAST orchestrator.\n\nWhile the downstream DinD pipelines add coverage, this issue should not be considered closed until we have non-DinD coverage given that non-Dind is [now the default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37278).\n\n### No DinD implementation plan\n\n* Engineers add their name in the column(s) for projects in which they want to call dibs.\n* If a `no_dind-FREEZE` does not exist, create it via MR.\n* Create an MR against the test project's `no_dind-FREEZE` branch to add SAST to the CI, configured without DinD.\n* Add MR establishing a no-DinD configuration to the matrix.\n\n### Related issue\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/10658\n\n\n---\n\n## Analyzer to test project matrix\n\n\n| Scan

For many of you, this meant using a capital letter. However, npmjs.com does not allow capital letters in the scope. So, you were forced to either change your group name, which may have several unintended side effects or to not use the GitLab Package Registry.\n\nMoving forward, we will no longer enforce this naming convention for the project-level endpoint. Huzzah. Now you can name your packages and scope whatever you want. Hopefully, this makes using GitLab and npmjs.com a little bit easier to use. \n\nIt's worth noting that using the [instance-level endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#instance-level-npm-endpoint-1) will still require you to use the exact (case sensitive) root of your namespace as `@scope`.  \n\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nOur current `npm` API enforces a [naming convention](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#package-naming-convention). This naming convention has some problems as it is too restrictive to some users or ~\"self-managed\" instances.\n\nThe implementation has been done before my time but I think that the naming convention is mainly used to locate the proper package when hitting the instance level API. Basically, the ~backend  receives: hey, I need package `X` and that's it, no group id, no project id. With the only information of the package name, the ~backend has to accurately locate the package within all projects accessible for the current user.\n\nThis naming convention is implemented as a [model validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/packages/package.rb#L37), which means that before a npm package is saved to the database, the package name has to be conform to the naming convention, which means that *all* npm packages need to be ok with that convention.\n\n### Proposal \n\nUse the same approach as we have in the [Maven API](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#configuring-your-project-to-use-the-gitlab-maven-repository-url):\n\n* At the Project level\n   * Don't impose any naming restriction. Users are free to use whatever they want, including not using an `@scope` at all.\n* At the Instance level\n   * Similar to [maven](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#instance-level-maven-endpoint), *only* the packages that follow the naming convention are exposed via this API level.\n   * If a package doesn't follow the naming convention, it can't be retrieved with the instance level API.\n\n### Other considerations\n\nIf one day, we ever implement the Group level API, I think we can follow again what we have for the [Maven api](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#configuring-your-project-to-use-the-gitlab-maven-repository-url):\n* At the Group level\n   * Don't impose any naming convention\n   * What about duplicated package names? Use the same strategy as on the Maven API:\n\n\u003e The group level endpoint works with any package names, which means the you have the flexibility of naming compared to instance level endpoint. However, GitLab will not guarantee the uniqueness of the package names within the group. You can have two projects with the same package name and package version. As a result, GitLab will serve whichever one is more recent. \n\n### Work complexity\n\nIt should be quite low as we \"only\" have:\n* remove the model validator\n* make sure that the instance level API locate the package using the naming convention (should be already the case, so nothing to do).\n* make sure that the project level API works with any package name (rspec example)\n* make sure that the instance level API works with *only* package names that follow the naming convention (rspec example)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-09T07:28:31.127Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T07:07:44.242Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T08:19:36.105Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","UX","customer","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","npm Registry","package:active","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":4646508,"username":"u118739","name":"Christof Leuenberger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4646508/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/u118739"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":79,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":31,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33685","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33685","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33685/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33685/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33685","relative":"#33685","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33685"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3608,"epic":{"id":68992,"iid":3608,"title":"Virtual npm registry","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3608","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":25742450,"iid":33669,"project_id":278964,"title":"Error linking existing user account to new smart card","description":"### Summary\nIf smart card authentication is enabled and the \"Sign-up enabled\" box is unchecked, and a smart card is presented with the same email as an existing user, an error will be presented.

However, many users do not know that after they remove an image via the Container Registry UI that they are NOT deleted from storage. \r\n\r\nThis is problematic for self-managed customers that are surprised by storage costs for the Container Registry. \r\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\r\n\r\n### Intended users\r\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\r\n\r\n### Further details\r\n\r\n#### Self-managed vs gitlab.com\r\nSince GitLab.com users can not run garbage collection, this feature should be for self-managed users only.

(self-managed instances only) deletes an image(s) from the Container Registry UI, alert them that the image is ready for deletion and that they should run garbage collection to remove it from storage.

change.\r\n\r\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\r\n- Success looks like self-managed instance owners are aware that in order to delete an image from storage, it must be

It appears that creating a new user from the admin page will also cause this to occur. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\t\n1) Create a new AWS EC2 instance. T2.Medium / Amazon Linux. Ports 22,80,443,3444 open.\n2) Set hostname and Install GitLab Omnibus using yum (https with let's encrypt)\n3) Bring up gitlab and set root password. \n4) Open admin page and validate that \"Sign-up enabled\" is checked.\n5) Logout\n6) On the login page, select the \"Register\" tab and attempt to create a new user. It will be successful\n7) Install premium license\n8) Edit /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb to add\n\tgitlab_rails['smartcard_enabled'] = true\n\tgitlab_rails['smartcard_ca_file'] = \"/etc/gitlab/ssl/TanukiCA.pem\"\n\tgitlab_rails['smartcard_client_certificate_required_port'] = 3444\n\t\t\n9) Upload CA key to /etc/gitlab/ssl/\n10) gitlab-ctl reconfigure\n11) Go to login page\n12) Select register tab and attempt to create a new user.  When you click the \"Register\" button a 500 error will be presented. \n\nNote: Logging in as root and manually creating a user from the admin page appears to trigger the same issue.\n\n### Example Project\nBecause this bug involves smart card authentication, it can not be recreated on GitLab.com.

Let me know if you would like access. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen attempting to register a new user, a 500 error occurs.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe \"register\" tab on the login page should probably be disabled if smart card auth is enabled.

In the future, we will add even more resources. \n\nWhat if we just create a single scheduler for all king of resources? It would look like `Geo::RepositoryVerification::Primary::ShardWorker` but the responsibility should be broader. I propose to create a separate scheduler for Primary and Secondary. The actual worker that calculates the checksum can only receive two arguments: resource_type and id. All existing resources can be identified by this identification system, including uploads, designs, container repositories, and even wikis and repositories. Of course, the ordering system should take into account priorities and should prevent the system from clogging when one important resource takes all the capacity. \n\nI created this issue after brainstorming https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/32467, I noticed that adding new resource is incredibly hard now.\n\nPS Sorry, It seems like I saw a similar issue somewhere but I could not find it.\n\n**UPDATE:**\nRequirements:\n* ensuring a primary checksum\n* running everything automatically at scale\n* producing metrics\n* reverifying\n* configurable rate limiting\n* optimizing checksumming of remotely stored files\n\ncc @geo-team","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-08T11:52:18.292Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T22:07:10.041Z","closed_at":"2019-10-17T11:08:54.317Z","closed_by":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"labels":["devops::systems","direction","group::geo","product discovery [DEPRECATED]","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33624","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33624","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33624/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/33624/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#33624","relative":"#33624","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#33624"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2097,"epic":{"id":14196,"iid":2097,"title":"Verification Framework","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2097","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25721574,"iid":33623,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove the broadcast messages endpoints from our internal api","description":"Those messages are now part of the `post_receive` endpoint.\n\nDone so in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/13916\n\n\n____\nThe following discussion from !18089 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @reprazent started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18089#note_226955226):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e I think these endpoints can also be removed in a follow up issue.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-08T11:35:20.390Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T12:28:17.229Z","closed_at":"2019-10-10T12:28:17.187Z","closed_by":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"labels":["api","devops::create","group::source code","maintenance::refactor","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

By looking at the timestamps for the job's steps:\n\n1. The `prepare-executor` section started at `Time.at(1570529032) =\u003e 2019-10-08 12:03:52 +0200`\n1.

GitLab metadata to verify and troubleshoot packages","description":"### Problem to solve\nThe GitLab Package Registry allows users to build, publish and share images using the command line or GitLab CI/CD. GitLab also provides a user interface, where users can view, download and delete packages *(maven, npm, conan)* at the project and group level. However, the user interface does not include any information about who created a given package and how it was published.  \n\nThis is a problem because users need that metadata in order to identify that a package was built correctly and to confirm they are using the correct version of the package. \n\n#### User stories\n- I as a developer, when I am navigating to the Package Registry, need to confirm that my package was built correctly and that I am using the correct version, so that I can ship high quality code. (This user story comes from our most recent [user survey](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/uxr_insights/issues/623))\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\nInclude build details, such as `pipeline_id`, `branch`, `commit` and `commit_sha` for any package being hosted in the GitLab Package Registry that has been built utilizing GitLab CI/CD. \n\n- `pipeline_id` should link to the pipeline details page to help users troubleshoot when something has gone wrong. \n- `branch` and `commit` should link to their respective repositories to help the user find/verify the code that built a specific package. \n- `commit_sha` should be easily copyably to ensure the user can leverage this information elsewhere. \n\n### Further details\n\n#### User survey results\n- Based on a [recent survey](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/uxr_insights/issues/611), users ranked the metadata that is most important to them:\n\n#### User interface\n![Screenshot_2020-01-08_at_10.53.40](/uploads/9b16544962262159750c6227b68f04e7/Screenshot_2020-01-08_at_10.53.40.png)\n![pipeline](/uploads/95f012ef0d84240c6107e18f2888844e/pipeline.gif)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this issue.\n\n### Documentation\n- There are no documentation changes required for this issue.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like users are able to confirm that their package was built correctly and that they are using the correct version.\n- We can measure this by measuring engagement with the Package Registry UI\n  - Page views\n  - Links clicked in the UI\n\n### What is the type of buyer?

In order to achieve that goal, we must provide support for the most commonly used package managers for our users. This [ever-growing list](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1245) requires that we are able to add support for new formats in a timely manner. \n\nAs a team, we have decided that in order to de-risk this work that we need time for engineers to investigate the documentation, APIs and overall feasibility of adding support for a new format.\n\n.NET developers need a mechanism to create, share, and consume packages that contain compiled code and other content in projects that consume these packages. For .NET, the Microsoft-supported mechanism for sharing code is NuGet, which defines how packages for .NET are created, hosted, and consumed, and provides the tools for each of those roles.\n\nThis issue is to investigate and familiarize ourselves with the NuGet and .NET documentation so that we can streamline the development process in the subsequent milestone. \n\n### Proposal\nReview the [NuGet MVC proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/20050) and corresponding [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview)/[.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/) documentation to better understand the requirements and functionality. Go through the process of installing and using NuGet to gain a technical understanding of the effort involved so we have a clear path forward for development.\n\nThis work should be time-boxed into no more than a few days. If after a few days the package manager still has a high degree of unknowns, it should be noted and re-evaluated rather than consuming more time. The engineer doing this investigation should share their technical notes and findings in this issue so the engineer(s) that work on the implementation don't have to go through the same process of discovering new information.\n\n### Further details\n- One option that we are considering as an MVC is to only show the feed for users at the project level, so they can better understand which packages are being used, but not necessarily have their own NuGet registry hosted on GitLab. \n\n#### NuGet Commands (MVC)\n\n##### Configuration and Authentication\n- [`nuget config`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-config): Gets or sets NuGet configuration values. The user will configure NuGet based on GitLab documentation\n- [`nuget setapikey`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-setapikey): Saves an API key for a given package source when that package source requires a key for access. The user will use their GitLab personal access token for authentication.\n\n##### Create, publish and consume\n- [`nuget pack`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-pack): Creates a NuGet package from a .nuspec or project file. When running on Mono, creating a package from a project file is not supported.\n- [`nuget push`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-push): Publishes a package to a package source.\n- [`nuget list`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-list): Displays packages from a given source.\n- [`nuget delete`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-delete): Removes or unlists a package from a package source.\n\n##### NuGet Commands (Beyond the MVC)\n- [`nuget spec`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-spec): Generates a .nuspec file, using tokens if generating the file from a Visual Studio project.\n- [`nuget update`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-update): Updates a project's packages to the latest available versions. Not supported when running on Mono.\n- [`nuget restore`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-restore): Restores all packages referenced by the package management format in use. When running on Mono, restoring packages using the PackageReference format is not supported.\n\n##### Competitor Examples\n- [JFrog's NuGet Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/NuGet+Repositories)\n- [Sonatype's NuGet Integration](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/formats/nuget-repositories)\n\n### Links / references\n- [Microsoft NuGet Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget)\n- [NuGet v3 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview)\n- [https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json](https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json)\n- [Mono (for running nuget.exe on mac/linux)](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/)\nries)\n\n# Investigation Findings:\n\n* Vocabulary: \"Feed\" seems to be used in different way but seems to always be what we call the package registry in GitLab. The `nuget` CLI use the term \"Source\"\n* Different clients but all will call `nuget` for main functions. Also the `nuget` configuration file is used across the different clients. Example: I added my local dummy Source to `nuget` and then I opened Visual Studio. My local Source was properly listed as a NuGet Feed.\n* Packages are searched across all Sources/Feeds or the pull command can be scoped to a specific Source/Feed.\n* The [NuGet Server API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview#resources-and-schema) defines 4+1 services as required: (services as in \"nuget services\". Nuget services can handle 1 or many urls)\n  * The Service Index\n  * The Search Service\n  * The Push/Delete Service\n  * The Package Metadata Service\n  * The Package Content Service\n* A total of 9 requests have to be handled. One seems to be optional.\n  * This translates to 9 Grape API endpoints to implement.\n\n## Authentication\n\n* The main authentication mechanism is a http basic auth but the Source/Feed has to be under https.\n* Should be compatible with GitLab username + token.\n* For the Push Service an additional authentication mechanism is available: an API token. This token is sent along the push request as a custom http header: `X-NuGet-ApiKey`. This could be used for the CI_JOB_TOKEN (see below).\n\n## Variables used in this comment\n\nFor a given package `MyCompany.MyPackage.1.0.0Beta.nupkg`, here are what the API docs uses:\n\n* `api_base_url`: The base url. For this API, it should be something like `/api/v4/projects/40/packages/nuget`\n* `XX_service_url`: The service url for service XXX as returned by the Service Index.\n* `ID`: `MyCompany.MyPackage`\n* `Version`: `1.0.0Beta`\n* `LOWER_ID`: `mycompany.mypackage`\n* `LOWER_VERSION`: `1.0.0beta`\n\n## The Service Index\n\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/service-index\n* Used as entry point when a private Source/Feed is added.\n* Aggressively cached by clients\n\n### GET {api_base_url}/index.json\n\n* Simple json describing which services are available and what are their urls.\n\n## The Search Service\n\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/search-query-service-resource\n* Used by Visual Studio. (search not available in `nuget`)\n\n### GET {search_service_url}?q={QUERY}\u0026skip={SKIP}\u0026take={TAKE}\u0026prerelease={PRERELEASE}\u0026semVerLevel={SEMVERLEVEL}\n\n* Parameters\n  * `q` the search term. Server implementation is free to apply this filter on any field. Example: the search term can be applied to the name **or** the name and the description of a package, etc.\n  * `skip` pagination parameter. This is the offset. Default to 0\n  * `take` pagination parameter. This is the number of entries per page. Server implementation can impose a max value\n  * `prerelease` to include prerelease packages or not\n  * `semVerLevel` to include SemVer 2.0.0 packages\n\n## The Push/Delete Service\n\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/package-publish-resource\n* Can be authenticated through a custom http header.\n\n### PUT {push_service_url}\n\n* The NuGet (compressed) archive is sent without any additional parameters.\n* :warning: This means that this request has no metadata available. In short, we get a compressed archive and that's it.\n* :warning: The backend will need to extract and inspect this compressed archive. Since this can take some time to do, this extraction should be done in a background job.\n\nLog excerpt:\n\n```\n$ nuget push Bananas.1.0.0.nupkg -Source \"local\"\nWARNING: No API Key was provided and no API Key could be found for 'http://localhost:4000/api/v4/projects/40/packages/nuget'. To save an API Key for a source use the 'setApiKey' command.\nPushing Bananas.1.0.0.nupkg to 'http://localhost:4000/api/v4/projects/40/packages/nuget'...\n  PUT http://localhost:4000/api/v4/projects/40/packages/nuget/\n  Created http://localhost:4000/api/v4/projects/40/packages/nuget/ 38ms\nYour package was pushed.\n```\n\n### DELETE {push_service_url}/{ID}/{VERSION}\n\n* Interpretation left to the server implementation\n  * NuGet.org and github unlists the package but archives are still available for pulling.\n  * Can be a hard delete. :warning: This can easily break project builds.\n\n### POST {push_service_url}/{ID}/{VERSION}\n\n* Relist a previously unlisted package\n* No body request\n\n## The Package Metadata Service\n\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource\n* The most complex endpoint\n* Not only metadata is listed but also :warning: **dependencies**\n\n### GET {metadata_service_url}/{LOWER_ID}/index.json\n\n* bulk listing of all metadata for all available versions\n* the json for the metadata is quite complex (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/registration-base-url-resource#sample-response-1)\n* can be broken into pages. (I didn't find an example for this :/)\n* Uses the `LOWER_ID` and `LOWER_VERSION`\n\n### GET {metadata_service_url}/{LOWER_ID}/{VERSION}.json\n\n* similar response as above but for a given version\n* undocumented but implemented by github\n* not sure that this url is used by `nuget` or Visual Studio (I didn't see this request fired)\n\n## The Package Content Service\n\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/package-base-address-resource\n* Service to get the archive but also some metadata (see below)\n* Uses the `LOWER_ID` and `LOWER_VERSION`\n\n### GET {content_service_url}/{LOWER_ID}/index.json\n\n* Simple json to with a single array: all available versions.\n\n### GET {content_service_url}/{LOWER_ID}/{LOWER_VERSION}/{LOWER_ID}.{LOWER_VERSION}.nupkg\n\n* The archive of the given package\n* Yes LOWER_ID and LOWER_VERSION are duplicated in the url :thinking:\n\n### GET {content_service_url}/{LOWER_ID}/{LOWER_VERSION}/{LOWER_ID}.nuspec\n\n* The `nuspec` file of the archive\n* Not called during my tests but documented\n* Not implemented by github (404 Not Found)\n\n# Proposed MVC Scope\n\n* Being able to add a project NuGet registry url to `nuget` in an authenticated manner using GitLab username + token.\n* Being able to push a NuGet package (`nuget push`)\n* Being able to pull a NuGet package (`nuget install`)\n* Being able to delete a NuGet package (`nuget delete`)\n* Ideally no changes on the FE side for the first version\n\nThe 5 endpoints should be enough to implement the MVC Scope for the `nuget`, `dotnet` and Visual Studio clients.\n\n# Naming convention\n\nSince the MVC scope is for the project level, I don't think we don't need a naming convention. For future versions (if we implement the instance level access for example), we can enforce the use of `.` as a separator to identify a Group: `MyGroup.MyPackage`.\n\n# Pain points\n\n* The metadata of a package will need to be available in the database as it is heavily used by the Package Metadata Service.\n* The upload is a simple archive upload. No parameters about the metadata.\n* It looks like we will need to open the archive and extract the metadata to have it available within the GitLab database. This should be done in a background job.\n* Good news: the dependency models implemented in !14263 can be reused.\n* The Search Service uses a custom pagination parameters set. Those will need to be translated into what we use in the code.\n\n# Opportunities\n\n* We could implement this as an internal API as suggested in #35798\n* The Metadata extraction job could be implemented in a generic way to be easily ported to other package types.\n\n# Proposed MRs breakdown\n\n1. API Skeleton + The Service Index + authentication + feature flag (weight 1)\n1. Workhorse updates to handle the upload url (weight 1)\n1. The Push/Delete Service (weight 2)\n1.

Update `searchQuery` from “test”(300+ matches) to “update”(8,500+ matches) in ~~k6/tests/api_v4_projects_project_search_blobs.js~~ `k6/tests/api/api_v4_projects_project_search_blobs.js`\n1. Run the specific test with the `run-k6` command.  For example against the 10k environment you would run this following from the project root: `ACCESS_TOKEN=\"\" ./run-k6 -e environments/10k.json -s scenarios/60s_200rps.json -t tests/api/api_v4_projects_project_search_blobs.js`, where `ACCESS_TOKEN` is a valid GitLab Personal Access Token for the specified environment(10k in this case). The token should come from a User that has admin access for the project(s) to be tested and have API and read_repository permissions.\n1. If you're seeking to run the test against your own environment the [Toolkit's documentation has details on how to achieve this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/blob/master/docs/k6.md).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API will slow depending on the number of matches in the project code.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe API responds quickly since the API only returns 20 results via pagination.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-07T12:38:38.888Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:54:25.203Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T22:27:07.086Z","closed_by":{"id":4888751,"username":"changzhengliu","name":"Changzheng

Notes\n\nWhen you have setup your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to retry failed jobs and they exceed that number it can be hard to gather data about why those jobs are failing from the API.\n\nNow you can see the `failure_reason` of a job in the Jobs API to more easily gather data about jobs that are failing.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently you can specify in `.gitlab-ci.yml` when a job needs to be [retried](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#retry) based on the condition of why the job failed, by specifying values for `when`.\n\nWhen you look at a failed [job via the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/jobs.html), it doesn't state why it failed, e.g. `script_failure`.\n\nThank you `@albert.vacacintora` for this contribution!\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the response from an API call to retrieve details from a failed job, it would be beneficial if the response includes the reason for failure, such as:\n\n\n* unknown_failure\n* script_failure\n* api_failure\n* stuck_or_timeout_failure\n* runner_system_failure\n* missing_dependency_failure\n* runner_unsupported\n\n### Links /
