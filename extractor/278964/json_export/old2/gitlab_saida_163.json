As a polling service, we're going to create a small script and run it every 20 minutes with a pipeline schedule.\n\n## API format\n\n| Endpoint | params | description |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| `GET api/v4/projects/:id/merge_trains` | `scope`, `sort` | Get all merge trains of a project |\n\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://gitlab.com/dosuken123/merge-trains-health-checker\n\n## Past metrics\n\nWe can also run a [manual script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35166#note_237624466) to collect such data point. e.g. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WN0eFOrVatLvI47ry3t1czom2UnUO2iNKe-rACiNEbI/edit#gid=1349733017","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-12T16:09:05.774Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T12:27:41.388Z","closed_at":"2020-02-27T03:53:06.117Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","auto updated","cicd::active","devops::release","group::release","missed:12.8","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36146","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36146","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36146/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36146/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36146","relative":"#36146","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36146"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1881,"epic":{"id":12033,"iid":1881,"title":"Re-Enabling Merge Trains for www-gitlab-com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1881","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26984424,"iid":36140,"project_id":278964,"title":"Set 'assumeImmutableResults' to false by default","description":"Right now, until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35898 is not resolved, the `freezeResults` config has no actual effect.

MR widget\n\n    ![image](/uploads/8e7a111b85a0ab62d39cea5e0a81941d/image.png)\n\n1. MR's pipelines tab\n\n    ![image](/uploads/03bccc48678def007473fdd4e8d40743/image.png)\n\n1.

For example, displaying an icon to indicate the presence of a downstream/child pipeline is present in MR widget, but nowhere else. This makes it a pain to reach downstream pipelines from other places, especially when you haven't created an MR.\n\n#### Proposal\n\nAdd the [`\u003clinked-pipelines-mini-list /\u003e`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/linked_pipelines_mini_list.vue#L0-1) component to the other instances of the mini pipeline graph to match the behaviour in the MR widget.\n\n1. Make the change in the `PipelinesTableComponent`. The data should be there. This covers 2, 3, and table not called out.✐ It's a `3`.\n1. Make changes to `app/assets/javascripts/projects/commit_box/info/init_commit_pipeline_mini_graph.js`, create a wrapper and an Apollo instance, and add the iid and project path to `app/views/projects/commit/_commit_box.html.haml`.

(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/5135)\n\nTo keep changes to a minimum, I think we can start by preparing our backend storage to support multiple milestones while keeping everything else working the same way.\n\nThe idea is to create separate tables `issue_milestones`, `merge_request_milestones`, and `epic_milestones` and then reading / writing to that instead of `milestone_id`. Old data would have to be migrated too.\n\nWe would still support just 1 milestone for now and then we would need something like:\n\n```ruby\ndef milestone\n  milestones.first\nend\n\ndef milestone=(milestone)\n  self.milestones = [milestone]\nend\n```\n\nThough in reality it's not that simple and a lot of things may break. Here are some things mentioned previously that need to be considered:\n\n1. API\n1. Webhooks\n1. Quick actions\n1. Filters\n1. Epic milestone date calculation\n1. Any code that has `where(milestone_id: ...)` would break and would need to a `JOIN` now.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-11T09:59:41.030Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T07:06:00.551Z","closed_at":"2020-01-14T20:11:12.671Z","closed_by":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","database","devops::plan","group::project management","missed-deliverable","missed:12.6","planning priority","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":590748,"username":"mdelaossa","name":"Mario de la Ossa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/590748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mdelaossa"}],"author":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":590748,"username":"mdelaossa","name":"Mario de la Ossa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/590748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mdelaossa"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36032","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36032","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36032/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36032/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36032","relative":"#36032","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36032"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26914870,"iid":36026,"project_id":278964,"title":"GitLab incorrectly deletes tags when external registry storage deletion is disabled","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen deleting tags from an external registry that has [storage delete disabled](https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#delete), the tag is removed from GitLab even though it is not removed from the underlying registry.\n\nAfter refreshing, GitLab reports that \"This image has no active tags\" and you can see a red \"Something went wrong while fetching the registry list\" notification banner appear on the top of the page. See screenshot:\n\n![Screenshot_2019-11-11_at_4.12.42_PM](/uploads/1a0142afc9a839e4f4b0802003d481b3/Screenshot_2019-11-11_at_4.12.42_PM.png)\n\nThis apparently results in the container registry tags being left in a funky state. The customer's workaround was to enable registry storage deletion and manually trigger tag deletion via API to get the tags to be completely deleted.\n\nThis was [reported](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/137428) (Zendesk, internal use only) by a 500-seat ultimate customer.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Configure an external registry with GitLab\n1. Set the external registry to have storage delete disabled\n1. Delete a tag from the container registry UI\n\n### Example Project\n\nN/A\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe tag is removed from GitLab.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe tag should not be removed from GitLab.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nLogs from

We would store this URL parameter field and associated value in a hidden field in the trial signup flow (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13233) which would allow us to track trial volume and associated close rates. \n \n| Location | Image | Trial Source Value |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Top right drop down | ![screenshot-2019-11-07-19-36-40](/uploads/ea84d1ccd01aef18563448c8ee84909d/screenshot-2019-11-07-19-36-40.png) | top-right-dropdown | \n| Security paywall | ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.36.15_PM](/uploads/e8f716f7257a3e1fc4a83c2a8f44aa72/Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.36.15_PM.png) | security-paywall | \n| Group billing (CTA located between group name and tiers) /groups/group111111/-/billings | ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.38.50_PM](/uploads/2c457b737ebb91672579c2a7a5600801/Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.38.50_PM.png) |  Group-billing | \n| User billing /profile/billings | ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.41.50_PM](/uploads/5066c262368479a61b780a2942cdaa83/Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.41.50_PM.png) |  user-billing | \n| about https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/ | ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.46.04_PM](/uploads/ca020b1f7076df95250251f8553ca1fa/Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_2.46.04_PM.png) | about-free-trial |","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-07T19:57:31.745Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T15:05:45.159Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T16:29:13.513Z","closed_by":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::growth","group::acquisition","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"}],"author":{"id":4413992,"username":"s_awezec","name":"Sam Awezec","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4413992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/s_awezec"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/119083","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/119083","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/119083/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/119083/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#119083","relative":"#119083","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#119083"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26822165,"iid":35861,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rework Import/Export versioning mechanism: define the forward and backward compatibility","description":"In our current implementation of Import/Export, we could not make the Import from the previous version of the Export.  \nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/version_checker.rb#L30\n  \nFrom the discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/17949, it seems that we try to avoid/delay updating the version of import/export as much as possible because we don't want to break compatibility.  \n  \nTo continue reworking import/export, we will need to bump the version and still support (import) older exports.  \nThe current implementation will block us.  \n  \nThere is a detailed proposal from Kamil how it could be changed: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/17949#note_229383502\n  \nExample 1:  \nRelations rename. We should be comfortable supporting both old and new relation schemes for a number of recent versions. We should avoid duplicating both relations in the export (currently, it hits performance/memory).   \n  \nExample 2:  \nHaving new relations added to Export/Import, it should still be possible to import older versions of the exports.\n  \nFor these cases, having a separate version of the importer and the exporter could give us more flexibility.  \nFor example, `Importer v2.3` may not support exports made with `Exporter v3.0`, but is aware of exports made with `Exporter v2.1` and `Exporter v2.2` and supports them. At the same time, compatibility with exports created by `Exporter v.1.N` could be deprecated.  \n  \nConcerns:  \n- To migrate to the new mechanism, we will need to have some transitional version of the logic, which is compatible with the current implementation. \n- (please comment on the issue)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-07T17:44:58.311Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T21:01:09.336Z","closed_at":"2020-04-29T20:26:45.140Z","closed_by":{"id":926632,"username":"joshlambert","name":"Joshua Lambert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0bdc5209b11e9c0953f80234dcb4ffb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/joshlambert"},"labels":["Background Processing","Category:Importers","DEPRECATED_Import/Export Refactor","DEPRECATED_project export","DEPRECATED_project import","Importer:Project Export/Import","Mechanical Sympathy","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","bug::performance","devops::systems","gitlab.com","group::import"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nSome customers automation scripts are broken because in some cases \"git push\" using deploy keys is not working any more. This happened, for examples, for deploy keys that were created by users, whose accounts are blocked now or keys having null user_id in the database.\n\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n#### Use case\n\n\nI created 4 ssh keys, added them as global from admin interface. In the database table \"keys\" they had \"user_id\" set to my user's id. I left first as is, for others set \"user_id\" field to: NULL, id of blocked user, id of another user accordingly.\nWhen I ssh to the gitlab instance with this keys I get greetings like this:\n* key1: Welcome to GitLab, @[my_user]\n* key2: Welcome to GitLab, Anonymous!\n* key3: Welcome to GitLab, @[blocked_user]\n* key4: Welcome to GitLab, @[other_user]\n\nI find it strange also, that deploy key is linked in such a way with its creator, but this is offtopic here.\n \nThen I prepared a private project: created an empty project, enabled those depoy keys in it, set write permission, cloned, made initial commit, pushed. After that tested pull/push operations with different deploy keys.\n\nClone or pull works with all those keys.\n\nPush operation works only with the first key, for other keys I receive such errors:\n* key2 (null user)\n```\nEnumerating objects: 5, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 256 bytes | 256.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: GitLab: This action cannot be performed by internal users\nTo ssh://gitlab/user/test-keys.git\n !

Do not know what type of access other user needs in this case, have not tested all the cases.\n\n#### Proposed workaround that works for some users:\n\n\u003e When I noticed that file don't add keys, I delete file /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/authorized_keys and stared command sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure.\n\u003e \n\u003e This file create. Via web-interface I delete all keys, and add their again.\n\u003e \n\u003e It worked!\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAs per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35779#note_250710439 there is a workaround offered which basically queries for expired users and replaces the user with a valid user while maintaining the deploy key - so that in fact no project configuration needs to change since the deploy key stays the same. Under the admin area-\u003edeploy keys currently allows you to create instance-wide SSH deploy keys. Can we add a list there of the anomalies - meaning display a table only for blocked and expired users\n\n| Project name | Project ID | User status | User ID | Deploy Key |\n|----|--|--|--|---|\n\n\nThe admin can edit the user ID from this console and this will make the change in the DB without needed to run anything.\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/8f920d8791f6ab786a48e745e977c167/image.png)\n\nAlso we would need to capture this in an audit log\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nThere are  scenarios, where the blocked user still has/owns the private SSH key which pairs with the public SSH key imported into the project. Would not that raise a security concern?\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29749485/dont-work-ssh-in-gitlab/29765704#29765704\n\n/label ~feature\n\n### Old issue for safe keeping\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n### Summary\n\nAfter updating from version 12.3.x to 12.4.1, I'm getting complaints from colleagues that they have their automation scripts broken because in some cases \"git push\" using deploy keys is not working any more. This happened, for examples, for deploy keys that were created by users, whose accounts are blocked now or keys having null user_id in the database.\n\nI have also find similar issue here: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/unable-to-push-to-repo-after-updating-gitlab/31088\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI created 4 ssh keys, added them as global from admin interface. In the database table \"keys\" they had \"user_id\" set to my user's id. I left first as is, for others set \"user_id\" field to: NULL, id of blocked user, id of another user accordingly.\nWhen I ssh to the gitlab instance with this keys I get greetings like this:\n* key1: Welcome to GitLab, @[my_user]\n* key2: Welcome to GitLab, Anonymous!\n* key3: Welcome to GitLab, @[blocked_user]\n* key4: Welcome to GitLab, @[other_user]\n\nI find it strange also, that deploy key is linked in such a way with its creator, but this is offtopic here.\n \nThen I prepared a private project: created an empty project, enabled those depoy keys in it, set write permission, cloned, made inital commit, pushed. After that tested pull/push operations with different deploy keys.\n\nClone or pull works with all those keys.\n\nPush operation works only with the first key, for other keys I receive such errors:\n* key2 (null user)\n```\nEnumerating objects: 5, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 256 bytes | 256.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: GitLab: This action cannot be performed by internal users\nTo ssh://gitlab/user/test-keys.git\n !

Do not know what type of access other user needs in this case, have not tested all the cases.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDeploy keys that were working on the 12.3.x version, are no longer working and I see no reason why user, that created them should affect its behaviour. Because now \"anonymous\" keys are not working, as keys, created by some categories of users. And I see no work case how to make a deploy key, that will work independently of the status of some account.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIt should be possible to use deploy key with write access, that was added by blocked or some unrelated user. A working script should continue working if the deploy key is still enabled in the repo, no matter that some user was blocked. Because currently somebody have to add the key for the script to work, but later it can stop working on the project and that should not break it.\n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate a way that will replace an existing deploy key with a new one in the UI with the correct permissions (will in fact replace the entry in the DB), that will in turn change the keys for the existing projects\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-06T22:10:59.126Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:32:28.638Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T23:37:03.585Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan

Care should be taken to not duplicate the entire merge requests listing API, instead we should  reuse as much as possible (ideally even the supported input parameters).\n\nThe API should be supported by both the REST and Graphql APIs, though I would argue that the REST API is most important since that is probably what most (or at least we) will be using.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-06T14:07:03.046Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T10:33:20.235Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T15:39:40.007Z","closed_by":{"id":2737706,"username":"darbyfrey","name":"Darby Frey","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2737706/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/darbyfrey"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","api","cicd::planning","deploy","devops::release","direction","group::release","team::Delivery","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"}],"author":{"id":209240,"username":"yorickpeterse","name":"Yorick Peterse","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/209240/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35739","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35739","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35739/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35739/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#35739","relative":"#35739","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#35739"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1936,"epic":{"id":12499,"iid":1936,"title":"Use GitLab environments \u0026 deployments for deploying to GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1936","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26764373,"iid":35738,"project_id":278964,"title":"Evaluate performance and usage of epic issues count graphql endpoint","description":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19450 introduced graphql API endpoint for getting number of sub-epics and issues.
