Any attempt to access the `secondary` redirects to the `primary`. The only known way to reach the `secondary` is to login as an *administrative* user on the `primary`, navigate to the Geo admin panel and click the \"Open Projects\" button for the `secondary`.\r\n\r\nThe GitLab instance uses Okta for authentication and this may be related.\r\n\r\nThis bug prevents a customer from using Geo for anything but disaster recovery, as no unprivileged user can access the `secondary` node.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Log into the `primary` node and open a session in your browser.\r\n2. Open another browser tab and type in the address to the `secondary`\r\n3. The browser tab which was used to access the `secondary` is automatically redirected to the `primary`. This can be observed by inspecting the URL. As a regular user it is not possible to access the `secondary` due to this redirect loop.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to access the `secondary` if a user has admin privileges. In this case, a user can navigate to the Admin Area -\u003e Geo -\u003e Open projects (for the `secondary`) button and move from there to the `secondary`. No redirect is triggered.

The MVC feature is only enabled for public projects because the caching proxy does not yet support authentication. In order to make it available to all projects, we need to add authentication in order to avoid a potential DDoS where someone is making unauthorized requests against a private proxy.\n\n### Intended users\n\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sasha)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-devon)\n- [Systems Administrator](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney)\n\n### Proposal\nAdd authentication for private projects, based on appropriate credentials for that project.\n\n1. When user executes `docker pull` command it will make a request to GitLab Dependency proxy URL.\n1. When the request hits `DependencyProxyForContainersController` for private group we return 401. With `WWW-Authenticate` header realm pointing toward some `auth` route.\n1. This will make docker client send a request to provided `auth` route with username and password (or PAT).\n1. We check user/password combination and return OAuth2 token if OK.\n1. This will make docker client send a repeating request to `DependencyProxyForContainersController` but now with OAuth2 token added to header. We use OAuth2 token for to set `current_user` variable and check for access to private group. Then we proceed with the request like we do for a public group.\n\n### Further details\n![v2-registry-auth](/uploads/c0f18e215ce86292a03f59a443375f85/v2-registry-auth.png)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- The proxy will require authentication to avoid utilization of bandwidth or storage resources by an unauthorized user in a denial-of-service scenario, in particular for gitlab.com where everything is publicly routable. This could be achieved through asking the proxy to fetch remote resources until the storage is full. \n- The feature belongs at the group level, but complicates authentication because a group can contain a mix of public and private projects, with different permissions. One straightforward option here is to allow usage of a project token from any project that is a member of the group to authenticate.\n\n\n### Documentation\nWe will update the [Dependency Proxy Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/dependency_proxy/) to include details about authentication.\n\n### Testing\n- Test authentication for private projects, groups and sub-groups\n- Test private projects that haven't authenticated\n- Automate the [feature test to use of dependency proxy with a private project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/222)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nSuccess looks like we have made the dependency proxy available for private and public projects. \n\nWe do not currently have the ability to track this data, however https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/61583 will help us to start tracking and measuring this data so we can make better predictions about usage and adoption.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \nFor now, the dependency proxy is focused on premium and ultimate customers. \n\nIn order to expand to additional buyer types we need to improve performance and support Unicorn. This issue details those efforts: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11548 \n\n### Links / references\n- [Docker Registry Authentication Documentation](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/c192a281f8ac6f2a351fe729c8a56108f8edb377/docs/spec/auth/token.md#how-to-authenticate)\n- [GitLab Container Registry Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/container_registry.html)\n- [Dependency Proxy Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/dependency_proxy/)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-13T09:33:42.399Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T07:42:39.042Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T17:29:01.015Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Proxy","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","customer","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","maturity::viable","package:active","quad-planning::complete-action","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":444,"username":"dzaporozhets","name":"Dmytro Zaporozhets (DZ)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/444/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzaporozhets"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":79,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":19,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11582","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11582","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11582/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11582/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11582","relative":"#11582","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11582"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2920,"epic":{"id":33177,"iid":2920,"title":"Make the Dependency Proxy 'Complete'","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2920","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 21, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e11\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24695775,"iid":28673,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update outdated Jira configuration instructions in doc/integration/jira_development_panel.md","description":"\u003c!--\n\n* Use this issue template for suggesting new docs or updates to existing docs.\n  Note: Doc work as part of feature development is covered in the Feature Request template.\n  \n* For issues related to features of the docs.gitlab.com site, see\n     https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-docs/issues/       \n\n* For information about documentation content and process, see\n     https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/ --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Type of issue --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Un-comment the line for the applicable doc issue type to add its label.\n     Note that all text on that line is deleted upon issue creation. --\u003e\n\u003c!-- /label gitlab-ce~9444929 - New doc needed to cover a new topic or use case. --\u003e\n\u003c!-- /label gitlab-ce~9444930 - Improving an existing doc;

This means that customers cannot build systems around their own customised git push options.\n\nFor example, the following two push options:\n\n`git push -u origin -o 'foo' -o 'bar'`\n\nShould become exposed in the Push and Tag Event Webhooks payloads as:\n\n```\n\"push_options\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nThis feature was previously added in 11.7 as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/15643, but was unintentionally removed in 11.10 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/26752. \n\nThe regression was raised and discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/26752#note_164043657.\n\n**What caused the regression?**\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/26752 introduced a class `Gitlab::PushOptions` to parse push options passed to the `post_receive` API endpoint to make it easier for GitLab to extract their namespaced push option values. At the same time, the `Gitlab::PushOptions` class also filters out unrecognised push options. In the `post_receive` API endpoint the `PostReceive` worker class receives the push options, which eventually are passed to classes that execute the push webhooks. Any unrecognised push options will have been removed.\n\n**What should be fixed?**\n\nThe git push option data exposed in the Push and Tag Event Webhooks needs to be the unparsed data.\n\nThe parsed data from `Gitlab::PushOptions` is a Hash.

solve\n\nThe Dependency Proxy allows users to reduce risk and reliance on external dependencies by caching frequently used packages for fast, reliable access. However, since the Rails app downloads the blobs from upstream sources, it's possible that while downloading is in progress, it will block other requests. In other words, heavy use of the dependency proxy can cause [Unicorn](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/unicorn.html) to be busy and delayed in serving other user requests. \n\nTo mitigate that risk we decided to enable the dependency proxy, only for users that are using the [Puma web server](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/puma.html). \n\nThe problem is that Puma support is experimental at this time and not recommended for production yet. In order to drive adoption, increase our user base and allow our users to take advantage of the dependency proxy, we need to remove the reliance on Unicorn for downloading dependencies so that we can ensure fast response times of the GitLab application. \n\n### Intended users\n\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sasha)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-devon)\n- [Systems Administrator](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney)\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe will move the download logic to workhorse and off of unicorn/puma web servers. This will ensure that we don't waste unicorn workers while downloading blobs from upstream.\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Background\n\nSee [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/merge_requests/379#note_156137660) for background and how we decided to only enable the feature for the Puma web server. to enable feature only for Puma web server.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n- There are no changes to permissions required for this change. \n- There is a separate issue to add authentication for the dependency proxy: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11582\n\n### Documentation\n- We will update the documentation for enabling and configuring the dependency proxy to remove the note about Puma and add any necessary clarifying details.\n\n### Testing\n- Test downloading of blobs works as expected\n- Performance testing at scale\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSuccess looks like we agree as a team that we can roll out the dependency proxy to gitlab.com. Once live, we can track adoption of the dependency proxy by the following metrics over time:\n- `# of groups with the feature on/off`\n- `median # of items in the proxy per` \n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nThe goal of this project will be to bring this feature to all types of buyers. Currently the feature is limited to Premium and Ultimate customers, but rolling it out to GitLab will allow us to bring value to all customer tiers. \n\n### Links / references\n- [Dependency Proxy Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/dependency_proxy/)\n- [Container Registry Admin Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/container_registry)\n- [Container Registry User Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/container_registry.html)\n- [Original workhorse conversation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/merge_requests/379)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-09T07:55:40.391Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T12:16:57.604Z","closed_at":"2021-07-20T20:43:42.102Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Proxy","GitLab Core","Package:P1","backend","customer","devops::package","golang","group::package registry","kubernetes-migration-blocker","maintenance::refactor","maturity::viable","section::ops","wg_k8s-migration","workhorse"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":3913904,"username":"dcroft","name":"Daniel Croft","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2af6159fa5cd9659356041c6a9b9ce62?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dcroft"}],"author":{"id":444,"username":"dzaporozhets","name":"Dmytro Zaporozhets (DZ)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/444/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzaporozhets"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3913904,"username":"dcroft","name":"Daniel Croft","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2af6159fa5cd9659356041c6a9b9ce62?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dcroft"},"user_notes_count":52,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11548","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11548","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11548/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11548/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11548","relative":"#11548","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11548"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24695604,"iid":28608,"project_id":278964,"title":"CI Uploading artifacts output error 500","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label.\n\nFor the Community Edition issue tracker:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nFor the Enterprise Edition issue tracker:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n```\nUploading artifacts...\nmain: found 1 matching files                       \nWARNING: Uploading artifacts to coordinator... failed  id=60 responseStatus=500 Internal Server Error status=500 Internal Server Error token=epPn7Ash\nWARNING: Retrying...                                error=invalid argument\nWARNING: Uploading artifacts to coordinator... failed  id=60 responseStatus=500 Internal Server Error status=500 Internal Server Error token=epPn7Ash\nWARNING: Retrying...                                error=invalid argument\nWARNING: Uploading artifacts to coordinator... failed  id=60 responseStatus=500 Internal Server Error status=500 Internal Server Error token=epPn7Ash\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\n[Repo imported here](https://gitlab.com/misaka00251/Virus-Detect-Using-String).

link)\n\nClicking on suggested approvers when creating and editing a merger request does nothing.\n\nReproduced on 11.10.2-ee and GitLab.com running 11.11.0-rc1-ee.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a new project as `user1` and author some files, e.g. a README.\n- Add another user, `user2`, as a member of the project with at least Developer access.\n- Set required approvals to `1`\n- Create a new merge request as `user2` updating the README.\n- *Suggested approvers:* shows approvers based on the previous authors of the files affected by the merge request. In my test case, this was `user1`.\n- Click on `user2` and observe nothing happens.\n\n### Example Project\n\n#### Reproduced on GitLab.com\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/dummy-projects/ticket-120395/merge_requests/1\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n- Clicking on the suggested approver(s) does nothing.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n- Clicking on the suggested approver should add the approver.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n- I observed no errors in the logs on my local test instance.\n- No errors in Chrome DevTools\n- Once the merge request is submitted, click on edit and click on any suggested approver and nothing happens\n - Hover on a user and the URL goes to `http://collen-gitlab-test/my-group/some-project/merge_requests/5/edit#` on my test instance and to `https://gitlab.com/dummy-projects/ticket-120395/merge_requests/1/edit#` on the GitLab.com project above.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-07T15:50:09.459Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T15:15:28.430Z","closed_at":"2021-03-02T13:21:46.178Z","closed_by":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Category:Source Code Management","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","approvals","customer","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","needs investigation","priority::2","regression","regression:11.10","reviewers","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This branch name is sent via e-mail which is rendered as HTML.\n\n**Description:**  \nOne way to exploit this is by forking a repository. Then an attacker would create a branch called `\u003cscript\u003ealert(1)\u003c/script\u003e` and make a simple change. Now the attacker creates a merge request to the original repository and assign a reviewer to it. The reviewer will receive the e-mail with the branch name not sanitised. \n\nAnother way to exploit is to by adding Gitlab users to a repository the attacker controls and assign them to review merge requests.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nNote: These instructions work on GDK with the latest version. I wasn't sure if it is allowed to test something like on gitlab.com\n\n  1.  Choose a public repository and fork it (let's say HTML5 boilerplate)  \n  2. Go through the repository main page http://yourserver:3000/root/html5-boilerplate  \n  3. Click on the button + button and select New File  \n  4. Create any file but choose a different target branch (something like `\u003cscript\u003ealert(1)\u003c/script\u003e`\n  5. Gitlab will direct you to a page to create a new merge request from your recently create branch to master. Ignore that.  \n  6. Open a New Merge Request  \n  7. Select Source Branch as your fork and the recently created branch  \n  8. As for Target branch select the original repo and master  \n  9. Click submit  \n10. Select one the maintainers of the original repo   \n11. Submit  \n12. Go to letter opener (/rails/letter_opener/)  \n13. See the alert popping up.\n\nThe steps above only require UI, but an attacker can create a branch name through git client as well. The create branch option UI protects against this attack.\n\nThere is also another version of the attack, where a repository owner can add any Gitlab users to become members of her repo. The attacker now create a Merge Request in his own repo and assign the new member to it. Same result. \n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n* Vulnerable code at `gitlab-ce/app/views/notify/new_merge_request_email.html.haml` line 6. This is the exploit above.  \n* Vulnerable code at `gitlab-ce/app/views/notify/repository_push_email.text.haml` line 49. I haven't created an exploit for this one, but I would assume it should be similar.\n\n## Impact\n\nE-mail clients nowadays are well protected against XSS. However, a malicious user could use Gitlab's name to mislead users. The problem with this vulnerability is the reach. It is my understanding, an attacker can add whoever is a Gitlab user as a member of her own repo. So she could send malicious e-mails to them.

This MR proved that even the Geo developer that added GeoNode name (me) can forget that it needs a trailing slash if the setting wasn't set (and was left to default to external_url).\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Geo setup docs should instruct you to set `gitlab_rails['geo_node_name']`. We shouldn't expose people to the confusing backwards-compatibility rule: \"add a trailing slash if you're letting it default to external_url\".\n\n- [ ] Modify [Add the secondary node](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/configuration.html#step-3-add-the-secondary-node) section.

And check out https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/master/doc/howto/geo.md#add-secondary-node for some ideas.\n\nThe primary node record is created by a command, which is reliable. But setting `geo_node_name` on the primary would avoid confusion when sysadmins are modifying nodes or failing over. So let's also:\n\n- [ ] Modify [Configure the primary server](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/database.html#step-1-configure-the-primary-server) section. E.g.:\n  1.

For example, currently, 20 analyzers that are using `common`. If we bump up the version of `common`, we should have a process that is able to create 20 MRs(one for each analyzer) automatically.\n* Predefined title, description, labels of all generated MRs.\n\nAll the work related to changelog is addressed in this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215546).\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Work in \u003chttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/analyzer.yml\u003e\n\n- [ ] Add job that can be triggered to update to a specific version of common in the test container and run tests\n- [ ] Add job that can be triggered to create an MR if the analyzer isn't using the latest version of common\n\n### Work in \u003chttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml\u003e\n\n- [ ] Add CI stage to run tests on all analyzers with the current version of common.

couple of issues here in EPIC notes api  \n`https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/notes.html#list-all-epic-notes`\n\n**Issue1**\n\nThe API `GET /groups/:id/epics/:epic_id/notes` has an IDOR issue. ie. It lists the notes of EPIC without checking the groups.\n\nFor eg, `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/\u003cREDACTED public_group_id/epics/\u003cREDACTED epic_id\u003e/notes`\n\nAbove will list notes from `REDACTED epic_id` EPIC where as `REDACTED public_group_id` is a group that doesnt belong to this EPIC. So if you just sequentially run the IDs of epic, it will work. \n\nNote that `REDACTED epic_id` is the internal ID of EPIC \n\nHowever, this only discloses notes from PUBLIC groups only but this need fixing\n\n**Issue2**\n\nThis is more of a security issue because it leaks information which ideally not visible publicly.\n\nFor eg, if a EPIC is promoted from issue which belongs to private project, it may contain private information like milestone, labels applied to the issue before promoting to an epic. This API response disclose everything!\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/\u003cAnyPublicGroupID\u003e/epics/\u003cEPIC_IID\u003e/notes`\n\n2. Just keep changing `\u003cEPIC_IID\u003e` in above requests and you will see notes belongs to other groups.\n\n3. Also see the responses, This discloses more information of epic historical activities from timeline if it was promoted from issues\n\n\n\n### Examples POC\n\n1. Go to `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cREDACTED private group\u003e/-/epics/\u003cREDACTED epic ID\u003e`   \n2. You will see few activities there and not much information . But there is a information there which you can not see because this epic was promoted from private project.  \n3. Now go to `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/\u003cREDACTED public_group_id\u003e/epics/\u003cREDACTED epic_id\u003e/notes`  \n4. In response, you will see more information which you cant see in UI. The information includes milestone, labels from private project that was applied before it was promoted to EPIC from issue!\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nIDOR+Info disclosure in EPIC note api\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nEPIC note api should only work for EPIC that belong to that group and should not disclose historical information if it was promoted from private project issue\n\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nEPIC note api works for any group (works for public groups only)\n\nEPIC notes API response discloses historical information when it was promoted from private project issue\n\n-------------------------\n\nRelated Security Issue: https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/issues/2875","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-02T00:26:49.548Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:09:01.743Z","closed_at":"2019-08-29T22:53:10.333Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":3078895,"username":"pd-gitlab","name":"Patrick Derichs","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e106768fae83577b0eec7daf082cb7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pd-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3078895,"username":"pd-gitlab","name":"Patrick Derichs","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e106768fae83577b0eec7daf082cb7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pd-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-07-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11431","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11431","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11431/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11431/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11431","relative":"#11431","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11431"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24695202,"iid":28440,"project_id":278964,"title":"Import pending members from public projects or private projects (if you have guest role)","description":"**[HackerOne report #542539](https://hackerone.com/reports/542539)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-04-19, assigned to `asaba`:\n\n### Summary\n\nHello,\n\nAs per documentation here `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#import-users-from-another-project` ,\n\n`In the dropdown menu, you can see only the projects you are Maintainer on`.\n\nThis is NOT true. You can also see the projects where you have just `Guest` access to. \n\nThe problem with this is, once you import members from such projects, a guest can see all pending members who are invited using emails but havent joined the project yet! i.e guests will be able to see all the email ids of the members who are invited using email by Admins but not yet joined gitlab.\n\nIf they just visit the url directly in UI, they dont see these members who have not joined gitlab yet!\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \n1. As a Owner in your project, navigate to `https://gitlab.com/\u003cYourUserName\u003e/\u003cYourProject\u003e/project_members/import`\n\n2. When you click on the dropdown, you will not only see the projects where you are maintainer on, but you will see all the projects where you just have `Guest` role too.\n\n3.

You can also replace the `source_project_id` parameter in above request with public projects too, and it will import from public projects too!\n\n\n5. This will import the email ids of member who have not joined the selected project which you dont see when you navigate to member url from UI!\n\n\n\n\n### Examples POC\n\nNavigate to my public project here `https://gitlab.com/gitlabadminrsspl1111/thisispublicproject/project_members`\n\nYou will just see one member there.\n\nNow follow the above reproduction steps, and replace the `source_project_id` parameter in above request to `10776018` and send the request\n\nNow check the member list. You will see an email there . This is an invited email which guest users cant see normally as the invited member has not yet joined the gitlab/project!\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAllows you to import pending members from public projects as well as private projects where you just have guest role\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnly members from project which you have maintainers role should be allowed to import\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too\n\n## Impact\n\nAllows you to import pending members from public projects as well as private projects where you just have guest role.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe `Import` feature should only allow users to import members from projects where the user has a `Maintainer` role.

Without doing anything else, just click on save and capture the below request\n\n```  \nPOST /PrivateGroupofGuest/project2/merge_requests/2 HTTP/1.1  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Length: 542  \nCache-Control: max-age=0  \nOrigin: https://gitlab.com  \nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36  \nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3  \nReferer: https://gitlab.com/PrivateGroupofGuest/project2/merge_requests/2/edit  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nAccept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8  \nCookie: _gitlab_session=1; event_filter=all; sidebar_collapsed=false\n\nutf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026_method=patch\u0026authenticity_token=1\u0026merge_request%5Btitle%5D=ExampleMergeRequest\u0026merge_request%5Bdescription%5D=Closes+%233\u0026merge_request%5Bassignee_id%5D=\u0026merge_request%5Bmilestone_id%5D=847953\u0026merge_request%5Blabel_ids%5D%5B%5D=\u0026merge_request%5Blabel_ids%5D%5B%5D=10328587\u0026merge_request%5Btarget_branch%5D=master\u0026merge_request%5Bforce_remove_source_branch%5D=0\u0026merge_request%5Bsquash%5D=0\u0026merge_request%5Block_version%5D=  \n```\n\n4.

Production would be on top of the elasticsearch cluster itself, and have clear [runbooks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/merge_requests/1059) about how to turn it off and prevent it from monopolizing sidekiq, but we would be in charge of actually getting the content into the cluster, testing the feature, and eventually enabling and maintaining it, in a manner analogous to how the Gitaly rollout was performed, or the GCP migration.\n\nIn service of that, I'll be investigating the two outstanding things @mwasilewski\\-gitlab identifies in his issue:\n\n- [x] Elasticsearch indexing and Elasticsearch search settings not being completely respected\n    - This is fixed in 12.0, I validated search with indexing on, but ES off, at instance, group, and project level\n    - [x] Create an issue for \"Project dropdown at global scope only shows personal projects\" https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/50981\n- [x] Very long-lived `ElasticIndexerWorker` jobs\n     - Fixed in 12.0, indexing gitlab-ce takes just 30 minutes. Should be sufficient.\n- [x] Broken group-level search for projects needs fixing: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12091\n\nI'll also be investigating the index more thoroughly, performing a thorough audit to make sure that:\n\n- [ ] All documents that should be indexed, are\n    - Some large snippets don't import: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12111\n- [x] All documents that should not be indexed, are not\n    - The only documents outside the gitlab-ce project that were indexed, were personal snippets. This is expected.\n- [x] Total document numbers are within expectations\n    - Around 743K documents for the gitlab-org group, dominated by gitlab-ce and gitlab-ee.\n    - Notes and commits dominate.\n- [x] Total index size is within expectations\n    - The gitlab-org group takes ~3.2GiB of index size\n    - The gitlab-ce project by itself takes ~450MiB\n- [x] Indexing wikis works\n    - [x] Create an issue to improve rake task performance, or simply integrate into `IndexRecordService`\n- [x] Search performance is improved at both group and project level\n- [x] Advanced search syntax works as expected\n- [x] Code and commit search works at group level\n- [x] Searches at global level still include items from the `gitlab-org` group\n- [x] Removing data from the index works\n    - [x] Create an issue for making `ElasticIndexedProject` work correctly when search is disabled https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12113\n    - [x] Create an issue to resolve the on-delete conflicts problem https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12114\n    - [x] Personal snippets are not removed, but are currently unmanaged \n- [x] All search tabs work at group and project scope\n- [x] Page 2 of searches work https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14258\n- [ ] ... other things to check ...\n\nA lot of this will be free exploration - just making sure I look at every aspect of operation of the feature, and searching for things that seem out of place or unusual.\n\ncc @DouweM @mdelaossa","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-01T16:35:36.612Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:01:20.331Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T16:41:52.720Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:12.0","requires production access","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":693520,"iid":34,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.1","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/07/22/gitlab-12-1-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:47:58.826Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:09.107Z","due_date":"2019-07-22","start_date":"2019-06-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/34"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":49,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-06-24","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11419","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":21,"completed_count":19},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"19 of 21 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11419","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11419/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11419/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11419","relative":"#11419","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11419"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":853,"epic":{"id":4555,"iid":853,"title":"Elasticsearch on GitLab.com MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/853","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24695158,"iid":28429,"project_id":278964,"title":"Git over HTTP LFS requests should generate an authorization header token","description":"The [Git LFS Deep Dive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E-aw6-z0rYd0346YhIWE7E9A65zISL9iIMAOq2zaw9E/edit#slide=id.g50cdd5255c_0_793) notes that we should be generating an authorization header for authenticating the download of LFS objects. However, a customer noticed their LDAP server was being hammered with bind queries.

That fact, coupled with the cost of context switching being a 15-40% negative drain on productivity, makes having multiple issues in progress incredibly inefficient. The goal of continuous delivery is to break customer value down into [small vertical feature slices](https://www.jamesshore.com/images/art-of-agile/figs/release_planning__horizontal_and_vertical_stripes.gif) that can be iteratively and incrementally deployed. [This article](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/release_planning.html) describes the problem from a quantitative standpoint and can be applied to the concept of both a broader release and a single unit of functionality capable of producing customer value.\n\n### Intended Users\nDev Managers, Execs, Team Leads, Product Managers, Project Managers\n\n### Proposal\nLists within Issue Boards need to be able to support a basic primitive such as \"Work in Progress\" (WIP) so teams have the flexibility to manually adjust the number of items in progress at any point in time for a given workflow stage. Teams need quick visual feedback on whether or not they are working within the limits. \n\nFor this MVC, we will only support WIP limits by issue count. Future iterations will include the ability to configure WIP Limits by other means such as total weight, issue type, etc. \n\nThe [Issue Board WIP Limits Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1628) contains more context, user research, and information on why we are prioritizing WIP Limits vs. a capacity line.  \n\n### What does success look like and how can we measure that?\n\n* **Adoption:** What percentage of boards are using WIP limits?\n* **Impact:** What is the throughput improvement for teams that adopt WIP Limits? (we will have to figure out how to track this, but theoretically we should be able to in a fairly straightforward manner).  \n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* A user can add, update, remove a `Max` work in progress limit per Issue List.\n* The visual appearance of the List changes in accordance with the List States below, and remains in effect when a List is in the collapsed state. \n* Sufficient telemetry implemented such that we can measure the \"success criteria\" outlined in the above section. \n\n**List States:**\n\n| State | Severity |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| `\u003c Max` | None |\n| `= Max` | Medium |\n| `\u003e Max` | High |\n\n### Design\n\nView specs here: https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/alexis/ee%2311403-WIP-limits-spec-previews/\n\n\n#### General flow\n![Flow](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/788ed3c4d8758cbce21c9f7613fc941c/Flow.png)\n\n#### Interactions\n![wipinteractions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/61fd11b2ddfab6f1c358f0d6a36589b3/wipinteractions.mov)\n\n\n#### Design requirements\n\n**Column List**\n\n*  Remove 1px border from the list weight and list issue count display.\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/e39cb734633b0889cd7a190701d5d6bb/image.png\"  width=\"300\" height=\"80\"\u003e\n\n*  Separate tooltips in the count by \"weight\" and \"issue count\" so they now read \"## total weight\" and \"## issues\". These can be triggered by hovering over the icon or the numbers. If a column has a WIP limit it reads \"## issues with a limit of ##\". \n*  Add new \"list settings\" button as a button-group to the list navigation. Use the settings icon for MVC.\n*  On hover of \"list settings\" icon trigger a tooltip that read \"List settings\"\n*  When a WIP limit is applied, display this after and next to the issue count, ie: 2 (ISSUES) /2 (WIP)\n   *  If the WIP limit is not maxed, the issue count in the list will be the same color as it is currently and match the WIP limit count.\n   *  If the WIP limit is maxed, the issue count in the list will change to our alert color red-500 (#db3b21)\n*  If WIP limit is maxed:\n   *  The background fill of the list changes to red-100 (#fbe5e1) to match our alert banner styling.\n*  When the List settings button in the list menu has been clicked:\n   *  Trigger a \"list selected state\" of the column:\n      *  Border shadow styling of column: x:0, y:1, blur:2, spread:0\n         *  Border shadow color of column: #000000, alpha/opacity 10% (this styling is the same as on our issue card box)\n      *  Add background fill to the list top menu- Background fill color: Inherit the label color with an opacity of 10% (you can see in the mocks it inherits the green label color)\n   *  Trigger List Setting sidebar. This interaction is similar to clicking on an issue card in a board.\n\n**List Settings Sidebar**\n\n*  Sidebar includes (EE) :\n   *  The list category with that corresponding label. These could be Label (displays the label), Milestone (displays the milestone), and Assignee (displays the assignee). *User can't edit*\n   *  Total issue count. *User can't edit*\n   *  Total weight. *User can't edit*\n   *  Work in Progress limit\n      *  Reuse the pattern for adding weight for MVC.\n   *  Position. *Future scope/stretch*\n   *  Delete list\n      *  Reuse the pattern for \"move issue\" for MVC.\n*  Reuse current sidebar patterns and interactions for MVC.\n\n*  Sidebar includes (CE) :\n   *  The list category with that corresponding label.

The use cases are numerous including sprint planning, but also for teams who use boards for tracking agenda items.\n\nThis issue is the MVC of more holistic [board capacity planning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6765) functionality.\n\n### Intended users\n\nDev Managers, Execs, Team Leads, Product Managers\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement a UI element to create a line break for each column in a board. If a line is created, it appears at the top and can be dragged to any point in a column. Lines can also be deleted. Issues on a board should be draggable above and below the line and the line should adjust visually as needed. Issues should only move above or below the line if manually dragged, they should not be automatically adjusted.\n\nFor this MVC, we will not allow naming of the line, nor multiple lines per list.\n\n![image](/uploads/a70b38585c76ecd452b5556ce6fd8c8a/image.png)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nNumber of lines created, in use, deleted should be measured to understand adoption of the feature.\n\n\n### Solution\n\n| Interaction flow | Anatomy |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![General_interactions](/uploads/4496081164e5aa10acbb65f6e7757eb0/General_interactions.png) |![Anatomy](/uploads/5415ba6b044d0e4e560abdb3eaf1cf17/Anatomy.png)| \n\n**Requirements**\n\n*  Move `remove list` option to the button group and use the associated button group button state behavior. I notice we use a different icon for the trash can than I see in the design pattern library. Can we investigate this?\n*  Remove 1px border from the list weight and list issue count display.\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/e39cb734633b0889cd7a190701d5d6bb/image.png\"  width=\"300\" height=\"80\"\u003e\n\n*  Add \"List line\" icon to button group (this icon is being created by the awesome @jeldergl to replace my mock but I will update this with the icon when we complete that)\n*  For MVC- let's treat this line almost as if it is a new issue card (interaction wise)\n     * A. User sees a new option within the button group.\n     * B. User sees list line tool tip on hover. Copy is: \"Add list line\".\n     * C. When the user clicks to add a list line, they see the line appear at the top of their list. There is an indicator that they can drag the line up and down (@jeldergl is working for an icon for us here to replace my mock, I will update when we complete that) as well as an option to remove the line.\n     * D. When a user clicks anywhere on the line (except for remove), the line becomes a card to further indicate it can be dragged and help with visibility when the line is overlapping other elements. We can hone this behavior (especially remove states) in future iterations.\n     * E. The line dragging behavior is similar to that of dragging an issue card for MVC.\n     * F. Once dropped, the line is back to its original styling.\n*  User sees tooltip \"Remove line\" when they hover over the remove icon in the line.\n*  User sees tooltip \"Move line\" when they hover over the drag and drop indication icon in the line.\n*  If a user moves all cards out of the list, the line remains. Lines remain under they are removed for MVC.\n*  If a user tries to move a line out of its list- preferred behavior would be that they are not able to do this and can only move the card up and down. For MVC, I think it should be fine if they can move a line out of a list and into another list *as long as a user is able to have multiple lines per list.*\n*  Stacking behavior: If a user has:\n\n```\nIssue A\nIssue B\n\n- line list -\n\nIssue C\n```\n\nWhen they add `Issue D` to the top of the list, their list now looks like:\n\n```\nIssue D\nIssue A\nIssue B\n\n- line list -\n\nIssue C\n```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and

Promises.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Do you think you could go through the test files migrated here and get rid of the `done` callbacks?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e We can make that a separate merge

This looks like a bug as comments posted on issues/merge requests are editable and deletable by Admins.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \n1. Create a public group and then create an epic inside it (Use GOLD membership).\n\n2. As it is public epic, anyone can comment on it by navigating on epic like `https://gitlab.com/groups/PrivateGroupofGuest/-/epics/1`. So just post a comment as any user.\n\n3. When, group owners/maintainer visits this epic, they see the comment which is posted by random user from gitlab. They dont find an option to EDIT/DELETE the comment!.\n\n4. This way any random users may spam the epic comment box and Group Owners/Maintainers cant even delete those comments!.\n\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nGroup owners/Maintainers can not delete comments posted on EPIC\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGroup owner/Maintainers should be able to delete/edit anyones comment like it is in issues and merge requests\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and probably on omnibus installations too\n\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nAnyone can spam the comments on `EPIC` from public groups and then group owners/maintainers can not even edit/delete the comments posted by others","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-29T15:26:15.329Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:09:00.090Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T10:19:09.547Z","closed_by":{"id":4056133,"username":"jeremymatos","name":"Jeremy Matos","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c972d878793ca2302186e5d8c0c0dd8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremymatos"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::3","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":693521,"iid":35,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/08/22/gitlab-12-2-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:48:32.567Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:20.799Z","due_date":"2019-08-22","start_date":"2019-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/35"},"assignees":[{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-07-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11381","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11381","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11381/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11381/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11381","relative":"#11381","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11381"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":20442905,"iid":11379,"project_id":278964,"title":"Stored XSS in Child Epics via ancestor Epic name","description":"**[HackerOne report #549747](https://hackerone.com/reports/549747)** by `near_` on 2019-04-28, assigned to `estrike`:\n\n## Background\n\nGitLab 11.7 [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8333) the ability to nest Epics with a maximum depth of 5. The \"Ancestors\" panel does not sanitize parent Epic titles correctly leading to stored XSS when a child Epic is loaded.  \n\n## Issue\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n1. As an authenticated GitLab.com user on a Gold plan, create a new group \n\n2. Within the group, create a new Epic (\"parent\") with the title `test'\u003e{{4-1}}\u003c/select\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u0026gt;\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e`\n\n3. Create another Epic (\"child\") with any title and take note of the URL. \n\n4. Return to the parent Epic \u003e click the plus button inside the \"Epics\" pane \u003e add the child epic URL\n\n5. Finally, browse to the child Epic and observe that `alert(document.domain)` is executed.\n\n![child_epic_xss.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/549747/477480/child_epic_xss.png)\n\n###  Context\n\nIt looks like the unsanitized HTML is being injected into a hidden sidebar `\u003cdiv\u003e` within the Ancestors pane:\n\n```  \n\u003cdiv aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"d-none\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003etest'\u0026gt;{{4-1}}\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u0026gt;\u003cimg src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert(document.domain)\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \n```  \nI used https://gitlab.com/groups/near_h1_group_a/-/epics/7 as the parent Epic and https://gitlab.com/groups/near_h1_group_a/-/epics/8 as the child Epic (both are located within a private Group).\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could use this stored XSS on GitLab.com and self-hosted CE/EE instances to execute arbitrary JavaScript (e.g. for info theft / taking malicious actions) in victims' sessions with minimal user interaction.\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments

We want to support a user that has secret stored in Vault and have it used by GitLab. \n\n### Intended users\n\nThis feature will be used by automation developers who need to access secrets as part of their build and deploy process, providing a new and more secure way to do so.\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe are supporting the leanest approach for GitLab read a secret from Vault and bring that into a CI Job, using the JWT as an authentication method. The secret would be stored in Vault and retrieved from Vault via the yaml. \n\nWe'll add support for the following syntax to `.gitlab-ci.yml` in order to define Vault servers and secrets from the syntax in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218746. We will also be delivering the Runner configuration as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212252. \n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  # production/s3 is a `path:`, where `secret-key` is a fieldname\n  # @path/to/engine indicates a path used by `kv-v2` which we consider to be a default engine\n  VAULT_SIMPLE_SECRET:\n    vault: production/s3/secret-key\n\n  VAULT_SIMPLE2_SECRET:\n    vault: production/s3/secret-key@path/to/engine\n\n  VAULT_COMPLEX_SECRET:\n    vault:\n      engine:\n        name: kv-v2\n        path: path/to/engine\n      path: production/s3\n      field: secret-key\n```\n\nGitLab will parse this section and provide the data to the Runner as part of the job request response. Runner will then authenticate with Vault, fetch the secrets and save them under a path that will be stored in the specified ENV variable (similar to how \"File\" type CI variables work).\n\nIn the first iteration the Vault server definition (url and auth method path) will be defined with CI variables, later we'll add UI for this with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218677.\n\n### Other considerations \n* Start with YAML --\u003e in the future move this into a group or project settings like the Variables framework - will always need to have a section in the YAML \n* Once we have the section in the job YAML, we should continue to expand the YAML  \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nPermissions are configured at Vault by using policies, roles, and when configuring the auth method. This should be documented with example, similar to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/authenticating-with-hashicorp-vault.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- This will need documentation on how this works \n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n- Most of the secret management will be contained on the Vault side. For example, secrets expiration and storage will be handled on the Vault Side \n\n_ We'll need vault instance accessible over the internet in order to test this\n\n### Links / references\n\n- [Vault POC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9981)\n- Slack Channel (Internal Link only) [#f_vault_integration_secrets_mgmt](https://gitlab.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=f_vault_integration_secrets_mgmt)\n- [Inject dynamic environment variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/3699)\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000K9Bgw\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0064M00000VMjeP","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-26T21:07:28.572Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T08:00:20.723Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T05:45:19.610Z","closed_by":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"labels":["Alliances","Alliances - Hashicorp","CEO Interest","CI variables","Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Secrets Management","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","Product Vision FY20","Release::P1","[Deprecated] Category:Runner","backend","breadth","cicd::active","customer","customer+","devops::release","direction","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"}],"author":{"id":1514779,"username":"brendan","name":"Brendan O'Leary 🐢","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5a575069d12106f79c0c97dfb3ef917?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brendan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"user_notes_count":228,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":60,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28321","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28321","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28321/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28321/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#28321","relative":"#28321","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#28321"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2875,"epic":{"id":30992,"iid":2875,"title":"Fetch \u0026 Configure Secrets","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2875","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24694690,"iid":28307,"project_id":278964,"title":"Unable to view Settings -\u003e Repository after adding Mirror Repository (Error 500)","description":"Hi all!

An administrator, or more fine-grained per project, the owner can create certain push rules. The goal of these push rules is avoiding to push certain commits to the repository, which violate one of the push rules. If a commit violating one of the push rules is pushed to the repository, a pre-check gets executed, which decides a commit attempt should be rejected. Therefore, the user gets an error message indicating the commit does not follow the rules.\n\nOn the other hand, GitLab supports creating merge requests by writing an email address to a special address. If the email contains a `.patch` file as an attachment, the commits from this patch file are applied and pushed to the Repo. \n\nHowever, this step does not check for the push rules. This allows creating commits with content, that violates the configured push rules. It allows for example to push commits violating the commit message syntax, pushing an unsigned commit, pushing unwanted content (blacklisted secret files or bypassing regex), commits from unverified users, ...\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nTested on GitLab.com 11.9.4-ee with a Gold Trial.\n\n1. Create a repository with a Readme initialized  \n2. You then have to create one dummy merge request, e.g, by pushing some branch and create a new MR. The only purpose is that the empty state of `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/merge_requests` does not show the incoming merge request email, which is required for the later steps.  \n3. Go to `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/merge_requests`. At the bottom, there is a link opening a modal, which shows you the incoming merge request email. This email address looks similar to `incoming+\u003cnamespace\u003e-\u003cproject-name\u003e-\u003cproject-id\u003e-\u003ctoken\u003e-request@incoming.example.gitlab.com`  \n4. Configure the push rules of the project under `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/settings/repository`  \n   * Check `Committer restriction`  \n   * Check `Reject unsigned commits`  \n   * Check `Check whether author is a GitLab user`  \n   * Check `Prevent committing secrets to Git`  \n   * Change `Commit message` to `Fixes \\d+\\..*`  \n   * Change `Commit message negative match` to `ssh\\:\\/\\`  \n   * Change `Commit author's email` to `@example.com$`  \n   * Change `Prohibited file names` to `(jar|exe)$`  \n5. Now clone the repo locally  \n6. In the local repo, create a branch named `bypass`, create a new file `test.exe` and a new file `id_dsa`  \n7. Add all created file to the git repo and commit it (unsigned) with the commit message `Bypassing push rules ssh://foo.bar`  \n8. Create a git patch of the last commit by using the command `git format-patch -n HEAD^`  \n9. Open the patch file and change the `From` line to e.g. `Lin Jen \u003clin@yen.com\u003e`. Of course, you could also change the commit auther and commiter email git before.   \n10. Create and send a new Email with the following content  \n  * Recipient address: Merge email address from above (Step 3)  \n  * Subject: bypass  \n  * Body: MR bypassing the push rules  \n  * Attachment: The patch file created before  \n11. The email created a new merge request with  \n  * a commit, which is unsigned \u003c- violating the rule that othe commit message rulere accepted  \n  * a commit from Lin Jen (lin@yen.com) \u003c- violating the author's email rule  \n  * a commit from Lin Jen (lin@yen.com) \u003c- violating the rule that only verified emails can be used in pushed commits  \n  * a commit from Lin Jen (lin@yen.com) \u003c- violating the rule whether the author is a GitLab user  \n  * a commit with message `Bypassing push rules ssh://foo.bar` \u003c- violating the commit message rule  \n  * a commit with message `Bypassing push rules ssh://foo.bar` \u003c- violating the commit message negative match  \n  * a file `test.exe` \u003c- violating the prohibited file names rule  \n  * a file `id_dsa` \u003c- violating the secrets rule\n\nThe only push rule, which seems to be enforced is the branch name push rule.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nPush rules are enforced also for commits created by an email.

Since we will allow [active scans soon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7182#note_163953546), it means users can accidentally hit live webservers and potentially damage them.\n\nMany customers have asked for this feature because they are afraid of accidentally taking down their production environment.\n\n# Proposal\n\nIf the user has set `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED=\"true\"`, the URL specified by `DAST_WEBSITE` must respond to a `GET` request that has a `Gitlab-DAST-Request` header with the header `Gitlab-DAST-Confirmation`. The headers do not need a value.\n\nIn this issue, we have to implement that `GET` request.\n\nDon't forget to add instructions to our DAST docs! We should have a few sample configurations for how to add headers to an app.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n**Given** I am a customer setting up DAST  \n**When** I look at the setup instructions  \n**Then** I am informed that I need to configure my app to respond to the full scan permissions request before I can run a full scan.\n**And** I am warned to make sure that the configuration only exists in my test environments (NOT production).\n\n**Given** I am a customer with DAST full scan enabled  \n**When** I launch a DAST scan through CI or another means  \n**And** my application responds to the DAST full scan permissions request  \n**Then** I see my DAST scan run successfully.\n\n**Given** I am a customer with DAST full scan enabled  \n**When** I launch a DAST scan through CI or another means  \n**And** my application _does not_ respond to the DAST full scan permissions request  \n**Then** I see a message that I must configure my application to respond to the permissions request  \n**And** I see a link to the docs on how to do so.\n\n## Rollout\n\nThis is a breaking change, so it must have a **feature flag**.\n\nIn %\"12.2\" we want the feature to be enabled if a customer:\n* sets up DAST full scan after the release (determined by the `created_at` for the `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED` variable in the `ci_variables` table)\n* if administrators explicitly flip the feature flag\n\nWe will make a future decision on when to make this behavior the default for all users, based on what we learn from and feedback we receive on this issue.\n\n/cc @kencjohnston @twoodham @dappelt","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-24T18:19:43.534Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T21:17:22.367Z","closed_at":"2019-09-23T13:44:52.519Z","closed_by":{"id":4310743,"username":"sethgitlab","name":"Seth Berger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4310743/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethgitlab"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::secure","direction","group::dynamic analysis","priority::1","security","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"}],"author":{"id":30915,"username":"plafoucriere","name":"Philippe Lafoucrière","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/30915/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/plafoucriere"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11301","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11301","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11301/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11301/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11301","relative":"#11301","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11301"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":20318584,"iid":11298,"project_id":278964,"title":"Flaky spec: \"API::Namespaces PUT :id/gitlab_subscription when authenticated as an admin when namespace is not found returns a 404 error\" / ee/spec/requests/api/namespaces_spec.rb:272","description":"Job [#201684272](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/-/jobs/201684272) failed for 138afd05ee571dd7c901987c5ea58dd9aaa2391b:\n\n```\n  1) API::Namespaces PUT :id/gitlab_subscription when authenticated as an admin when namespace is not found returns a 404 error\n     Failure/Error: expect(response).to have_gitlab_http_status(404)\n       expected the response to have status code 404 but it was 200.

However, since GitLab uses the Docker API, we run into problems where updating a group or projects path will break the connection to Docker. \n\nWe've solved this problem for projects by checking to see if the project has any images/tags before allowing the user to change the project name/path. If there are images/tags, the user is alerted that they cannot rename their project because registry tags exist. [Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-TS-mbw30\u0026feature=youtu.be)\n\nHowever, for groups we do not do the same check and prevent users from breaking their container registry. \n\n### Intended users\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sasha)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-devon)\n- [Systems Administrator](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney)\n\n### Further details\n- More details about renaming/transferring groups [here](https://gitlab.com/help/user/group/index#transferring-groups)\n- GitLab does provide [redirect for path changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/index.html#redirects-when-changing-repository-paths), but that does not apply to the container registry. In order to address the core issue of allowing users to move groups/projects, we will need to do something similar. \n\n### Proposal\nWhen a user attempts to rename their group by: \n\n1. navigating to their group's settings \u003e General page.\n2. Expanding the Path, transfer, remove section.\n3. Entering a new name under Change group path.\n4. Clicking Change group path.\n\nCheck to see if there are any images/tags within the group and prevent the user from making the change with the same warning modal we use for projects. \n\n**Copy: **\n\"Cannot update the path because it contains images in the container registry.

Commits don't get indexed. However, the ruby indexer implementation is slated for removal: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6481 (scheduled for %12.1),  and doesn't work in non-NFS deployments anyway. \n\nElasticsearch wiki indexing is **currently broken** for non-NFS deployments. If we've advertised that scenario as working, then we need to upgrade this to an ~S2 ~bug, I think.\n\n### Intended users\n\nInstance administrators\n\n### Proposal\n\nEnhance gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer so that it can handle the wiki case. In practice, this means re-using the existing repository parsing code, and writing the content to slightly different field names.\n\nWe'll need to modify gitlab-ee so that - instead of directly calling `project.wiki.index_blobs`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/ee/app/models/concerns/elastic/wiki_repositories_search.rb#L26 - it enqueues an `ElasticCommitIndexerWorker` for the **wiki project**, instead.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo changes required\n\n### Documentation\n\nNo changes required\n\n### Testing\n\nWe have existing tests for searching a wiki repository. We could prevent regressions by making them use `gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer` - it's work that's implicitly scheduled for %12.1 anyway, so a headstart would be nice.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIn a gitlab-ee HA deployment that doesn't have NFS / shared filesystems enabled, wikis can be successfully indexed and searched\n\n### What is the type of buyer?

However, `requirements.txt` doesn’t make sense for all projects (e.g., libraries) to have since they don’t need the absolute dependency resolution but can make do just fine with the relative dependencies as given in `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n### Intended users\r\n\r\n~\"Persona: Software developer\" \r\n\r\n### Further details\r\n\r\nPython support for Dependency Scanning is implemented in [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python), which only supports pip and pipenv at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn [main.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/analyze.go), gemnasium-python [detects the `PackageManager`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/analyze.go#L54), then delegates the [installation of the dependencies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/analyze.go#L59) and the [generation of the dependency graph](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/analyze.go#L63).\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nCreate a new package manager handler in `gemnasium-python`:\r\n\r\n- update [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python)\r\n  - create a new package manager handler\r\n    - create a new Go file in [pkgmgr](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/pkgmngr)\r\n    - declare a Go struct implementing [`PackageManager`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/pkgmngr/pkgmngr.go#L10)\r\n    - implement `InstallDependencies` by calling `python setup.py`\r\n    - reuse code from [pkgmngr/pip.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/pkgmngr/pip.go) to generate the dependency graph\r\n  - change the detection logic implemented in [NewPackageManager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/pkgmngr/pkgmngr.go#L23), return the new package manager handler when there's a `setup.py` but no file pip or pipenv can handle\r\n  - change [plugin/plugin.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/plugin/plugin.go) to respond to `setup.py`\r\n  - optionally, introduce a plugin architecture for the package managers\r\n    - iterate and delegate in [plugin/plugin.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/plugin/plugin.go)\r\n    - iterate and delegate in [NewPackageManager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.2.4/pkgmngr/pkgmngr.go#L23)\r\n  - publish new release\r\n- update [dependency-scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/dependency-scanning)\r\n  - update Go dependency `gemnasium-python`, so that Dependency Scanning responds to `setup.py`\r\n  - publish new release\r\n- create new test project, or add specific branch to existing one\r\n- update GitLab documentation\r\n\r\n### Permissions and Security\r\n\r\nNo changes to current behavior.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers) should be changed to denote that `setup.py` will be supported in addition to `requirements.txt`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nIt needs to test correct behavior in cases where more than one of `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` exist and possibly give conflicting dependency information. (`requirements.txt` being the description of a full environment at a specific version should probably take precedence, followed by whatever order of `setup.py` that `pip` does.)\r\n\r\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\r\n\r\nSuccess would be that a project that has a `setup.py` specified but no `requirements.txt` is still able to utilize the Dependency Scanning CI security feature.\r\n\r\n### What is the type of buyer?\r\n\r\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \r\n\r\n### Links / references\r\n\r\n* https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers\r\n* https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-21T08:57:45.868Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T15:34:21.229Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T11:52:52.860Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","backend-weight::3","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":55717,"username":"Freso","name":"Freso","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/55717/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Freso"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11244","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11244","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11244/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11244/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11244","relative":"#11244","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11244"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1400,"epic":{"id":7868,"iid":1400,"title":"Improve Dependency Scanning support for Python","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1400","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":20213361,"iid":11241,"project_id":278964,"title":"Epic API missing `web_url` field","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThis is a really helpful field for any kind of scripting so that the API consumer can easily print a link to the epic in the Web UI.
