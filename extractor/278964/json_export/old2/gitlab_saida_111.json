Cache it. This was already implemented for project check at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f59512fc603c2ac1b6c6a3904e9efa5960814edd/ee/app/models/ee/application_setting.rb#L150\n2. We also optimized the query for projects at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/30612 to make it much faster. We can probably optimize the query for namespaces as well.\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-03T08:02:17.610Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:34:47.897Z","closed_at":"2020-09-07T07:55:52.438Z","closed_by":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","GitLab Starter","bug::performance","devops::data_stores","direction","group::global search","release post item","release post item::in review","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},{"id":5724558,"username":"JohnMcGuire","name":"John McGuire","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5724558/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JohnMcGuire"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244846","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/244846","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/244846/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/244846/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#244846","relative":"#244846","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#244846"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1506,"epic":{"id":8514,"iid":1506,"title":"Search Performance","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1506","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70666932,"iid":244839,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove unnecessary index from vulnerabilities table","description":"As part of the MR !40755, we've introduced a new compound index on `(project_id, id)` to speed up the background migration.

 \"Pipelines for merged results\" and \"Merge Train\" check boxes","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe existence of a single checkbox that enables both \"Pipelines for merged results\" and \"Merge Train\" does not allow users to selectively enable only \"Pipelines for merged results\" or only \"Merge Train\".\n\n### Further details\n\nIn GitLab 12.0, [Merge Trains was shipped](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9186). At that time, [Pipelines for merged results](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results/) and [Merge Train](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results/merge_trains/) check boxes were **separate** and users were able to disable \"Merge Train\" even if \"Pipelines for merged results\" was enabled. Merge Train was disabled by default because it had a scalability issue.\n\nIn GitLab 12.1, [Merge Trains was enabled **whenever \"Pipelines for merged results\" is enabled**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11222) because the scalability issue was resolved. \"Pipelines for merged results\" and \"Merge Train\" check boxes were **combined** into a single check box.\n\nOne reason for the problem to solve is stated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/delivery/-/issues/1107 that users may not want to enable \"Merge Trains\" due to the CI cost increase.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Separate the \"Pipelines for merged results\" and \"Merge Train\" into 2 checkboxes.

Now that [status, start_time and end_time have been added to SAST, CS, DS reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217790), we had to update the `compare_reports.sh` to [ignore scan.start_time and scan.end_time when comparing reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/144) in order to allow comparing two reports with different timestamps.\n\nThe pattern when adding variable fields, such as [timestamps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/c625e262d936f48c3995f1927c6d3dd8dbf8816d/scripts/compare_reports.sh#L38-39) or [versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/c625e262d936f48c3995f1927c6d3dd8dbf8816d/scripts/compare_reports.sh#L37) has been to delete them from the reports before comparing them, thereby ignoring any variation between the values.  However, doing this may result in false negatives, for example, if someone were to remove the `start_time` or `end_time` from the scanner code, the qa tests would not fail, because these fields are ignored.\n\nI attempted to solve this issue by [keeping the report keys while replacing the values with placeholder text](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/144#note_402241936), but it made the `jq filter` command much more complex:\n\n```\njq_filter=\"del(.version) |\n           del(.scan.scanner.version) |\n           .scan.start_time |= if .!=null then \\\"$TIME_PLACEHOLDER_VALUE\\\" else \\\"$KEY_NOT_EXISTS\\\" end |\n           .scan.end_time |= if .!=null then \\\"$TIME_PLACEHOLDER_VALUE\\\" else \\\"$KEY_NOT_EXISTS\\\" end |\n           del(.vulnerabilities[]|.location.image) |\n           del(.vulnerabilities[].id) |\n           del(.remediations[].fixes[].id) |\n           .vulnerabilities |= map_values(.links |= (. // [])) |\n           .vulnerabilities |= map_values(.identifiers |= (. // [])) |\n           (.. | arrays) |= sort\"\n```\n\nIt also didn't make sense to only changing this for the `start_time` and `end_time` fields without addressing all the other fields that have been deleted, such as `.scan.scanner.version` or `.vulnerabilities[]|.location.image`\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nQA stage should fail when comparing reports that don't have the same keys.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for original proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nAdd a second comparison stage to the [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/c625e262d936f48c3995f1927c6d3dd8dbf8816d/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script to ensure that both reports have the same keys.\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nAdd a second validation stage to the [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/c625e262d936f48c3995f1927c6d3dd8dbf8816d/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script to ensure that the generated report JSON can be validated against the [Security Report Schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for original implementation plan\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nAs stated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244829#problem-to-solve the solution could be to either nullify all the non-comparable value fields or instead go through and verify that the fields exist in a second validation command. For this purpose a list of all currently nullified fields can be created and then iterated through the list verifying that the key exists in the object via the `has` or a recursive lookup in every object checking that the current path matches the keys of this object.\n\n- [x] modify compare_reports.sh to do a member field check as described above\n- [x] test against 2 different reports (e.g. different scan times) and verify they continue to work\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n- add another stage to the [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/c625e262d936f48c3995f1927c6d3dd8dbf8816d/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script which does the following:\n   1. Determines the `schema version` of the report by extracting it from the JSON file\n   1. Uses this `schema version` value _and the report type_ to fetch the appropriate schema from the [Security Report Schemas dist directory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/tree/master/dist). For example, if the `schema version` is [7.0.1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/aaf39c0c41d664b8095de00f4077266f608acc0f/test/fixtures/gl-sast-report-without-messages-field-version-7.0.1.json#L2) and the report type is `sast`, the following schema should be retrieved:\n\n      https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/raw/v7.0.1-rc1/dist/sast-report-format.json\n \n   1. Verify the generated report JSON against the schema retrieved above using [py3-jsonschema](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86/py3-jsonschema)\n   1. If the verification fails, a warning message should be output to explain why and an exit code of 0 will be returned and the QA stage will succeed. As a follow up, another MR [feat: Use custom exit code for schema validation failures](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/198) will change this behaviour to return a `65` exit code and update the QA stages to `allow_failure` if this error code is encountered.\n- add `rspec` tests to verify the above behaviour against a variety of fixture files\n- test the updated `compare_reports.sh` script to ensure\n   1. all existing QA stages still pass\n   1. if the JSON schema validation fails, an error is output:\n   \n

Or did you plan to be addressed it as part of this issue? If so we should prioritize this issue, but I would prefer to create a separate issue for it.\n\nThis is partially related to `epicId` issue filter we support when filtering issues (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40602/diffs#b4a55cc4650aa43adfad3ed73399b0c155468278_0_10), this param accepts only single epic and reflects issue board filtering by an epic. Perhaps we should pass list of simlanes epic IDs as a separate argument to `filters` argument for `BoardListIssuesResolver` but I'll leave this up to whoever takes this

This prevents admin from doing automated clean-up on existing projects and from truly lowering the cost of their container registry.\n\nWe recently added throttling to the feature to improve its performance and scalability. Now, prior to enabling the feature for all projects on GitLab.com, we will test with internal-GitLab projects and a subset of customers that have volunteered to be part of the initial rollout. \n\nThis work has become more important as we consider the deployment and migration of a major new version of the container registry. We want to ensure that GitLab.com customers have a seamless, fast migration to the new registry. But, if your project has many thousands of container images in the registry, it will take longer to migrate which introduces greater risk to your workflows. \n\nSo, prior to the migration, GitLab is going to drive as much adoption of the cleanup policies as possible. This will make the migration much easier and hopefully allow us to deliver some really exciting new container registry features. \n\n### Proposal\n\nOver the past several milestones, we've enabled cleanup policies for historical projects by request. Thank you to those of you who have helped us to beta test this feature at scale. \n\nNow that we've seen the policies working, we will begin to enable the policies for more and more projects on a percentage basis. \n\nOne important note is that once the policy is enabled for those projects, we'll need a way to alert the Project Admin that they should turn them on. \n\n#### Rollout\n\nThe below represents our planned percentage-based rollout. \n\n1. 1%\n1. 2%\n1. 3%\n1. 4%\n1. 5%\n1. 10%\n1. 15%\n1. 25%\n1. 40%\n1. 60%\n1. 80%\n1. 100%\n\n#### Metrics\nThere are a variety of metrics that will be used during the rollout of the feature. This section will focus on activity metrics:\n\n1. What % of GitLab.com Projects have a Cleanup policy enabled\n1. What % of the above are active\n\nWe can also reference the Package activity dashboard to view:\n- [Submit vs. Cancel in Cleanup policy

As we looked at the charts there are a few endpoints that stood out and warrant an investigation to find any issues and determine if any optimizations can be made. \n\nThe npm upload and metadata endpoints could have better numbers. The npm upload is slow and that’s explained by the fact that the [upload is not accelerated by workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/-/issues/226) so that rails has to do all the heavy lifting.\n\nHowever, it's not clear why the metadata is slow. \n\n### Tasks to  Evaluate\n\nInvestigate the npm get metadata event and see if it can be optimized to perform better. \n- View the

However, it is only intended to be used for abuse reports.  This generic name is confusing to users, product managers and and engineers.  For example, it was originally proposed in a non-abuse feature (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14432#note_405567666).  We should change the name to clearly convey its intended use.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe setting should be `abuse_notification_email` instead of `admin_notification_email`.\n\n### Further details\n\nBecause this attribute [appears in the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/settings.html#list-of-settings-that-can-be-accessed-via-api-calls) it would need to follow the [deprecation guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/index.html).  We could likely convert it to an alias during the deprecation period, as we aren't removing this feature - only renaming it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-01T17:06:04.943Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T18:30:36.222Z","closed_at":"2020-10-11T13:49:16.990Z","closed_by":{"id":100770,"username":"tnir","name":"Takuya Noguchi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/100770/canstock6553672_288.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tnir"},"labels":["Community contribution","api","backend","maintenance::refactor","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243772","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243772","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243772/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243772/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#243772","relative":"#243772","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#243772"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70587167,"iid":243762,"project_id":278964,"title":"Public Runner Minutes Not Resetting (Sept 1, 2020)","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen using public runners on the default tier, we are experiencing an issue with minutes not reset.

This query is quite expensive for groups with a large number of issues.\n\nBy visiting a group page with the performance bar enabled we can see that the first query is `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"issues...\"` and the load time being ~900ms.\n\nThe query for counting open issues is performed in [`GroupsHelper`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/helpers/groups_helper.rb#L65) and called from [the sidebar partial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/layouts/nav/sidebar/_group.html.haml#L1).\n\n## Proposal\n\n- We could try to optimise the way we calculate this count values and reduce loading times of all group pages. \n\nFor example, when looking at the [sidebar for the project level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/layouts/nav/sidebar/_project.html.haml#L90), the count for Issues is calculated using [`Projects::OpenIssuesCountService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/projects/open_issues_count_service.rb), that caches the total count number. This was introduced [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commit/6ec53f5d488fcdc6ef2b076c37a46525b5176224) to handle the same problem at the Project level.\n\nCould we extend this functionality to cover the Group level?\n\n- From discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243753#note_462806542 we could cache this count only when over a certain limit, and display it rounded to thousands to indicate inaccuracy. \n\n## Screenshots\n\n| Open issues count | COUNT query | Expected appearance for rounded count |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_15.41.19](/uploads/278df119f7bb1c89899e4ea509b233fb/Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_15.41.19.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_15.41.34](/uploads/1bacbfebce41faa8f53cf05520dc0b7a/Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_15.41.34.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_15.42.22](/uploads/b02a49f7ed87bf884ae05f74c9b4aaa7/Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_15.42.22.png) |","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-01T14:19:34.045Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T09:21:54.135Z","closed_at":"2021-02-01T11:56:26.725Z","closed_by":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"},"labels":["UX","backend","bug::performance","devops::plan","group::product planning","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"}],"author":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243753","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243753","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243753/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243753/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#243753","relative":"#243753","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#243753"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70579747,"iid":243750,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display messages and warning for partially executed cleanup policies","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n~frontend follow up of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208193.\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208193, cleanup policies execution will have some limits.

The issue this MR is trying to solve is the prevention of the form's submission on Enter. But here we're only testing for the search to be made. It's a bit misleading because if you try with a small modification of this `describe`:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```javascript\n    \u003e beforeEach(() =\u003e {\n    \u003e       mock\n    \u003e         .onGet(TEST_SEARCH_ENDPOINT, { params: { search: 'TEST_SEARCH', scope: 'milestones' } })\n    \u003e         .reply(200, []);\n    \u003e     });\n    \u003e \n    \u003e     it('should trigger a search', async () =\u003e {\n    \u003e       expect(mock.history.get.length).toBe(0);\n    \u003e \n    \u003e       findSearchBox().vm.$emit('keydown', new KeyboardEvent({ key: ENTER_KEY }));\n    \u003e       await axios.waitForAll();\n    \u003e \n    \u003e       expect(mock.history.get.length).toBe(1);\n    \u003e     });\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e you'll notice that the very first expectation that is supposed to be passing just fine is failing the test. Apparently we do not reset the mock properly here, hence catch some call to `/api/v4/projects/8/milestones` instead of `TEST_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Moreover, `mock.history.get.length` doesn't get updated after the Enter is clicked. And this is odd.

We have been noticing a lot of abuses and unnecessary pipeline runs on those projects.\n\nPer our pricing policy, public projects are included within the CI/CD minutes usage limit offered to free tier users. All free tier users should have CI minutes enforced on their public projects.\n\n## Proposal \n\n**Implementation**\n\n1. Remove the check for the namespace creation date from the [condition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/84c13147be883d14561570616e1237d9166f378e/ee/app/models/ee/project.rb#L803-804) and apply the cost factor `0.008` to public projects (retroactively).\n\n**Release Plan** - could be done in the feature flag issue.\n1. Release the change behind a feature flag so we can control exactly when to enable it.\n1. After the feature flag is enabled and before we remove it: set `public_projects_minutes_cost_factor: 0.008` for SaaS-only shared-runners. For this we could get a Gitlab.com admin to change the cost factor for each shared runner from `0` to `0.008`.\n1. Remove feature flag.\n\n## Expected impacts\n\nThis will impact primarily old public projects on Free plan:\n\n* if the public project is on Free plan, with `400 CI minutes limit` it can use up to 50,000 minutes or 250,000 if on old `2000 CI minutes limit`.\n  * any popular OSS projects should apply to the OSS program if they use more than 50,000 minutes - We may expect an uptick of requests so we should get the right team ready for that.\n* if the project is on any paid plan, they won't see any impact at this stage since the minutes they'll be able to use with cost factor `0.008` is sufficiently high.\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-01T06:58:05.643Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T20:15:21.432Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T08:50:13.558Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","FY23::Q2","GitLab Free","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","OKR","Open Source","Technical Writing","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","direction","feature::addition","group::pipeline execution","missed:14.10","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":4825194,"username":"supadhyaya","name":"Saumya Upadhyaya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cf4127d77f23c33ba9e7af56706d3adc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/supadhyaya"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":148,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":1,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243722","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243722","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243722/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243722/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#243722","relative":"#243722","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#243722"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5653,"epic":{"id":231355,"iid":5653,"title":"CI minutes limits for public projects on GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5653","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70551273,"iid":243709,"project_id":278964,"title":"[MR Analytics] Preload records for Throughput table","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nOn the MR Analytics page (which exists at the project level), the Throughput table loads rather slowly.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1.

BUT this feature has some logic flaws for example:\n\n* User with dev access to upstream project can add upstream project to his project pipeline subscription and when his access is removed from upstream project , the subscription still stays and owner dont have any option to remove the subscription\n\n![ps.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0a941f23-821a-46da-a08d-5d68a27e9283/ps.png)\n\nSo, even he is removed he can still snoop into the project as well as access other members private projects \n\n* There is no permission message given to owner when dev add the project to his personal project in pipeline subscriptions. So, he can easily add upstream project as subscription to his project without owner/maintainer permission\n\n* Since, attacker has added the project to his personal project pipeline subscription he can access owner or other members private data who can create tags in the upstream project.   \nWhen owner will creates a tag, pipeline will run in upstream project and then pipeline will run in attacker\u0026#39;s project where he has setup the pipeline subscription and created `.gitlab-ci.yml ` that uses `$CI_JOB_TOKEN`\n\n* Attacker achieved this by first adding the owner(victim) in his own project so when pipeline in upstream project succeeds a new pipeline will trigger in the attacker\u0026#39;s project where triggerer  will be the owner(victim) and in this whole process, he wont have any clue about this attack.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n(keeps all projects public)\n\n* Assume a test project where there is an owner and some devs who are working together  \n* `Dev1`(attacker)  creates a personal project and add owner project to his pipeline subscription `settings/ci_cd`  \n* `Dev1` creates a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in his project \n\n```  \nimage: \u0026#34;ruby:2.6\u0026#34;\n\nrspec:    \n  script:    \n    - git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:$CI_JOB_TOKEN@gitlab.com/victim/private_repo_name.git    \n    - cd private_repo_name    \n    - ls -lah .    \n    - cat README.md  \n\n\n```\n\n*  `Dev1` adds owner to his project as member with maintainer permission (so he can write to protected branch or we can add him as dev and remove protection).\n\n* As an owner create a tag in upstream project, this will trigger a new pipeline and after pipeline is successfully finished. A new pipeline will trigger in the attacker\u0026#39;s project by the owner without his consent and attacker gain access to his private data like projects, member only repositories, registry, etc.  \n\n#####  Impact\n\nThe pipeline subscription needs more careful consideration because this feature can provide more harm than good. The doc also don\u0026#39;t give more information about it. This feature can be abused by malicious user as I explained above and can grant him access to owner and other members of the project private data without their consent. For this attack to happen he only need to wait until someone creates a tag in upstream project.\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPipeline subscription can be abused by an attacker to gain access to owner and other members private projects, member only repositories, registry, etc.  \nOne more bug is that when user is removed from upstream project his subscription didn\u0026#39;t remove and owner dont have any option to remove it too.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThere are no. of ways we can fix it, here are some of my recommendations\n\n* Ask owner of the upstream project before adding the project to someone  project pipeline subscriptions  \n* Makes doc more clear regarding the usage, security and permissions  \n* When user is remove from upstream project then either remove subscriptions created by him or provide a button to the owner so that he can remove the subscription\n\n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com. Probably instance too (please check)\n\n####  Impact\n\nAttacker can access owner and other members private data without their consent by abusing pipeline subscriptions.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [ps.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0a941f23-821a-46da-a08d-5d68a27e9283/ps.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nWhen a downstream pipeline (from a subscription) is triggered we should not use [the upstream pipeline user](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/4559463feacc3b43af7ae03f82ee53959934abfb/ee/app/services/ci/trigger_downstream_subscription_service.rb#L7) but the author of the subscription. This mitigates the attack because `git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:$CI_JOB_TOKEN@gitlab.com/victim/private_repo_name.git` would be executed with the attacker permissions and not the victim one.\n\nThe problem is that we don't track *who* creates the subscription and the user we display in the subscriptions table is the project owner. I think we should:\n\n1. start tracking the author in a new `ci_subscriptions_projects.author_id` for newly created subscriptions.\n1. When triggering the downstream pipeline use `subscription.author || downstream_project.creator` so we can default to the project creator.\n2. Display the subscription author in the list of subscriptions.\n\nThis should make it irrelevant the following problem:\n\n\u003e when his access is removed from upstream project, the subscription still stays and owner dont have any option to remove the subscription.\n\nSince the downstream pipeline would run with the subscription's author permissions (attacker) and not the upstream pipeline user (the owner / victim). When the author is not available we could use the downstream project creator. If the project creator has left the project, another maintainer could remove the subscription and recreate it. Then new pipelines will run with the new subscription's author permissions.\n\nA similar solution had already been drafted in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2361.\n\n\nNote regarding `git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:$CI_JOB_TOKEN@gitlab.com/victim/private_repo_name.git`. With https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328553 being implemented, it could be sufficient to prevent such data leak.\n\nThe CI Job token runs in the context (scope) of the attacker's project. For `victim/private_repo_name` to be accessible it must be added to the job token scope of the attacker's project. The attacker must have at least `read_project` access in order to do that. In this case having the project setting enabled for CI job token scope would have been sufficient.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-01T00:37:43.389Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T03:10:42.949Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T08:00:06.958Z","closed_by":{"id":9043659,"username":"rshambhuni","name":"Rohit

It looks like this will also impact at least artifacts after it is migrated since the `not_expired` scope can apply on the primary-side.\n\nOne way to resolve this is to e.g. add `primary_replicables` which we can reuse in:\n\n* `replicables_for_geo_node` (which would `return primary_replicables if node.primary?` else apply primary \u0026 secondary scopes)\n* `primary_total_count` (exposed in the primary GeoNodeStatus and prometheus metrics)\n* Primary-side checksum success/failure counts and percentages (exposed in the primary GeoNodeStatus and prometheus metrics)\n* `ReplicableModel#needs_checksum?` (I guess this should check if it's in `replicables_for_geo_node` since it will probably be reused during verification implementation)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n(Also same for the Merge Request Diffs `has_external_diffs` scope)\n\nAlso, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34248/diffs#note_404842890:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nthought: WDYT about raising if not stored externally?

E.g. `needs_checksum?` and `checksummable?` should return falsey and not call `local?`.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-31T16:51:15.920Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:08:14.571Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T17:10:33.543Z","closed_by":{"id":660180,"username":"toon","name":"Toon Claes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/660180/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toon"},"labels":["devops::systems","group::geo","missed:13.4","section::enablement","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":660180,"username":"toon","name":"Toon Claes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/660180/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toon"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":660180,"username":"toon","name":"Toon Claes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/660180/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toon"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243567","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243567","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243567/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243567/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#243567","relative":"#243567","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#243567"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3761,"epic":{"id":74465,"iid":3761,"title":"Geo: Improve the self-service geo replication framework","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3761","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70513200,"iid":243564,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Gitleaks to v6.1.2 and add SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated.

Using these two options can lead to unintended commits being scanned and **in the worst case, the entire repo's history could be scanned**. A quick fix was put in to make scanning a range of commits deterministic by adding an option `commits=\u003clist of commits\u003e` and `commits-file=\u003cfile of a list of commits\u003e`. Instead of having gitleaks git library (go-git) decide what commits to scan via `git log`, gitleaks scans ONLY the commits specified in `commits-file` and `commits`. \n\nWe need to update gitleaks to the most recent version `v6.1.0` and add a `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS` variable to the secrets scanner so that gitleaks can accept a list of commits. \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Implementation\n- [x] Update Gitleaks to v6.1.2 in the Secrets analyzer\n- [x] Add `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS` to scan a range of commits\n- [x] Add a downstream test for range of commits\n- [x] Update template Secret-Detection.gitlab.yml to use `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS` instead of `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM/TO`\n\n\n## Alternative Approach:\nDisable the default `secret-detection` scan (which uses the problematic `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM/TO` options and use `secret_detection_default_branch` to match the same triggers as `secret-sast`. This would give us a little more breathing room and allow us to scope this issue for a future release.\n\n### Links / references\n- https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/releases/tag/v6.1.0\n-

In my case I use the GitLab Wiki to document the mathematical/physical background of a library developed in a GitLab repository. I would consider the *is-taking-too-long-to-respond* approach as a regression if it is applied on any rendered text in GitLab without distinction at all. The current solution prevents from loading a valid GitLab Wiki entry that was possible to load when it was created two years ago. [ref](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/61410#note_341952856)\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe can follow the solution we used for a similar problem with Mermaid charts (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/merge_requests/1059#note_441363524).\n\n- Enable the progressive rendering of math equations such that the original security flaw is not reintroduced and those that use larger math equations can use Issues/Wikis as they once could.\n- Original Proposal Suggestion: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/61410#note_292612809\n- Can we render only equations that appear on-screen, and render the rest as the user scrolls?

Imagine a user having a currently active session on GitLab.\n1. Admin resets the password of this user via the `admin/users` UI or via the `PUT /users/:id` API.\n1. Internally this sets the `user.password_expires_at` value to `Time.current` for the user. [Code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/0efddbd53dcb7dbcd49d9be3b169623cf582933f/app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb#L152)\n1. At this point, the user does not know their current account password.\n1. If this user tries to access any GitLab page, they will be logged out, since the password reset performed by the admin would have caused the user's session to be invalidated.\n1. Now, if the admin shares the changed password with the user (this is probable in case of self managed instances), this user can log in again.\n1. When they login with this new password, they are always redirected to the `profile/password/new` page due to this [before_action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L30) which checks if the password has expired. This check returns `true` because of the reason mentioned in step (3).\n1. This is by design, as no matter which page the user tries to access, they are prevented access and redirected to resetting their password via the `profile/password/new` page.\n1. However, currently if the user tries to \"Sign Out\" from this page for whatever reason, it is not possible to do so. (This is a very rare scenario though, as most users would just update the password from this page and most probably would not click Sign Out. However this could still be considered a bug as \"Sign Out\" is an action that should always be allowed.)\n\nThis becomes a user-experience problem, as the user is always stuck in the `profile/password/new`, without the ability to log-out.\n\n![Screenshot_2020-08-31_at_12.52.08_PM](/uploads/206ea71ef50f2ecea4fa090543c8354a/Screenshot_2020-08-31_at_12.52.08_PM.png)\n\nTheir only way of using the \"Forgot password\" mechanism now becomes opening GitLab in a new **incognito** window, which is less than desirable.\n\n### Possible fix\n\nUser should be allowed to sign out of GitLab, even if the password has expired. The [before_action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L30) check should be skipped for the sign-out action.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-31T07:24:07.636Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T16:06:42.145Z","closed_at":"2020-09-02T15:26:40.148Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","section::dev","security","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243444","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243444","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243444/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/243444/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#243444","relative":"#243444","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#243444"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70482696,"iid":243441,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add scan type to DAST Scanner Profile","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nTo allow users of DAST On-Demand scan to run either a passive scan or a passive scan and active scan, add scan type to DAST Scanner Profile ~GraphQL endpoints.
