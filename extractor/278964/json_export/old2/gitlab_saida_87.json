users - Disallow Password Auth","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. \n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen a user is created via SAML/SCIM, the enterprise group administrator expects that that account will only be able to authenticate through their IdP. Users with accounts provisioned by SAML/SCIM can reset their password and log into their accounts without going through their organization's IdP. This creates concern that the account can become compromised and an organization's data could be exposed. \n\n### Proposal \n\nIf a user is created by SAML/SCIM, then password auth should be disabled by default. The user should not be able to reset their password. \n\nOne use case to consider is when the user is removed from the top-level group. We have to have a way for the user to be re-added to the group if/when they go back through the SAML flow. \n\nWe should put this feature behind a feature flag until https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5299 is completed.\n\nNOTE: Without password auth, Git+HTTPS will not be available for users without 2FA https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#git-authentication-methods \n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n**What risks does this change pose to our availability?**\nThis is a low risk for GitLab SaaS and self managed availability.\n\n**How might it affect the quality of the product?**\nIn an extreme case, password auth may get disabled for non SAML/SCIM setup.\n\n**What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?**\n\n* Ensure that when a user is removed and re-added to SAML/SCIM enabled group, they are still unable to reset their password and login via password\n* Ensure that Git via SSH continues to

When any user tries to view the Markdown file in the browser, the **server-side** can consume 100% CPU usage for more than half a minute in the particular CPU core that handles the job. When multiple such Markdown file views happen simultaneously, all CPU cores can be occupied, which finally leads to DoS.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Known vulnerable attack surfaces. 1) Self-deployed GitLab server instance, version 13.7.3 (on Linux Debian 9); and 2) GitLab.com. Probably there exist many other vulnerable cases I haven't tested.   \n2 The attacker is privileged to edit a repository that belongs to the victim server.  The attacker uploads special Markdown files.  Multiple users (can also be attackers) try to visit and view the page at the same time, CPU cores can be all occupied. No user authentication is needed if the repository is set as publicly accessible.  \n######  To reproduce  \n1. A special Markdown file is uploaded to the victim GitLab server. For example, the `600000.md` in https://gitlab.com/ppnuts/PoC  \n2. A user tries to view the Markdown file by clicking on the file name. The user is then directed to https://gitlab.com/ppnuts/PoC/-/blob/master/600000.md  \n3. The user shall observe a loading shape on the screen without actually get the rendered content. Check screenshot below.  \n![loading.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/22c4a169-5b74-459c-927e-551b4ab17c9a/loading.png).  \nHowever, at this moment, the CPU on the server-side is 100% consumed. For example, when I do a `top` on the server-side, I can observe the process takes 100% CPU usage. Check screenshot below.  \n![top.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8f6bc2a1-d62a-4c0d-aa92-8f7610089022/top.png)\n\n4. If multiple users view the Markdown file simultaneously, all CPU cores can be occupied. Or simply just several browser instances.   \n5. After a long time, the client-side might show *Error loading viewer*. Check screenshot below.  \n![error.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/f47980a5-4188-4d64-9e83-2dbe2b5b24ee/error.png).  \n And the server-side CPU is then released.\n\n\n\n\n#####  Impact\n\nIf all CPU cores are occupied, other resources become unavailable. \n\n#####  Examples\n\nPlease check https://gitlab.com/ppnuts/PoC. \n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nClient-side cannot load/render the Markdown file on time; Server-side CPU is over-consumed. The whole services can be down if all CPU cores are occupied. \n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Markdown file shall be rendered correctly on time. \n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee above.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\nInstalled using `apt-get`.

This can be done using the API route. The same applies to groups. They can also be set to (for example) internal on the public gitlab.com website. \n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n(1. A GitLab instance administrator restricts the project visibility option 'internal', 'private' or 'public'. In this example, I will use the 'internal' option)  \n2. A non-privileged user creates a project (in this example, the id is 27236) and generates an access token for their account  \n3. The non-privileged user makes a PUT request to: '/api/v4/projects/27236' with the following body: '{\"visibility\": \"internal\"}' and their access token set in the 'Authorization' header like this: 'Bearer \u003caccess-token\u003e'.  \n4. The non-privileged user should now have their project visibility set to internal, even though this should not be possible.\n\n(5. The same actions can be applied to groups)\n\n#####  Impact\n\nWhen an administrator of a GitLab instance would like to keep all projects private or internal (for example, for universities and schools), students should not be able to modify their project visibility to public. This is also the case for our school. (I got permission to test this on my schools GitLab instance.) I cannot visit any project on my schools GitLab instance without logging in, except for one of my projects, which I have set to 'public'.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nThis bug is project related, but I do not know if settings (including project visibility) get exported with the project. \n\nTested GitLab versions: 13.7 and 13.8\n\nLink to my project: `\u003cREDACTED\u003e`\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen the PUT API request was made, the response code is 200 and the response body shows the project with the updated option.  \nAlso, on the project settings page, the grayed-out visibility option (restricted option) is selected.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe API response should have the status code 403 if a restricted project visibility was selected. Also, the option should not be updated in the project settings.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nI added a screenshot as an attachment.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\nThe bug was also present on my test GitLab instance, so i executed `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`:\n\n```  \nSystem information  \nSystem:         Debian 10  \nProxy:          no  \nCurrent User:   git  \nUsing RVM:      no  \nRuby Version:   2.7.2p137  \nGem Version:    3.1.4  \nBundler Version:2.1.4  \nRake Version:   13.0.1  \nRedis Version:  5.0.9  \nGit Version:    2.29.0  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.9  \nGo Version:     unknown\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:        13.7.4-ee  \nRevision:       368b4fb2eee  \nDirectory:      /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails  \nDB Adapter:     PostgreSQL  \nDB Version:     12.4  \nURL:            http://DEBIAN-VM-S4NDER.local  \nHTTP Clone URL: http://DEBIAN-VM-S4NDER.local/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:  git@DEBIAN-VM-S4NDER.local:some-group/some-project.git  \nElasticsearch:  no  \nGeo:            no  \nUsing LDAP:     no  \nUsing Omniauth: yes  \nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:        13.14.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default:      /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:              /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell  \nGit:            /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git  \n```\n\n####  Impact\n\nWhen an administrator of a GitLab instance would like to keep all projects private or internal (for example, for universities and schools), students should not be able to modify their project visibility to public.

It's most likely that the app is always interacting with \"the first index\" (since the single-file view is always index 0), but the reviews have many reviews per MR. That's just a guess, but the `reviewed` property doesn't seem to be updating when you cycle through files.\n\n## Fix\n\nThe first fix will be to move [this check, in the `mounted` callback for the diff file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75f114e374bb048a4d57b2d1bde7ff38ace78f8c/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_file.vue#L193-195) into a `'file.id'` listener in the `watch` section of that component.\n\nThe second fix will be for the checkbox itself, and is a bit more complicated.  \n\nThe `reviewed` property is provided to the `DiffFile` [by the Diffs app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75f114e374bb048a4d57b2d1bde7ff38ace78f8c/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/app.vue#L526). The available reviews are computed based on [what files are loaded into the app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75f114e374bb048a4d57b2d1bde7ff38ace78f8c/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/app.vue#L232) at any given time, and then [passed into the file itself as whether it's been `reviewed` (or not)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75f114e374bb048a4d57b2d1bde7ff38ace78f8c/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/app.vue#L526).

This method needs to be explicitly called in each controller action or model we want to track.\n\nSince we're in the early stages of defining what to track, I'd like to explore implementing action-level global tracking which will track every request and action to our Rails application including all CRUD methods, page requests, form posts, API calls, etc.\n\nThe tracking can be implemented in ApplicationController which is a lower-level controller that other controllers will inherit from. Example of what an implementation could look like:\n\n```\nclass ApplicationController \u003c ActionController::Base\n  after_action :track_action\n\n  protected\n  def track_action\n    Gitlab::Tracking.event(controller, action, args)\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n* This is an easy way to quickly build a dataset of events to explore and sift through. This is a similar approach to what we're doing on the frontend where we first track everything then afterwards define explicit structured frontend events. In this case, global tracking at the action-level allows us to capture everything on the backend then afterwards define explicit structured backend events.\n* Backend tracking is likely more accurate than frontend tracking (which has to deal with browsers). More data via backend tracking can be arguably more accurate than more data on the frontend.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n* The entire Rails application can be potentially slowed down. We'll need to do this async and optimize our use of [AsyncEmitter](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Ruby-Tracker#52-the-asyncemitter-class) to avoid slow downs.\n* Since this is a catch-all approach, we'll need to be careful to avoid tracking data not covered by our TOS.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-25T21:16:20.088Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T14:07:54.029Z","closed_at":"2022-11-09T14:07:54.007Z","closed_by":{"id":12806086,"username":"bastirehm","name":"Sebastian Rehm","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12806086/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bastirehm"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::analytics","group::product intelligence","section::analytics","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Configure your project's `Merge method` to be `Fast-forward merge` (under `Settings (General)` =\u003e `Merge Requests`)\n1. Create a feature branch off of the default branch\n1. Create a merge request for the feature branch\n1. Make any commit to the default branch (to make the feature branch un-mergeable)\n1. Navigate to the merge request, it should now have a Rebase button in place of the Merge button\n1. Click the \"Rebase\" button to rebase the merge request\n1.

On a secondary, when querying for verification work, assume the primary checksum exists, and attempt verification.\n1. If the primary checksum doesn't exist, then consider it a failed verification attempt.\n\nThis is not strictly wrong, but it is somewhat wasteful, and shows failures when the primary has not checksummed the resource yet. Progressive backoff limits the waste, but transient failures would be annoying to admins.\n\n#### Obstacle\n\n`needs_verification_count`, `verification_pending_batch`, and `verification_failed_batch` in `VerificationBatchWorker` should not return registries where the model record doesn't already have a checksum. The problem is, we must not perform a cross-database query, since that doesn't scale well, and these methods may be called frequently. So the knowledge of \"does the primary have a checksum?\" must already be \"copied\" to the registry table by some other process.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe currently exclude remote-stored blobs from verification. But if you enable the beta feature \"GitLab managed object storage replication\" https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/object_storage.html#enabling-gitlab-managed-object-storage-replication, then we will sync them. The secondary will attempt to verify those registries, but the logic to checksum them does not work for remote-stored things. And, the primary will never checksum them.\n\n#### Obstacle\n\n`needs_verification_count`, `verification_pending_batch`, and `verification_failed_batch` in `VerificationBatchWorker` should not return registries where the model record says it is remote-stored. The problem is, we must not perform a cross-database query, since that doesn't scale well, and these methods may be called frequently. So knowledge of \"is remote stored\" must already be \"copied\" to the registry table by some other process.\n\n## Proposal: A new `verification_state`: `verification_disabled`\n\n- [x] Add a `verification_state` called `verification_disabled`. It will include remote-stored things, and on secondaries, things that aren't checksummed on the primary yet.\n- [x] When a registry becomes synced, if the model record is not in verification_succeeded, then mark verification disabled\n- [x] When verifying a registry, if the model record is not in verification_succeeded, then mark verification disabled\n- [x] `VerifiableReplicator.verification_total_count` needs to exclude `verification_disabled`\n\nNo need to worry about losing `checksum_succeeded` events because worst-case, if it is a resource that *can* be verified, then the primary will *re*verify it later.\n\nFollow up created for

The best way we know to enable this need is to create a semgrep-based analyzer that we can use to compare against one we already have. Based upon usage, an analyzer which scans against python has been identified as our highest priority.\n\nThis new analyzer needs to conform to existing SAST features at their identified licensing levels.\n\n### Questions to Answer\n\n- [x] Should we have semgrep in a single analyzer project or many analyzer projects for each language/framework?\n  - [x] Can semgrep scan multiple languages/frameworks in a single run? This was answered today in a call with r2c, semgrep will scan as many languages for which you have rules defined. As that is true, we should start with a single analyzer project that will work on many projects.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n- [x] Create https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep\n- [x] Wrap [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) with our [analyzer pattern](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common)\n- [x] Bake semgrep rules into Docker image so that the rules are versioned.\n- [x] Limit semgrep rules to only python rules so that we don't create duplicates found in other analyzers.\n- [x] Ensure feature parity with other analyzers:\n  - [x] Enabled by existing SAST vendored template behind the [SAST_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#experimental-features) env var.\n  - [x] Run at same licensure as other SAST analyzers.\n  - [x] Match existing support for custom rulesets.\n  - [x] Field mappings - severity, location, field descriptions\n  - [x] ultimate licensing limit for requisite features\n    - [x] custom rulesets (dir/path exlusions)\n  - [x] SEARCH_MAX_DEPTH\n  - [x] Logging\n  - [x] Must work offline\n- [x] Investigate SARIF output as a way to generate a report. This could have a great impact on report generation down the line if it isn't too difficult.\n- [x] Create downstream qa tests\n- [x] Document new semgrep analyzer\n\n### Notes\n\nThis may be a good

doesn't affect the latest version of the analyzer (`bundler-audit:2`) but will prevent the publishing of new versions as the build will fail.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. go to bundler audit analyzer project https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit\n2. run pipeline for master https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/-/pipelines/new\n3. observe that downstream ruby projects fail (e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/-/pipelines/245565353)\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/jobs/980683674#L42\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nScanning of ruby projects fails with:\n\n```\nexit

scanner` doesn't pin its logger (`thor`) version: https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit/blob/master/gemspec.yml#L13\n\nThis means that even though both `bundler` and `bundler-audit` scanner are pinned in the analyzer's Dockerfile (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/-/blob/master/Dockerfile#L35), the underlying logging library will still be updated. This causes the scanning error because the `thor` gem went from `1.0.1` to `1.1.0` two days ago.\n\nThe effect of this is as follows:\n- `bundler-audit scanner` sets logging options to quiet (hoping to ensure that the scan only has an exit code without anything written to stdout)\n- in `bundler-audit scanner` with `thor 1.0.1` this `quiet` option was ignored so that even if you set quiet you still got a full output (see [bundler-audit-gem-output.text](/uploads/fb3bde0a10239c14e42c1a0e75e1487d/bundler-audit-scanner.text))\n- `bundler-audit` analyzer uses the scanner's output to decide whether vulnerabilities were found by checking for the line \"Vulnerabilities found!\" (and uses the output to generate the scanning report), but it sets the `--quiet` option on the `bundle audit check` command  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/-/blob/master/analyze.go#L68\n- because the `--quiet` option was ignored in `thor 1.0.1` the analyzer continued to work until `thor 1.1.0` where this bug was fixed (https://github.com/erikhuda/thor/blob/df6663e9070fe254a308642db4f3efdc474d6ca9/lib/thor/shell/basic.rb#L97)\n- because the analyzer relies on the old (incorrect) logging implementation, scanning breaks with the new fix\n\nThe `bundler-audit` `stable` and `major` images are not affected by this because the new version of `thor` was released 2 days ago (2021-01-20) https://github.com/erikhuda/thor/releases and no new analyzer releases have happened since then. However, running the pipeline on the analyzer's master branch breaks because the new `thor` version is used on docker build. This will be confusing for those making changes to the analyzer.\n\nThe fix is to:\n1. remove the `--quiet` flag on the `bundle audit check` command\n1. to check for the presence of vulnerabilities, just check the last line of the output","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-22T19:37:58.586Z","updated_at":"2021-01-26T09:55:00.260Z","closed_at":"2021-01-26T09:40:53.378Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","backend","bug::availability","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::1","section::sec","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"}],"author":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299584","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299584","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299584/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299584/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299584","relative":"#299584","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299584"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77704102,"iid":299582,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve testability of StandardContext","description":"We currently test sending events with `StandardContext` like so:\n```ruby\nexpect_snowplow_event(category: 'epics', action: 'promote', property: 'issue_id', value: issue.id,\n                                  standard_context: kind_of(Gitlab::Tracking::StandardContext))\n```\n\nPerhaps we can build the `standard_context` part of the expectation into the `expect_snowplow_event` helper.

Add `id` to schema that `Formatters::DependencyList` produces.\n3. Add `id` as a part of `DependencyList::Dependency#composite_key`\n4.

SubGroupEntitiesPipeline vs EpicsPipeline). Pipelines that use GraphQL Extractor pass the whole collection through the pipeline, which was working great until we started to need record-by-record processing. \n\nFor example, in order to implement https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297459 we need to pass individual records thought the pipeline, since during transformation phase we check if parent epic exists in database in order to link epic with it's parent. This can't be done when passing the whole collection at once (since no parent is persisted yet). \n\n## Proposed solution \n\n1. Create a new standardised `ExtractedData` response class to wrap response from GraphQL/REST APIs in order to have unified interface \n2. Update `BulkImports::Common::Extractors::GraphqlExtractor` to use newly created response class to return `ExtractedData` object instead of raw hash\n3. Update `BulkImports::Common::Extractors::GraphqlExtractor` and add new `key_path` option to replace `HashKeyDigger`. \n4. Remove `HashKeyDigger` transformer entirely, since there would be no need in it anymore. \n5. Make sure `BulkImports::Pipeline::Runner` yields individual records instead of the whole collection to transformers, so that by the time second record is being processed, first one is persisted.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-22T10:49:59.113Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T18:55:25.561Z","closed_at":"2021-02-02T18:55:25.506Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Next Up","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299527","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299527","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299527/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299527/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299527","relative":"#299527","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299527"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4931,"epic":{"id":145558,"iid":4931,"title":"GitLab Migration - Technical Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4931","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77671789,"iid":299525,"project_id":278964,"title":"Expose epic events in GraphQL API","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nWhen using Group Migration and importing epics, imported data should include events as per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297465.

For example Redis counters go under same redis_hll_couters top level key\n\nThe current usage ping structure and naming convention is vague:\n- there is a loosely defined structure of how to organize/nest counters, making it difficult to know where to put new counters.\n- the naming convention is not standardized across all counters, making it difficult to know what to name new counters.\n\n\n## Nesting structure\nThe goal is to keep this as flat as possible and instead to add details into the naming convention or event dictionary.\n\n- license\n- settings\n- counts_7d\n- counts_28d\n- counts_all\n\n## Naming convention of metrics and events:\n- top_level: count_7d, count_28d, count_all, license, setting\n- segmentation: group, project, user, none\n- event_name: primary name in [event dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VzE8R72Px_Y_LlE3Z05LxUlG_dumWe3vl-HeUo70TPw/edit#gid=618391485)\n\nFor example: \n- `#{top_level}.#{segmentation}_#{event_name}` \n- count_all.projects_prometheus_active\n\n## Event Dictionary:\n\nWe continue to add to the existing event dictionary: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VzE8R72Px_Y_LlE3Z05LxUlG_dumWe3vl-HeUo70TPw/edit#gid=618391485\n\n- product_owner: [section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/sections.yml), [stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/stages.yml), [group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/stages.yml)\n- product_category: [categories.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/categories.yml)\n- implementation: snowplow js, snowplow ruby, redis hll, ordinary batch counter, etc.\n- metric and event name\n- description\n- etc.\n\nFor example:\n \n| metric and event name | product owner | product category | implementation | ... |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| count_all.projects_prometheus_active | ops.monitor | integrations | usage ping batch counting | ... |\n\n## Migration Plan\n\n- Create a v2 Usage Ping file and job that runs in parallel to the existing Usage Ping. Try to combine both CE and EE files together.\n- Create a v2 Versions endpoint to collect Usage Ping.

Our usage of `jq` has become very complex, to the point where we need to start [writing tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215596) to ensure it functions as expected. \n\nIn order to improve the maintainability and flexibility of the [`compare_reports.sh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/master/scripts/compare_reports.sh) shell script, we will eventually be [migrating it to a ruby implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299038).\n\nOnce this migration to ruby has been completed, the next step is to replace our usage of `jq` with a pure ruby implementation, which is the purpose of this issue.\n\n### Further details\n\n[compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/9aee1de0a744e49577d026f66f8164ba07fdef5d/scripts/compare_reports.sh) currently goes through the following steps:\n1. `sanitize_and_diff_reports`\n   1. filter the actual and expected reports **using `jq` filters**; the exact filter depends on the report type \n   1. compare the actual report to the expected report using `diff -u -b`\n   1. report an error and exit 1 if there's a diff\n1. `validate_report_json`\n   1. get the commit ref of `security-report-schemas` based on the version stored in the actual report\n   1. get the filename of the schema based on the type of the actual report\n   1. fetch the JSON schema\n   1. do JSON schema validation using Python\n   1. report an error and exit 65 if validation fails\n\njq filters are used in the first step, when preparing the reports before comparing them.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script will be easier to maintain and follow by other developers, and we can add more test coverage using standard `ruby` tools such as [`rspec`](https://rspec.info)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nwith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299038 we'll get a ruby script that do the same job as [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/1afd341324d4bdaa51d4091b00c64d98508f4739/scripts/compare_reports.sh#L36-45)) \n1.

Write unit tests if found missing test cases\n\n### Further details\n\nSee [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299038#note_487463453) for more details\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nUnit tests will be added for the filtering/sorting/sanitizing component of `compare_reports.rb` ruby script\n\n### Available Tier\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n`jq` from the [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script is replaced by a `ruby` implementation with unit tests.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" ~\"Enterprise Edition\"\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes, this affects all secure projects\n\n### Links / references\n\n- [Migrate compare_reports shell script in ci-templates to ruby](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299038)\n- [Add tests for compare_reports script in ci-templates project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215596)\n\n/cc @gonzoyumo @NicoleSchwartz @fcatteau @theoretick","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-22T01:05:28.050Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:01:10.056Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T08:21:53.943Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Category:DAST","Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:License Compliance","Category:SAST","Category:Secret Detection","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","priority::2","section::sec","test","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299503","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299503","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299503/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299503/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299503","relative":"#299503","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299503"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5823,"epic":{"id":255201,"iid":5823,"title":"Composition Analysis Testing improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5823","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":77647349,"iid":299498,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow groups to be re-imported","description":"## Problem to solve \n\nOnce a group has been imported once, a subsequent (re)load of the group list will show the group as available for import again. This is good, but the user can't tell that a group has already been imported and may, by mistake, perform another import.\n\n![import_my_group](/uploads/87160064fb2c15171608fa6cbcc55558/import_my_group.mov)\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nCreate a first-class experience for re-importing, instead of the current experience where it somehow just works (sometimes). It should be obvious to the user when a group has already been imported at least once. For example, the button might say `Re-import`, instead of `Import`, or there could be a link there to the previous import(s).\n\nIn order to prevent re-importing attempts into an existing group, the default (proposed) group names should be suffixed with a `-1`. For example, re-importing a group named `my-group` would propose `my-group-1` as the target group name. Few notes on the suffix:\n* It is acceptable to keep adding `-1`, instead of following the sequence to avoid following long sequences. This means that `my-group-1-1` would be proposed if `my-group-1` exists.\n* If it is feasible, we could also add a random, humanly-readable suffix, typically used for deconflicting, such as `-color-animal`, i.e. `-blue-horse`, `teal-fish`... - UX would have to chime in on this, as it may need to become a pattern for deconflicting names in other places.\n* This generation of the default group name should run only once, when the page is loaded (preferably async - after the page loads). If the user changes the target (parent) group in the dropdown, the proposed group name should not be automatically re-generated. The validation will highlight the conflict and the user will be able to (will be forced to) deconflict the name before importing. \n\n## MVC\nInteraction notes on image (%\"13.11\")\n\n![13.11_Re-import__1_](/uploads/b83970c67c16394a42d3a874162753da/13.11_Re-import__1_.jpg)\n\n## Additional considerations\n\n* It is acceptable that a \"regular\" user who has permissions to import a group can see the fact that another user performed an import on that same group.\n* Partially successful imports (a situation where a new group was created, but something failed during the import) should also be treated as re-import. \n* However, a failed import after which there is no new group visible (not created, or created and then deleted) should be treated as a first-time import (not re-import).\n* We need to be clear that re-import **does not** mean \"sync\" or \"refresh\" of the new group with the data from the old group. It is simply another one-time, one-way migration of a group that had already been migrated. \n* Importing or re-importing into an existing group is still not possible. Validation will be added in another issue to prevent this. - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300427\n\n## Figma design file\n\n### [:art: Allow groups to be re-imported](https://www.figma.com/file/gziIKXOEP8wUhjBZGXzsXB/299498-Allow-groups-to-be-re-imported?node-id=1%3A27)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-21T22:51:45.762Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T16:10:49.205Z","closed_at":"2021-09-14T03:04:00.229Z","closed_by":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Deliverable","GitLab Free","Importer:GitLab Migration","Next Up","UX","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","frontend","group::import","milestone::p2","missed-deliverable","missed:14.2","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"user_notes_count":37,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299498","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299498","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299498/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299498/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299498","relative":"#299498","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299498"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4613,"epic":{"id":126554,"iid":4613,"title":"GitLab Migration - UX improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4613","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77632708,"iid":299482,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate automatically installing Jira Connect App from GitLab","description":"### Topic to Evaluate\n\nThere are two parts to the GitLab/Jira integration.

This makes it difficult to determine who I'm looking at. They are set to 16px x 16px which appears to be the size within the Pajamas assets, but while I believe this may be a standard size for icons, I don't think it should apply to avatars.
