In the successful scenario, when we update the snippet, a new repository will be created and the info will be committed. Nevertheless, an error is raised.\n\nWhen we update a snippet we perform all the operations inside a db transaction:\n\n```ruby\nsnippet.with_transaction_returning_status do\n  snippet.save.tap do |saved|\n    break false unless saved\n\n    # In order to avoid non migrated snippets scenarios,\n    # if the snippet does not have a repository we created it\n    # We don't need to check if the repository exists\n    # because `create_repository` already handles it\n    if Feature.enabled?(:version_snippets, current_user)\n      create_repository_for(snippet)\n    end\n\n    # If the snippet repository exists we commit always\n    # the changes\n    create_commit(snippet) if snippet.repository_exists?\n  end\nrescue =\u003e e\n````\n\nNevertheless, when we have several shards there is a race condition. When the snippet does not have a repository, we create a `snippet_repository` and create the repository on disk. All this, inside a db transaction (this fact is important).\n\nWhen we commit the operation, we end up in the internal API (in a different thread). This means that, when we query for `snippet.repository_storage` inside the internal API, because `snippet_repository` is not present (because it's only present inside the db transaction in a different thread), we pick a random storage and perform the operation on it. Obviously, this failed. \n\nWe have to perform the creation of the different objects outside the db transaction. That way will have the info in every thread.\n\nBesides this, **there is another problem**. If there was an error, we roll back the `snippet_repository` creation but the repo created in disk wasn't removed.\n\n**An there is one more problem**. We have to roll back the changes in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28516. There are some errors like the `GRPC::Not Found` error that reveals the repository path. Instead, we will show again the generic message.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-04T10:43:31.685Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T14:24:10.234Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T15:48:32.499Z","closed_by":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean

If filtering only matches Epic 1, only return Epic 1\n1. If the filtering only matches Epic 2, only return Epic 2\n1. If the filtering matches Epic 1 *AND* 2, return 1 with 2 nested under it.\n1. If the filtering matches Epic 2 *AND* 3, return 2 with 3 nested under it.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ]  Allow the user to view **all** child epics within an epic, up to the depth of 5 similar

image","description":"\u003c!-- The first three sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\" and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nSince GitLab %\"12.10\", we've release two `cloud-deploy` images: `aws-base` and `aws-ecs`. They are the result of [the split of a single image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210543) made during that milestone.\n\nThis separation triggered a deprecation process for the original image located at `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy`.\n\nThis issue is to track its removal, ending the deprecation process\n\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Proposal\n\nSome TODOs:\n- remove `cloud-deploy` image Dockerfile and related CI file (?)\n- remove deprecation message from the project README file.\n- remove build process for the deprecated image.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\ncc @ogolowinski","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-03T18:52:57.784Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T14:31:34.688Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T14:35:59.431Z","closed_by":{"id":444,"username":"dzaporozhets","name":"Dmytro Zaporozhets (DZ)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/444/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzaporozhets"},"labels":["Alliances - AWS","Category:Continuous Delivery","Release::P3","backstage [DEPRECATED]","cicd::active","deprecation","devops::release","group::release","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"}],"author":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213386","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213386","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213386/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213386/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213386","relative":"#213386","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213386"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32849683,"iid":213382,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve query performance to retrieve Job Artifacts, LFS Objects, and Uploads with files stored locally","description":"#### Summary\n\nThe following discussion from !25461 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @ahegyi started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25461#note_291870358):\n\n    \u003eFixing data doesn't make much sense without adding constraints on the DB side. (unless it's causing application bugs)\n    \u003e\n    \u003eAdding NOT NULL constraints will lock the table while the constraint is checked, which is a big problem for high traffic tables. Currently we don't have a way to do this without negatively affecting gitlab.com's stability.\n    \u003e\n    \u003eI'd propose the following:\n    \u003e\n    \u003e1. Wait until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/22808 is finished.\n    \u003e1. Create indices to support the background migration https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28832\n    \u003e\n    \u003e* We don't have too much data to migrate, so we could do the data migration \"inline\". Or keep the BG migration, since it's the safest approach.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e1. Add `CHECK CONSTRAINT` to the table as `NOT VALID`\n    \u003e\n    \u003e* We need `structure.sql` for this, since rails doesn't support check constraints.\n    \u003e* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/ddl-constraints.html\n    \u003e\n    \u003e1. A separate migration can do a final update of the potential NULL values (count should be close to 0) and validate constraint without locking the table (only schema change lock is required). (next milestone)\n    \u003e\n    \u003eReasoning about the indices:\n    \u003e\n    \u003eUncached timings are not too great. Let's add a specialized index to make the lookup fast:\n    \u003e\n    \u003e```ruby\n    \u003eadd_concurrent_index :ci_job_artifacts, :id, where: 'file_store IS NULL'\n    \u003eadd_concurrent_index :lfs_objects, :id, where: 'file_store IS NULL'\n    \u003eadd_concurrent_index :uploads, :id, where: 'store IS NULL'\n    \u003e```\n\n\n#### TO-DO\n\n1.

In order to find this information today, a user must navigate to their namespace settings \u003e billing to find the end of the trial and an upgrade option.\r\n \r\n\r\n![image](/uploads/b6b912b2ed99d05e3b43a0b43f429414/image.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe previously thought about adding this information to the top right dropdown but decided to not move forward due to the possible user confusion if they have multiple namespaces and/or multiple trials as it could be confusing which namespace the trial status was referencing.  \r\n \r\n## Potential Solution\r\n \r\nIf a namespace is active in a trial we could add the trial status to the left nav. This navigation area is unique to the group so it solves our previous concern. It's also a global area but not overly obtrusive to the user experience. \r\n \r\nI'm thinking to start this trial status would only appear for admins/owners and provide them with a CTA that would take them to their group billing page where they could review plans and select to upgrade when they're ready. \r\n \r\nNote: I found an issue where this was discussed with a prior team but I'm struggling to find the issue at the moment. If I find it, I'll update this issue. \r\n \r\nOpen to ideas on how we could best display this but my high-level thoughts are we could possibly fit either: \r\n* At the top of the left nav under the Group/Project name\r\n* At the bottom of the left navigation items \r\n \r\nI'd love to get your thoughts on this one!\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nFor a cohort of admins/owners, we will display the trial status to within the navigation sidebar. This trial status will be displayed on the project and on the group navigation for 30 days. After 30 days, when trial ends, it will be removed from the UI.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the trial status we will add a [popover](https://design.gitlab.com/components/popover) to display the exact end date of the trial, this popover is accessible via hover at any time but will be displayed on page load when users reach the 14 and 3 days left threshold. This also gives users the ability to subscribe to Gold directly from the popover and compare all plans (via billing page). Proceeding this way will open up multiple follow up experiment where we can test content and timing of the popover and observe the [impact on conversion](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/growth/-/epics/38). \r\n\r\n#### Trial status to subscription flow\r\n![trial-status-to-subscription](/uploads/2953e517f82944b989f42629ba85756a/trial-status-to-subscription.mov)\r\n\r\n#### Popover interaction \u0026 plan comparison\r\n![trial-status-popover](/uploads/af55077b757d1de7beed3a6b731a10b1/trial-status-popover.mov)\r\n\r\n#### Timed prompt\r\n| 14 days left | 3 days left |\r\n| ------ | ------ |\r\n| ![image](/uploads/2cf4a29cd81865e68964ce63a4bf184a/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/796d79ea6105388267fe0ef6925f6374/image.png) |\r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n* [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/AGzUBIW7SwnYY5QGyNoRiU/XP-Trial-status?node-id=69%3A508\u0026viewport=468%2C285%2C0.25\u0026scaling=min-zoom)\r\n* [Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/AGzUBIW7SwnYY5QGyNoRiU/XP-Trial-status?node-id=63%3A0)\r\n* [Design discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213376/designs/Trial_status_1st_steps.jpg)\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-03T17:48:05.040Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T14:07:13.589Z","closed_at":"2020-06-24T14:19:10.326Z","closed_by":{"id":4412383,"username":"kcomoli","name":"Kevin Comoli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4412383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kcomoli"},"labels":["UX","UX Team:  Easy to Trial GitLab Theme","devops::growth","group::acquisition","link::child issue","milestone::p2","missed:13.1","tw::finished","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":4412383,"username":"kcomoli","name":"Kevin Comoli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4412383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kcomoli"}],"author":{"id":4413992,"username":"s_awezec","name":"Sam Awezec","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4413992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/s_awezec"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4412383,"username":"kcomoli","name":"Kevin Comoli","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4412383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kcomoli"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213376","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213376","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213376/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213376/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213376","relative":"#213376","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213376"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3539,"epic":{"id":64885,"iid":3539,"title":"[UX] Display active trial status","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3539","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32844865,"iid":213371,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Docs to disallow mix of local/remote gitalies","description":"\nThis description is taken from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5221, which describes the same issue.\n\nThe way inter-gitaly communication works is that gitaly server metadata is passed through the RPC request context. \n\neg: gitaly-1 needs to talk to gitaly-2 to call `FetchInternalRemote`\n\nlet's say the `git_data_dirs` is the following:\n\n```yaml\ngit_data_dirs({\n  \"gitaly-1\" =\u003e {\n    \"gitaly_address\" =\u003e \"tcp://10.23.223.41:2305\",\n    \"gitaly_token\" =\u003e 'xyzabc'\n  },\n  \"gitaly-2\" =\u003e {\n    \"gitaly_address\" =\u003e \"tcp://10.23.243.98:2305\",\n    \"gitaly_token\" =\u003e 'xyzabc'\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIn this case, `gitaly-2`'s information will be sent through the request context. So that once on `gitaly-1`, it will find that `gitaly-2`'s address is `tcp://10.23.243.98:2305` and dial that address. Everything is good :+1: \n\n\nHowever, let's say we have the following instead:\n\n```yaml\ngit_data_dirs({\n  \"gitaly-1\" =\u003e {\n    \"gitaly_address\" =\u003e \"tcp://10.23.223.41:2305\",\n    \"gitaly_token\" =\u003e 'xyzabc'\n  },\n  \"gitaly-2\" =\u003e {\n    \"path\" =\u003e \"/var/opt/gitlab/git-data\"\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis is a case when we are using a **mix of local and remote gitalies**. This will break inter-gitaly communication, because `gitaly-2`'s address defaults to the unix socket, `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/gitaly.socket`.\n\nSo then `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/gitaly.socket` gets passed to `gitaly-1`, on `gitaly-1` it will dial `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/gitaly.socket`, which then happens on its remote machine. Now we have `gitaly-1` calling its own socket, thinking it's `gitaly-2`. not good!\n\nWe need to update the gitaly and praefect docs to make a note to customers to not do this in their setups.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-03T17:07:20.300Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T07:33:32.215Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T01:01:19.237Z","closed_by":{"id":2683848,"username":"eread","name":"Evan

details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo give user visibility and the opportunity to update, changes need to be introduced in the following phases:\n\n* Phase 1\n  * Milestone %\"13.1\" / %\"13.2\" \n  * Legacy feature flags are deprecated\n  * Allow user to create feature flags in the new system\n    * All new feature flags will be created using the new system\n    * Legacy feature flags cannot be created\n  * Display a warning message in legacy feature flags\n    * Message TBD - This feature flag was created using the legacy system.  On xx this feature flag will become read-only.  Please create a new feature flag.  Link to documentation.\n  * Legacy flags are indicated with an icon with tooltip in the feature flag list\n* Phase 2\n  * Milestone %\"13.4\" \n  * Legacy feature flags become read-only (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220227)\n  * Display a warning message in legacy feature flags\n    * Message TBD - This feature flag was created using the legacy system.  On xx this feature flag will be removed.  Please create a new feature flag.  Link to documentation.\n  * Remove the save button from legacy feature flags.\n  * Legacy flags are indicated with an icon with tooltip in the feature flag list\n* Phase 3\n  * Milestone %\"14.0\" \n  * Legacy feature flags are removed.\n  * Feature flag list only shows feature flags using the new system.\n\nAPI endpoints that will be deprecated:\n\n* All of the Feature Flag Scopes API will be deprecated:  https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/feature_flag_specs.html\n* Parts of the Feature Flags API will be deprecated:  https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/feature_flags.html\n\nAll the CRUD operations related to the existing feature flag `scopes` will be deprecated.  This includes, for instance, the following parameters for the [New feature flag endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/feature_flags.html#new-feature-flag):\n\n* `scopes`\n* `scopes:environment_scope`\n* `scopes:active`\n* `scopes:strategies`\n\nSimilarly, the `scopes` field on [getting a feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/feature_flags.html#single-feature-flag) will be deprecated.\n\nWhen `default_flag`'s association on `Operations::FeatureFlag` model is removed, `rubocop/cop/default_scope.rb` cop should be extended to catch also `foo = User ; foo.default_scope` usages - more details in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33847/diffs#note_357357255\n\n### UX Proposal\n\n| Desc | Mockup |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Phase 1, Phase 2 - Display warning on legacy feature flags | ![image](/uploads/834756e4c8308bd8d280a189e6324bb2/image.png) |\n| Phase 1, Phase 2 - Legacy feature flags |

Documentation\n\n### Testing\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n### What is the type of buyer?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-03T16:39:54.805Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T09:42:30.494Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T17:34:57.953Z","closed_by":{"id":5211906,"username":"csouthard","name":"Chase

Some organizations will also need this artifact for all environments or some combination of staging, production, test, etc.\n\n### Solution\n\n- In the Compliance Dashboard, add a new button for Merge Commits Export\n  - This action should communicate that it will only download the most recent merge commits from the parent group, capped at 15 MB\n  - This should be a streaming download\n\nThe export should provide a CSV of all **merge commits** to the maximum 15MB file size limit.\n\n| Merge Commit | Author | Merge Request | Merged By | Pipeline | Group | Project | Approver(s) |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| SHA | Jeremy | !439858 | Matt | pipeline_id | My-Group | awesome-project | Daffy Duck |\n| SHA | Jeremy | None | Jeremy | pipeline_id | My-Group | awesome-project | None |\n\n|[Open Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/KzEjS76moRngYZepzhnscI/213364-Chain-of-custody-report-list-of-commits?node-id=93%3A52)|\n|---|\n|![Export_list_of_all_merge_commits](/uploads/1ab9df0c7bbb1a0a37c3ea68e48fe087/Export_list_of_all_merge_commits.png)|\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis would be accessible only to `Group Owners` and `Admins`\n\n### Documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* Number of times this report is exported\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

How can we improve the dismiss action in feature discovery moments","description":"## Problem \nCurrently, if a free user interacts with some specific feature discovery moments they have the option to select \"Don't show me this again. If a user selects this option the element is removed forever so the user has essentially deleted a portion of the UI that they can never get back with just one click. This experience is also different throughout the app where some feature discovery moments don't have this option at all while others do.  \n \nExamples:\n \n| Issue weights | Service Desk | Analytics | Issue export |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Issue_Weights_Control](/uploads/ee9227b3572f60f08b47ef63a77d0e82/Issue_Weights_Control.png) | ![Service_Desk](/uploads/eb9d7b6c09d0bd358e9317b3ea675924/Service_Desk.png) | ![Analytics](/uploads/2161da67aae1cd42660b79a0859946ab/Analytics.png) | ![Issue_Export](/uploads/8a596d973f4a5c982b6eb7981edbd230/Issue_Export.png) |\n| Selecting \"don't show me this again\" deletes this portion of the UI forever unless the user upgrades | Selecting the \"X\" deletes this portion of the UI forever unless the user upgrades | User has no option to close/delete this portion of the UI | Selecting the \"X\" closes this window but the export option remains and a user can interact with this upgrade moment again in the future |\n \n## UX Request\n* How can we better support users by providing a consistent user experience when interacting/closing upgrade moments?\n* How can we ensure free users can collapse or close upgrade moments but still give them the option to interact with the upgrade moment again in the future? \n* Do we need to allow customers the ability to hide all upgrade moments via a setting and/or provide the option that they should only appear for admins/owners?\n* Do we need to allow self-managed instances the ability to disable upgrade moments even if the instance is free?\n \n**My personal thoughts**\n* Free users on .com should not be able to hide upgrade moments forever as we're paying the hosting costs for their account and providing them with a free service, upgrade moments are an accepted part of a free user experience\n* If someone is a paying customer, I think it makes sense to give them some control over upgrade moments giving them the ability to have them display for all users or only admins/owners. This would allow customers to turn them off most of the time to reduce noise from users and turn them on when they're looking for feedback on if they should upgrade the instance\n* I don't have a strong opinion on self-managed free upgrade moments.

This is due to the `data-original` attribute allowing html encoded data to be stored, which is then extracted and used as the link content. If the original data already is html encoded then it will be unencoded after it is redacted:\n\n```ruby  \n    def redacted_node_content(node)  \n      original_content = node.attr('data-original')  \n      link_reference = node.attr('data-link-reference')\n\n      # Build the raw \u003ca\u003e tag just with a link as href and content if  \n      # it's originally a link pattern.

The rendered markdown contains the injected html:\n\n    ```html  \n    \u003cdiv class=\"md\"\u003e\u003cp data-sourcepos=\"1:1-1:124\" dir=\"auto\"\u003elink: \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/wbowling/private-project/-/issues/1\"\u003exss \u003cimg onerror=\"alert(1)\" src=\"x\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \n    ```\n\nThe above is blocked by the csp, but that can be bypassed similar to https://hackerone.com/reports/662287#activity-6026826 (requires clicking anywhere on the page, but the link is full screen):\n\n```markdown  \nlink: \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/wbowling/private-project/-/issues/1\" title=\"title\"\u003ecsp   \n\u0026lt;a   \n  data-remote=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;  \n  data-method=\u0026quot;get\u0026quot;  \n  data-type=\u0026quot;script\u0026quot;  \n  href=/wbowling/wiki/raw/master/test.js  \n  class='atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select'  \n\u0026gt;  \n  \u0026lt;img height=10000 width=10000\u0026gt;  \n\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;  \n\u003c/a\u003e  \n```\n\nwhich generates the following html:  \n```html  \n\u003cdiv class=\"md issue-realtime-trigger-pulse\"\u003e\u003cp data-sourcepos=\"1:1-11:4\" dir=\"auto\"\u003elink: \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/wbowling/private-project/-/issues/1\"\u003ecsp  \n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca data-remote=\"true\" data-method=\"get\" data-type=\"script\" href=\"/wbowling/wiki/raw/master/test.js\" class=\"atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select\"\u003e  \n\u003cimg height=\"10000\" width=\"10000\"\u003e  \n\u003c/a\u003e  \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \n```\n\n### Impact  \nAnywhere the `ReferenceRedactor` is run arbitrary html can be injected.

I would like to use this feature, as I use such a security token for 2FA already (on gitlab as well), but these keys have a new key type which is not supported by the gitlab UI for adding ssh keys currently\n\n### Intended users\n\nDevelopers, anyone else pushing/pulling git repositories\n\n### Further details\n\nStoring the ssh private key on a security key is a convenient way of securing your ssh access. It allows the secure use of a single ssh key even when switching between computers, since the private key doesn't have to be copied to every machine, or multiple private keys created for the machines. These security keys are also used for secure phishing-resistant 2FA on gitlab already, so a user could use their token for both 2FA and ssh.\n\nAn example of such a public key:\n```\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com AAAAInNrLWVjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTZAb3BlbnNzaC5jb20AAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBHYsEOLfc3STGIU5I3vi8xIDewxg72BnkHozNfXxc+2CL1e9Mkr3Kn8jMS+ZxF2q5kY8oT6x3G+omFZPc51aszcAAAAEc3NoOg== comment\n```\nThe current UI doesn't consider this a proper ssh public key.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis feature is supported since openssh 8.2. Implementation might need an update of the openssh server software, and changes to the ssh key handling.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nAdd e2e test for git operations with FIDO2-based ssh keys: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/2445\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

Have 2 nodes\n2. Edit Primary and uncheck primary box and save (now 2 secondaries with 0 primaries)\n3.

all Dependency Scanning reports","description":"\n### Summary\n\nThe dependency list doesn't show all found vulnerabilities. If some analyzer (e.g. Gemnasium) reports dependencies, and some other analyzer (e.g. Retire.JS) report vulnerabilities for these, those vulnerabilities will be visible on the Project Security Dashboard, but not on the Dependency List page.\n\nThis happens because of how we process reports for the Dependency List page. We are doing it [each by each](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/999ba82df898e6e79ef42785fee1e30a7da11b5e/ee/app/models/ee/ci/build.rb#L88). Our primal source of dependencies is `dependency_files` section of Dependency Scanning report. However, only Gemnasium analyzer is capable of producing this section. And since we're looping through `dependency_files` and [applying found vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/999ba82df898e6e79ef42785fee1e30a7da11b5e/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/dependency_list.rb#L19) in this particular artifact, only all vulnerabilities found by Gemnasium are added to the Dependency List payload.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open a project that contains JavaScript packages\n2. Run `dependency_scanning` job on `master` branch\n3. Observe logs of this job and make sure that there are vulnerabilities reported by not Gemnasium analyzer. (for example, Retire.JS)\n4. Go to Security Dashboard, check a number of Dependency Scanning reported vulnerabilities.\n5. Go to the Dependency List page.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-yarn/-/dependencies\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nVulnerabilities reported by Retire.JS ain't visible from the Dependency list\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nVulnerabilities reported by Retire.JS should be visible from the Dependency list\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWe can change the way how we [collect vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/999ba82df898e6e79ef42785fee1e30a7da11b5e/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/formatters/dependency_list.rb) for Dependency List and [add a dependency](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/999ba82df898e6e79ef42785fee1e30a7da11b5e/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/dependency_list/report.rb#L15) to the report.\n\nWe should loop through the `vulnerabilities` section of the report as well, and add or update the dependency in the report. This also solves an issue with possible duplicates in the list of dependencies.\n\n```ruby\nclass Gitlab::Ci::Parsers::Security::DependencyList\n\n  def parse!(json_data, report)\n  \n    json_data['vulnerabilities'].each do |vulnerability|\n      dependency = extract_dependency_from_location(vulnerability['location'])\n      found_dependency = report.first_or_add(formatted(dependency))\n      found_dependency.add_vulnerability(formatted(vulnerability))\n    end\n\n    json_data['dependency_files'].each do |file|\n

This project gets exported and imported at a new destination\n5. Since the Ghost User is not a member of mentioned project, when project is imported, all occurrences of Ghost User user_id get replaced with importer user id.

This results in the project relation failing to be created (merge request in this case. but this can be anything that has award emojis association)\n\nDuplicated award emojis should either be allowed or filtered out.

analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) tries to install gemnasium-maven-plugin and other resources when running. these install flag are not configurable via environment variables\n\n### Proposal\n\nbundle all necessary requirements within the [gemnasium-maven analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) docker image or provide a way for users to download it and make it available to the analyzer.\n\n\n### Implementation Plan\n- [x] add `maven` plugins at build time to allow a minimal `mvn install`\n- [x] add `gemnasium-maven-plugin` at build time\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nIf this requires user setup, then we must update user documentation.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nTest solution on the airgap-test instance: https://gitlab-airgap-test.us-west1-b.c.group-secure-a89fe7.internal/tests/maven-with-local-registry \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nMaven projects can be successfully scanned in an offline environment.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

When applied, they immediately start to use the license, even before the start date.\n\n### Proposal\nCurrently, when the user uploads the renewal license, the instance accepts this license as the \"current\" license and moves the existing license to history. The logic behind the scenes for this is quite simple; just take the last license uploaded as the \"current\". The new desired behavior is to move the renewal/future-dated license to history (IOW don't consider it the \"current\" license) until the day it is within the licensed date range.\n\nThe simplest way to handle this would be to adjust the [query/logic that pulls the \"current\" license](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8d63638f5ecb2a385e2add4f681dd2c890ff3c03/ee/app/models/license.rb#L271). Instead of using the most recent license, find the most recently uploaded license where the current date is within the licensed date range.\n\nAs part of this change, we should also update the License History table to show all licenses, with some distinctions between any future licenses and the current license. A simple background color change might be sufficient.  The table currently shows all licenses from the DB minus the most recently uploaded license.  We will also likely need to update some messaging around license creation.  It currently states that an uploaded license is active, but that won't always be the case now.  There may be other small changes like this that are necessary as well.\n\nIt will also be important to test that true-up and user validations don't block the future-dated license from being applied.  See [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212597#note_315053817) for more information.\n\n### Result\nPrevent the use of future-dated licenses in self-managed instances.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\nImprove the UX for the License History table to allow for deleting of specific licenses.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-01T14:29:00.537Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T00:52:09.000Z","closed_at":"2020-05-19T08:47:38.142Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"labels":["Deliverable","Engineering","EntApp Ecosystem","GTMPriority::Feature","Internal Compliance","backend","devops::fulfillment","frontend","group::purchase","link::child issue","missed-deliverable","priority::1","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":4430316,"username":"rhardarson","name":"Ragnar Hardarson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4430316/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rhardarson"},{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4430316,"username":"rhardarson","name":"Ragnar Hardarson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4430316/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rhardarson"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213108","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213108","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213108/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213108/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213108","relative":"#213108","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213108"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32735392,"iid":213102,"project_id":278964,"title":"Resolution summary is not used when creating issue from vulnerability","description":"### Summary\n\n1.

This means that if the Container Scanning job fails, the pipeline will continue executing.  If a customer prefers to alter this behaviour and have the pipeline fail in the event that vulnerabilities have been found, they'll need to override the Container Scanning template as follows:\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n  template: Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\ncontainer_scanning:\n  allow_failure: false\n  script:\n    - apk add jq\n    - /analyzer run\n    - [ `jq '.vulnerabilities | length' gl-container-scanning-report.json` -eq 0 ]\n```\n\nThis approach is fragile because it exposes internals of the Container Scanning tool, as well as couples the implementation to the Operating System of the Docker image, and also provides unnecessary friction for changing this behaviour. \n\nIn order to provide increased flexibility we should add a new environment variable to Container Scanning to allow them to easily customize the exit code of a Container Scanning job.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### Further details\n\nAdd a new `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` environment variable to container scanning which will represent the number of vulnerabilities that are allowed to occur before the Container Scanning tool returns a `1` exit code.\n\nThe `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` environment variable will have the following behaviour:\n\n1. If `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` has not been set, it will default to `0` which means that Container Scanning will not return a non-zero exit code when vulnerabilities have been found\n1. If `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` has been set to a value \u003e 0, then Container Scanning will return a `1` exit code if the number of vulnerabilities encountered surpasses this value.  For example, if the `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` has been set to `5`, then a `1` exit code will be returned as soon as `6` vulnerabilities have been discovered.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\n1. [ ] Update [environment.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/master/environment/environment.go#L77) in the `GitLab Container Scanning` project to remove the hardcoded `envVarVulnerabilityThreshold` and allow this option to be configured. This value will be passed onto the [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar) binary as `CLAIR_THRESHOLD`.\n1. [ ] Update the [Available Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#available-variables) section of the Container Scanning documentation to include the new `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` variable\n1. [ ] Add a new `Configuring allow_failure` section to the [Container Scanning documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning), explaining how to `allow_failure` functions by default and how to override the behaviour by setting the `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` to cause a pipeline to halt if vulnerabilities have been found.\n1. [ ] Add a test to the [Container Scanning test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/container-scanning) to show that this new `CS_VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD` variable functions as expected\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"Enterprise Edition\"\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-01T09:59:38.417Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T15:56:40.404Z","closed_at":"2022-12-12T15:56:40.116Z","closed_by":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","customer","devops::secure","direction","feature::addition","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::feature","won't do"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We can inspire how confidentiality filtering is done in [IssuesFinder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/12-9-stable-ee/app/finders/issues_finder.rb#L46-51), but the problem is that for groups we don't keep any pre-generated group_authorization which would keep minimum access level for each user for each project. An option how to deal with lack of `group_authorization` table might be:\n  * after getting groups [user can read epics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/12-9-stable-ee/ee/app/finders/epics_finder.rb#L93) we would prepare sub-list of these groups containing only groups where user is a member and his role is reporter or higher (my hope is that because the list of these groups is usually fairly small, also this filtering should be also acceptable)\n  * then the query to filter out confidential epics might be something like (not tested, pseudo code):\n```\nEpic.where(group: \u003coriginal_list_of_groups\u003e).where(epics.confidential IS NOT TRUE or (epics.confidential = TRUE and \n(epic.author_id = :user_id OR EXISTS (select 1 from \u003clist of groups user is at least reporter member\u003e where group_id=epics.group_id))\n```\n\nThis confidential check in EpicsFinder should be done only if `confidential_epics` flag is enabled.\n\n### Update\n\nrelated to this [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29190#note_325552727), even when the feature flag is disabled, it will be better to respect the confidentiality of an epic and not expose these to not-member users. So we may consider something like this to keep confidential epics not-visible to unauthorized users even if the flag is off:\n\n```\nif flag is on:\n  use a new, potentially risky, query\nelsif user is member of the group\n  use existing query which lists all epics\nelse\n  use existing query but filter out confidential epics\nend\n```\n\nOr if not possible we would have to just treat them as public as planned originally.\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197339","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-01T08:37:21.587Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:54:12.969Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T06:47:36.582Z","closed_by":{"id":3717078,"username":"cablett","name":"charlie ablett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3717078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cablett"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Dogfooding","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::plan","epics","group::product planning","missed:12.10","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213075","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213075","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213075/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213075/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213075","relative":"#213075","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213075"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3003,"epic":{"id":38085,"iid":3003,"title":"New Epics can be created as Confidential MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3003","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32716153,"iid":213072,"project_id":278964,"title":"Vulnerability confirm endpoint does not have the confirmed_at and confirmed_by_id properties","description":"\u003c!---\r\nPlease read this!\r\n\r\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\r\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\r\n\r\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\r\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\r\n\r\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\r\n---\u003e\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nWhen hitting the endpoint `/vulnerabilities/:id/confirm`, the vulnerability state is changed to confirmed and the vulnerability object is returned.

The user does not get an error and the Release is rendered identically as it is on the main **Releases** page, or\n1. The Release title is not rendered as a link on the main **Releases** page, so the user can not access the dedicated Release page.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n### Root cause\n\nThis is actually a much larger issue, because:\n\n1. Releases are inextricably tied to Git tags; the tag name is used as the primary identifier for routing purposes\n1. Guest users are not allowed to access any Git-related information in private projects, including tags\n\nFor example, the URL to the dedicated Release page looks like `https://example.gitlab.com/user/project/-/releases/tag`. However, Guest users don't have access to tags, so they cannot access this URL.\n\nIn fact, this is a small security issue: as shown in the screenshot above, we are leaking the tag name `test` through the breadcrumb to a user with Guest permission.\n\nThis also has implications for features like [\"search by Release\"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/#filtering-issue-and-merge-request-lists) and the milestone [\"issue summary\"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html#releases-associated-with-milestones), all of which rely on URLs that include Git tag names.\n\n### Solutions\n\n#### 0. Allow guest users to know tag names associated with releases\n\nFrom [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213016#note_346621554).\nCurrently, we have:\n\n```ruby\n      expose :name do |release, _|\n        can_download_code? ? release.name : \"Release-#{release.id}\"\n      end\n      expose :tag, as: :tag_name, if: -\u003e(_, _) { can_download_code? }\n```\n\nin the API, and\n\n```ruby\n      get ':id/releases/:tag_name', requirements: RELEASE_ENDPOINT_REQUIREMENTS do\n        authorize_download_code!\n```\n\non the dedicated release page api.\n\nIf we just remove these conditions, we can allow users to visit the dedicated release pages without some of the content. Users still won't be able to:\n\n* download code\n* see commit hash\n* download evidence\n\nThere are a few ways we can address this bug (and all other related issues):\n\n#### 1. Make tag information available to Guest users\n\nThis would be the simplest solution, since it would allow Releases to behave more-or-less identically for Guest users as they do for Developers, Maintainers, etc.\n\nHowever, this _probably_ isn't an option, as this would be a change in security policy. But it might be worth investigating.\n\n#### 2. Always reference Releases by ID, not tag name\n\nIf we used the Release ID as its primary identifier instead of its tag name, this issue would go away.  For example, a Release with a URL like `https://example.gitlab.com/user/project/-/releases/v1.2` would instead be accessed with a URL like `https://example.gitlab.com/user/project/-/releases/2345`.\n\nThis isn't as convenient or as nice to look at, but it would allow Guest users to interact with Releases without exposing the Release's associated tag.\n\nA change like this has the potential to involve a lot of development work.\n\n#### 3. Always reference Releases by some other unique identifier\n\nExactly the same as number \u003cspan\u003e#\u003c/span\u003e2 above, except using a unique identifier other than the Rails ID. For example, we could add a first-class \"version\" concept and use this version as a primary identifier: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213838\n\n#### 4. Lock down Releases for Guest users\n\nA third option is to simply remove any feature that references tag names for Guest users. While this probably makes the most sense, it's unfortunate because almost _all_ features use tag names in some way, so the experience for Guest users will be very crippled. For example, Guest users:\n\n1. won't be able to search issues or merge requests by Release\n1. won't be able to click on issue or merge request counts in the \"issue summary\" section of Release blocks\n1. won't have access to the \"dedicated\" Release page\n   - For example, if a Developer sends a link to a \"dedicated\" Release page to a Guest, they will get a \"404 - Page not found\" error, which isn't intuitive since the Guest has access to the Release on the main **Releases** page","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-31T18:09:06.128Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T14:17:39.786Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T15:44:26.412Z","closed_by":{"id":5622641,"username":"nicolewilliams","name":"Nicole Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5622641/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolewilliams"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","cicd::active","devops::release","frontend","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

`fetchGroupEpics` exported as Vuex action but doesn't follow API","description":"## Context\n\nThe following discussion from !28125 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @pslaughter started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28125#note_314746159): \n\n    \u003e **issue (non-blocking):** I realize this is preexisting, but it's a bit of an issue that we're exporting an action which doesn't accept the right parameters of a Vuex action. Every Vuex action must accept a Vuex context as the first parameter (an object that contains things like `state`, `dispatch`, `commit`, etc.). Here we are expecting to be passed just the state object itself...\n    \u003e \n    \u003e This means that it's possible for a client to call `dispatch('fetchGroupEpics')` and it will blow up.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e We should either:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1. Move this to it's own `service` module (or something like that)\n    \u003e 1. Don't export this as an action.\n    \u003e 1.
