Show record count for the stage (FE)","description":"This is the ~frontend implementation issue.  The ~backend implementation issue is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324687.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently VSA displays a maximum of 20 records when a stage is selected.  It does not display the total count anywhere.  So if there are more than 20 records the total count is unknown.  Even if there are fewer than 20 records in the stage, a user must count them manually to determine the total.\n\n### Proposal\n\nVSA should display the record count for the stage. Probably using the [1001 approach](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300235#note_527936785).\n\nLet's add the count information to the following places:\n\n| table header | stage popover |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Add a badge with count in table header next to the `Issue` header | Add the count information to the stage popover that is displayed when users hover over a stage |\n| ![stage_items_table](/uploads/270593b7de56e6d4fb3c44eef449b564/stage_items_table.png) | ![stage_popover](/uploads/ef1f593d88b3906d51f93cdf2cd37abf/stage_popover.png) |\n\n**Note:** We should fetch count data asynchronously and start fetching data for all stages once the page has loaded. If necessary we should use loading indicators during load time.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-12T22:30:46.690Z","updated_at":"2021-08-10T22:18:19.021Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T05:28:18.623Z","closed_by":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","devops::manage","feature::addition","frontend","group::optimize","priority::3","release post item","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321448","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321448","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321448/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321448/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#321448","relative":"#321448","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#321448"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79003322,"iid":321443,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rename Static Site Editor component to avoid confusion","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nWe want to avoid conflicts between the new Rich Text Editor and the existing WYSIWYG editor used by the Static Site Editor\n\n## Proposal\n\nMove the WYSIWYG Editor used by the Static Site Editor to the `static_site_editor` directory to avoid the confusion of having two generic editor components in the application. \n\nTranslated to fully qualified paths this means:\n\n```git mv app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/rich_content_editor app/assets/javascript/static_site_editor/rich_content_editor```\n\n\n### Implementation guide\n\n- [x] Move `rich_content_editor` component from the `vue_shared/components` directory to the `static_site_editor` directory.

That application is directly linked to GitLab.com, which means self-managed customers need to use other means to get this feature working. [This issue's parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5399) outlines the other options.\n\n## Proposal\n\n@Andysoiron has [proposed an alternative method](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5399#note_507958228) where we could extend the Connect Application functionality on GitLab.com, which will allow it to act as a proxy for self-managed instances.\n\n\u003e Most of what the app does is GitLab pushing data to Jira. This part will work fine on self-managed. Only the setup (installation and loading the iframe for namespace linking) is Jira connecting to GitLab. For this part, we can build a proxy application that handles installation hooks, and redirects users to self-managed instances for namespace linking.\n\nThis will provide the most intuitive solution, allowing all GitLab users to follow the same installation path, regardless of whether they're on SaaS or self-managed.\n\nThe only limitation in this approach is for customers who do not wish their data to be proxied, or have specific network/security limitations that prevent this from being possible. For these customers, they're able to take one of the other approaches that are being documented.\n\n## Solution Breakdown\n\nI did an experimental MR as a proof of concept: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54378\n\n### UX \n\nThere should be a way users can enter the URL to a self-managed instance that should be used for the app. Maybe this can be an extra step in the app setup?\n\nHere is an example:\n![Screenshot_2021-03-10_at_16.56.29](/uploads/64d0881a842071e55df2e2f1d47bbf97/Screenshot_2021-03-10_at_16.56.29.png)\n\n### Frontend\n\nWe can't redirect the iframe on Jira to the instance because changing the location is blocked, so we will have to render a nested iframe and figure out how to receive the `token` from the parent iframe. @tomquirk already had an idea how this could work (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54378#note_512524846)\n\n### Backend\n\n#### Add a new column to jira_connect_installations\n\nIn order to use gitlab.com as a proxy for self-managed instances, we need to know the instance URL. Therefor we need a new column `instance_url` on jira_connect_installations.\n\n#### Add a new controller to update JiraConnectInstallation\n\nAn installation is created when we [receive an event webhook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.9.1-ee/app/controllers/jira_connect/events_controller.rb#L9) from atlassian. A new controller is needed to add an instance URL to an installation.\n\n### Forward events\n\nOnce an installation is updated with a `instance_url` we will send a `installed` event webhook to the instance to pretend that the app was installed on Jira. Whenever we receive events for installations that have a `instance_url` we need to forward them to the instance.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-12T14:46:48.400Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:50:27.622Z","closed_at":"2021-03-18T12:54:36.059Z","closed_by":{"id":4058309,"username":"mnohr","name":"Matt Nohr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f2b70c7a75fd0a15ef789d4b1e620449?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mnohr"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Deliverable","Integration::Jira","Jira::ConnectApp","backend","devops::manage","group::ecosystem [DEPRECATED]","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"}],"author":{"id":3646819,"username":"deuley","name":"Patrick Deuley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3646819/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/deuley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321401","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321401","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321401/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321401/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#321401","relative":"#321401","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#321401"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5399,"epic":{"id":203447,"iid":5399,"title":"GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app should support GitLab self-managed instances","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5399","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78978455,"iid":321398,"project_id":278964,"title":"Implement and Expose EpicList collapsed state in GraphQL","description":"Collapsed state should be stored on the `boards_epic_user_preferences` table.

whenever the record is updated.\n\nWe don't seem to do much caching in this way right now, instead we use explicit key expiry where we delete the values against known keys.\n\nThis issue is to verify the current state of `cache_key` for `Project` and `Repository` models. The `Repository` one, as it isn't an ActiveRecord model, most likely doesn't exist, but we should then be looking to generate it based on the project ID and, most likely, the last push time. This will allow us to reliably cache views based around the repository, such as diffs, that expire automatically when the repository is updated.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-12T11:21:29.781Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T12:57:42.768Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T12:57:42.668Z","closed_by":{"id":2167502,"username":"robotmay_gitlab","name":"Robert

The GitLab package registry needs to have at least the package name and version to make it available for pulling.\n\nTo achieve that, once a nuget package is uploaded, we enqueue a background job (called `Packages::Nuget::ExtractionWorker`) that will pull the package file, open the zip archive and read the `*.nuspec` file to extract among other things, the package name and version.\n\nThe background job will then either:\n\n* find an existing package with that name and version and append the package file\n* update the package with the final name and version\n\nBoth of these operations will make the package file be moved in object storage. This is due to how the path of a package file is computed: we use the package `id`, the package file `id` and the filename of the archive. Updating one of those will require a move within object storage.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Download the file for the metadata extraction. That's the current `#use_open_file` usage. We will still need this.\n* Update the metadata but don't download the file twice. Instead copy it over its new key.\n* Destroy the old key.\n\n### Further details\n\n#### :bar_chart: MR plan\n\nThose changes are quite deep and change how the background job process nuget packages. Given the depth of this change, we will need to use a ~\"feature flag\" as an additional safety net.\n\nThe changes can be in a single MR.\n\n#### :telescope: Things to consider\n\nDuring the MR implementation, we will need to test different conditions to make sure that this change works as expected:\n| Object storage | Existing nuget package |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| disabled | yes |\n| disabled | no |\n| GCP | yes |\n| GCP | no |\n| AWS | yes |\n| AWS | no |\n\nIn particular, we saw that if the nuget package already exists, the DELETE request fails and the original file is left behind. We will need to fix that.\n\nLastly, this need of moving a file within object storage is a common need in package background processing. To make it re-usable, it's advised to create a service specifically for that.\n\n\n#### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/immersaview/public/packages/chromium-embedded-framework/-/jobs/1025547697\n\n- Snippet of log\n```shell\npushd NuGet\n/builds/immersaview/public/packages/chromium-embedded-framework/NuGet /builds/immersaview/public/packages/chromium-embedded-framework\n$ dotnet nuget add source \"$CI_SERVER_URL/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/packages/nuget/index.json\" --name gitlab --username gitlab-ci-token --password $CI_JOB_TOKEN --store-password-in-clear-text\nPackage source with Name: gitlab added successfully.\n$ dotnet nuget push *.nupkg --source gitlab\nwarn : No API Key was provided and no API Key could be found for 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24280473/packages/nuget'.

It was soon [reported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246802#note_506067774) to be similar to an existing pipeline predefined variable `CI_CONFIG_PATH`.\n\nThe purpose of introducing `CI_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` was to be able to use it in evaluating group level pipeline configuration.\n\nSince group level pipeline configurations are included, and only project variables are currently supported (and available) at the time of `include` section evaluation - the variable `CI_CONFIG_PATH` will not be available for consumption.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Convert `CI_CONFIG_PATH` as a predefined project variable.\n- Remove `CI_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` variable (check if deprecation is required - the variable was introduced in 13.8)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-11T22:30:43.833Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T18:13:51.910Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T17:03:46.228Z","closed_by":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","GitLab Core","backend","devops::manage","group::compliance","missed:13.9","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"}],"author":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321334","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321334","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321334/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/321334/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#321334","relative":"#321334","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#321334"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3156,"epic":{"id":45158,"iid":3156,"title":"Allow group owners to define compliance pipeline configurations at the group level","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3156","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78939818,"iid":321329,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update backend calls to Gitlab::Tracking.event to provide project, user, and namespace","description":"Now that `Gitlab::Tracking.event` accepts `project`, `user`, and `namespace` (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52026), we can update calls to provide this information.

Testing was done using our standard performance testing setup in lab conditions with [GPT](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance) running against a [10k Reference Architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/10k_users.html) at 200 RPS.\n\nIt should also be noted that for testing the Project's endpoint we have 2500 projects in our test environment and we test a mix of both forms of pagination (keyset and offset). Additionally this endpoint is [known problem endpoint and has a general performance issue raised against it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211495).\n\nAs shown above the endpoint today pushes each of the 3 GitLab Rails nodes to use around 13.5 GB of ram each where as back on `13.5.0` it only consumed around around 12 GB each. This is a notable increase of around 1.5 GB of Rails ram usage. As such, we thought it worth raising an issue to be investigated why this is the case. This is all the data we have to hand at the moment but access can be granted to our test environments to investigate further as required.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-11T15:42:18.665Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T15:08:20.152Z","closed_at":"2023-01-09T15:02:52.489Z","closed_by":{"id":3769272,"username":"grantyoung","name":"Grant Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3769272/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/grantyoung"},"labels":["Category:Application Performance","Deliverable","Quality:performance-issues","api","backend","bug::performance","devops::manage","group::organization","milestone::p1","missed-deliverable","missed:14.2","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","missed:14.5","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","missed:15.7","organization-error-budget","performance-refinement","priority::2","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

For example, using `job:rules` or `workflow:rules`\n- Absence of a pipeline fails the condition that \"pipeline must succeed\" to allow merge according to the project settings\n\n### Proposal \n\n_**NOTE**: This proposal depends on a new `preparing` state to be added to `MergeRequest#merge_status` state machine in issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54900._\n\n* Introduce a project setting `require_pipeline_presence` (default `true`)\n* Allow the project setting to be changed via API\n* We might need to ensure that a MR is in `preparing` state any time a merge request pipeline is being created.\n* Change `MergeRequest#mergeable_ci_state?` to take in consideration the project setting.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/models/merge_request.rb b/app/models/merge_request.rb\nindex 5fad876d3fb..005940d0894 100644\n--- a/app/models/merge_request.rb\n+++ b/app/models/merge_request.rb\n@@ -1296,7 +1296,9 @@ def can_be_merged_via_command_line_by?(user)\n   end\n \n   def mergeable_ci_state?\n+    return false if preparing?\n     return true unless project.only_allow_merge_if_pipeline_succeeds?\n+    return true unless project.require_pipeline_presence?\n     return false unless actual_head_pipeline\n     return true if project.allow_merge_on_skipped_pipeline? \u0026\u0026 actual_head_pipeline.skipped?\n```\n\nThe UI components will be completed in issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300471.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nPermissions required to perform the described: \n- Project Owner\n- Project Maintainer\n\n### Documentation\n\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\n- Remove the `:inherited_issuable_templates` feature flag\n- Add changelog: `Configure issue and merge request description templates at group level and\n  rolldown description templates in the group hierarchy`\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::project management\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#s_plan`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @acroitor \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nIssues and merge requests templates picker dropdown would show templates from templates project configured at group level, if configured.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n- templates picker would show no templates, or depending on the issue edit or show issue page may not load.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n- General error spikes on Gitlab.com \n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n- ...\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-11T12:42:29.405Z","updated_at":"2021-05-31T10:02:20.472Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T10:02:20.439Z","closed_by":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"labels":["backend","devops::plan","feature flag","group::project management","missed:13.10","section::dev","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It works as expected when done via _SSH/HTTPS_.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Disable the repository feature of the project which has the wiki to be cloned.\n1. Run the following in CI: `git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}@gitlab.com/fullpath/wikiproject.wiki.git`\n\n### Example Project\n\n- [Project with Wiki](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/193173-test)\n- [Project trying to clone wiki](https://gitlab.com/ndesilva/193173-test)\n- [Job failing with Repo turned off](https://gitlab.com/ndesilva/193173-test/-/jobs/1022952462)\n- [Job successful with Repo turned on](https://gitlab.com/ndesilva/193173-test/-/jobs/1022954384)\n- [Job success with Repo turned off via HTTPS](https://gitlab.com/ndesilva/193173-test/-/jobs/1023113269)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUser is shown an error saying \n\u003e remote: You are not allowed to download files from this wiki.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe user should be able to successfully clone the wiki.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```\n$ git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}@gitlab.com/fullpath/193173-test.wiki.git\nCloning into '193173-test.wiki'...\nremote: You are not allowed to download files from this wiki.\nfatal: unable to access 'https://gitlab-ci-token:[MASKED]@gitlab.com/fullpath/193173-test.wiki.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403\nCleaning up file based variables\n00:00\nERROR: Job failed: exit code 1\n```\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe problem seems to be in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/git_access.rb#L110. There, we check the access level value of the repository feature when the user is using a deploy token. But this is wrong in the context of wikis because we should be checking `wiki_access_level`.\n\nBut there is another problem. When the wiki is a group wiki, that line of code would also fail, which means that no group wiki can be cloned using a deploy token.\n\nThe fix would be something like:\n\n```text\n# lib/gitlab/git_access.rb\ndef deploy_key_can_download_code?\n  authentication_abilities.include?(:download_code) \u0026\u0026\n    deploy_key? \u0026\u0026\n    deploy_key.has_access_to?(container) \u0026\u0026\n    right_feature_access_level?\nend\ndef right_feature_access_level?\n  project? \u0026\u0026 project\u0026.repository_access_level != ::Featurable::DISABLED\nend\n\n# lib/gitlab/git_access_wiki.rb\noverride right_feature_access_level?\ndef right_feature_access_level?\n project? \u0026\u0026 project\u0026.wiki_access_level != ::Featurable::DISABLED\nend\n\n# ee/lib/ee/gitlab/git_access_wiki.rb\noverride right_feature_access_level?\ndef right_feature_access_level?\n return super unless container.is_a?(GroupWiki)\n \n # There is no access_level feature yet for group wikis\n # but, if we don't override this here, users won't be able to clone\n # group wikis using deploy tokens\n #\n # Once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208412 is \n # implemented we can add the access_level to this checking.\n

This one will now contain references to both `v1.0.0` and `v1.1.0` of the `second-module`, while only `v1.1.0` is actually used.\n\nThis will lead to false-positives in the dependency scanning.\n\n### Example Project\n\ntbd\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFalse positives in the go dependency scanning, as old unused imports are scanned as well.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnly actually used modules are scanned and will show up in the scan results\n\n\n### Proposed fix\n\n#### Utilize `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages`\n\n| :thumbsup: Benefits | :thumbsdown: Drawbacks |\n| --- | --- |\n| Outputs the modules required by the main module (the module of the repository scanned). | Requires the Go toolchain to be installed.

The packaged version of this is around `100M`. |\n| Can report or filter out test dependencies. | Requires a goproxy to be setup for offline module downloads, vendored dependencies, or a modcache with all dependencies preloaded. |\n\n**MR**: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/203+\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n#### Go versions\n\nThe implementation must take into account the [module's Go version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95464#note_1066400960) when selecting dependencies. For example, if the module mentions `1.17` building with `1.18` might result in a different set of dependencies selected. By default, the version inside of the main module's `go.mod` file is used. For this iteration, matrix testing should be considered out of scope.\n\n#### Vendored dependencies\n\nVendored dependencies can be used to lock in the dependencies that are utilized. Referencing the Go mod [`go directive` documentation](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-go), it states that the `vendor/modules.txt` file records what modules are used. The format for this looks like the following example.\n\n```\n       │ File: vendor/modules.txt\n───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1   │ # github.com/BurntSushi/toml v0.3.1\n   2   │ github.com/BurntSushi/toml\n   3   │ # github.com/Microsoft/go-winio v0.5.1\n   4   │ github.com/Microsoft/go-winio\n```\n\nEvery line for a module that it depends on is commented and implementing a parser for this may be possible. However, it should be noted that it is possible for this to produce **false negatives**. See [Build tags, operating systems, and architectures](#build-tags-operating-systems-and-architectures) for an example of this.\n\n#### Offline environments\n\n[Offline environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/offline_deployments/#defining-offline-environments) are currently supported by the `go.sum` parser since it does not require any network configuration. On the other hand, the `go list` command and the  `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages` module both require the `modcache` to contain the required modules _or_ a Go project that has been vendored. To prevent a breaking change, we can run `go-modlist` first and fallback to `go.sum` parsing if needed. If running the `go.sum` parser, the possibility of false positives should be explicitly logged and include a link to this issue. Running `go-modlist` first offers compatibility for offline environments that have configured the `GOPROXY` variable to point to an internal mirror and repositories that contain vendored dependencies.\n\n#### Build tags, operating systems and architectures\n\nTesting the `gemnasium` project with the `go list -deps -json -f` solution and `go-modlist` produces a total of 41 modules. Interestingly enough, vendoring then parsing `vendor/modules.txt` produces _43_! Diffing the module outputs and then running `go mod why -m` on the diffed modules shows that they are used by the main module.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eOutput\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/modules.txt b/modules_2.txt\nindex 9170913..69df6ad 100644\n--- a/modules.txt\n+++ b/modules_2.txt\n@@ -1,5 +1,7 @@\n github.com/BurntSushi/toml\n+github.com/Microsoft/go-winio\n github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto\n+github.com/acomagu/bufpipe\n github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar\n github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man/v2\n github.com/davecgh/go-spew\n```\n\n```shell\n$ go mod why -m -vendor github.com/acomagu/bufpipe\n# github.com/acomagu/bufpipe\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/v2/advisory\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/v3\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/ruleset\ngithub.com/go-git/go-git/v5\ngithub.com/go-git/go-git/v5/utils/ioutil\ngithub.com/acomagu/bufpipe\n\n$ go mod why -m -vendor github.com/Microsoft/go-winio\n# github.com/Microsoft/go-winio\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/v2/advisory\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/v3\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/ruleset\ngithub.com/go-git/go-git/v5\ngithub.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/client\ngithub.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/ssh\ngithub.com/xanzy/ssh-agent\ngithub.com/Microsoft/go-winio\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nThis indicates that either `go list` and `go-modlist` are both not accurate _or_ that the vendor directory contains more packages due to it's compatibility with different environments. Investigating the build tags for the files that contains these imports shows that this is correct! The [github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/utils/ioutil/pipe_js.go](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/blob/v5.4.2/utils/ioutil/pipe_js.go) file will only include `github.com/acomagu/bufpipe` if the `js` build tag is set. Similarly, the [github.com/xanzy/ssh-agent](https://github.com/xanzy/ssh-agent/blob/v0.3.1/sshagent_windows.go#L20-L33) package will only include `github.com/Microsoft/go-winio` if the `windows` tag is set (building on a windows environment). This may cause false negatives if the build system is Linux based and the production system runs on Windows. \n\nIt would beneficial to handle this edge case via matrix testing to cover multiple environments. Generating this information and propagating should be scoped within future iterations.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Investigate edge cases, and document them in this issue\n- [x] Document limitations and edges cases in [user docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html)\n  - [x] Document build tags, operating system and architecture edge case. Link https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371779+ which tracks support for specifying build constraints.\n  - [x] Document offline environment requirements for running new go module resolution.\n- [x] Update `gemnasium`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/392+\n  - [x] Add a builder that utilizes the [golang.org/x/tools/go/packages](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/packages) module.\n  - [x] Update the [Go Parse function](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/555fabaf51f20f7de7050f1c23c5e9f5fd93806f/scanner/parser/go/go.go#L13) so that it first attempts to parse a list of modules and if unsuccessful uses the `go.sum` parser.\n  - [x] Add [unit tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/555fabaf51f20f7de7050f1c23c5e9f5fd93806f/scanner/parser/go/go.go#L13) for the cases where a `go-project-modules.json` file is present instead of a `go.sum`.\n  - [x] Update the [Dockerfiles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/tree/555fabaf51f20f7de7050f1c23c5e9f5fd93806f/build/gemnasium) for Gemnasium so that they include the Go toolchain. To avoid dramatically increasing the size of the build, the packages should only be downloaded and installed upon launching the analyzer. The following [Dockerfiles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/tree/add-gemnasium-modlist-cli/build/gemnasium) serve as a basis for enabling this functionality.\n  - [x] Update integration tests based on the `go-modules` test project\n  - [x] Release new version\n     - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/releases/v3.10.0\n- [x]

In the above example, we have two version branches: v1 and v2. To get Composer to check out one of these branches, you must specify a version constraint that looks like this: v1.x-dev. The .x is an arbitrary string that Composer requires to tell it that we're talking about the v1 branch and not a v1 tag (alternatively, you can name the branch v1.x instead of v1). In the case of a branch with a version-like name (v1, in this case), you append -dev as a suffix, rather than using dev- as a prefix.\n\nIFAIU, this is saying that only branches that *exactly* look like versions should be treated with a `-dev` suffix. So, in this case the `-composer-test` part rules that branch name out of this case and hence it should be treated with a `dev-` prefix instead.\n\nSee https://github.com/composer/semver/blob/dd61cb4efbd0cff1700b217faf24ce596af4fc4e/src/VersionParser.php#L168-L170\n\u003e ```\n\u003e // a branch ending with -dev is only valid if it is numeric\n\u003e // if it gets prefixed with dev- it means the branch name should\n\u003e // have had a dev- prefix already when passed to normalize\n\u003e

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nSometimes it is necessary to bypass Merge Results pipelines (if enabled) and Merge Trains (if enabled) when you have a high-priority merge request (for example, a critical patch) that must be merged urgently. But the consequence of having a `Merge immediately` button is the increased risk of merging a breaking change into your target branch. Now project owners/maintainers can disable this default behavior at the project-level by unchecking `Allow merge before pipelines completes`.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nNOTE: This feature is an interim solution for a ~\"merge requests\" ~\"priority::2\" ~bug https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225488.\n\nAs a project maintainer or owner, I want the ability to disable `Merge immediately`, so I can reduce the risk of merging a MR that breaks the main/target branch.\n\nWhen Merge Results pipelines is enabled and/or Merge Trains is enabled, the merge button has an **alternate** path to `Merge immediately` (see [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results/merge_trains/#immediately-merge-a-merge-request-with-a-merge-train)) which can potentially result in a merge that breaks the target branch **IF** the state of the target branch has **changed AFTER** the merge results pipeline succeeded (making whatever it validated outdated).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* Project Owner/Maintainer\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should have a project setting to configure (enable/disable) `Merge immediately` button/capability.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

This expiration is enforced by default.\n- SSH keys have an optional expiration date. This expiration is NOT enforced by default.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThere are 2 problems with opposite expiration enforcement for PATs and SSK keys:\n\n1. UX: We don't want similar features behaving differently, and currently the only difference between PATs and SSH keys is whether expiration is enforced by default (see differences below).\n1. Security: More complexity in code and documentation tends to create more security problems.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- SSH key expiration should be enforced by default, the [same as PAT expiration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3649), starting in 14.0 (because breaking changes should be included in major releases).\n- Users with soon-expiring SSH keys should:\n  - See a warning in the UI, the [same as PAT expiration warnings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34101).\n  - Receive a notification email, the [same as PAT notification emails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19296).\n- The documentation should be updated:\n  - \"The expiration date is informational only, and does not prevent you from using the key.\"\n\n### Technical implementation\n\n- Add db migration to [change default value](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/migration_style_guide.html#changing-the-column-default) for `enforce_ssh_key_expiration` from `false` to `true`\n- Updating default value will **not** change the value for existing instances. For existing database instances, add a data migration to update the column `enforce_ssh_key_expiration` to `true`\n\n### Differences between PATs and SSS keys\n\n![Differences](/uploads/74d6cf4c8e66a7767d41ebc22bc16ee2/Differences.png)\n^ courtesy of @asubramanian1 in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299598#note_513436846\n\n### Related
