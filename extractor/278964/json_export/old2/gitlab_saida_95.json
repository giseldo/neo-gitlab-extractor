Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nFor many use cases, you will need to be able to export your requirements to allow for collaboration with higher level systems, or for audit and regulatory compliance reasons. GitLab now allows for basic exporting \nfor your requirements to ensure seamless collaboration.\n\nThis is the first iteration if this feature, so please provide feedback and follow along in the [Requirements Export Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4672)\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nThis first iteration of requirements export is to allow basic export functionality of requirements. \n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve?

For example:\n    * We might want to force the project's default branch to always be the first item.\n    * Sorting by most recently updated branches might make more sense.\n    * If we do these sort order changes, we might want to make them configurable.\n* TBD: In its initial state, the dropdown should either be blank (with a `Select branch` label), or have the default branch selected by default. We might want to make this configurable as well.\n\nLong-term, we'd like the branches to be fetched via the GraphQL API. Note that our GraphQL doesn't seem to have an endpoint for fetching a project's branches yet, so that would have to be implemented as well.\n\n# What have we looked at?\n\nWe have similar components in a few places in GitLab. Here are the ones we have considered:\n\n## [`app/assets/javascripts/ref/components/ref_selector.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/eb411321f69a03af0b25762d9856086d580628ee/app/assets/javascripts/ref/components/ref_selector.vue)\n\nThis component is used in the **New Release** form: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast-testing/-/releases/new\n\n![ref-selector](/uploads/5227015a2a074a9404903a417f470a12/image.png)\n\nHere are a few reason for _not_ using it:\n\n* It lives in the `ref` directory, which indicates that it hasn't been built to be reused in other places.\n* It's based on a Vuex module, which makes extracting as a reusable component a bit more tedious.\n* It is not limited to selecting branches as it also exposes tags.\n* It uses the REST API to fetch branches. This is fine, but we'd ideally have the option to migrate to the GraphQL API instead.\n\n## [`ee/app/assets/javascripts/approvals/components/branches_select.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/06ab152f04631072a72454c611bd5e08d1f1a330/ee/app/assets/javascripts/approvals/components/branches_select.vue)\n\nThis component is used in the **Add approval rule** form in a project's **Settings \u003e General Merge request approvals** (requires maintainer access to the project).\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-03_at_11.27.46_AM](/uploads/6238cb2735db335c00ee69bf9b93e14f/Screen_Shot_2020-12-03_at_11.27.46_AM.png)\n\nReasons for _not_ using it:\n\n* It is technically tied to the approvals feature (lives in the `approvals` directory, contains some code specific to approvals, etc.).\n* It only fetches protected branches.\n* It uses jQuery and select2.\n* It uses the REST API.\n\n# So what's our plan?\n\nThe components mentioned above being very close to what we need feature-wise, we feel like there's an opportunity to build a shared component that would be inspired by them, and that could replace them down the line if we're able to make it flexible enough. The shared component could be potentially reused anywhere we need to provide a branch selector, like in the **New merge request** form for example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/new\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-03_at_11.38.13_AM](/uploads/0a682a19861761e348c3edc42a88459d/Screen_Shot_2020-12-03_at_11.38.13_AM.png)\n\n# Timeline\n\n1. Gather feedback from engineers in other teams to see how we can best collaborate on building this new component.\n1. Propose an implementation plan for the MVC. The first version should use the REST API as well, because it already exposes the required endpoint.\n1. Implement the required GraphQL endpoint. Might require feedback from ~backend engineers, specifically from ~\"devops::create\".\n1. Refactor the component to use GraphQL instead of REST.\n1. Later iterations, TBD...\n\n/cc @djadmin

\"External Wiki\" integration (`service`) enabled ([see caching method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f6d180c0e1235238cb0df4de5dfaef7d69e135dc/app/models/project.rb#L1345)).\n\nThe purpose is to reduce the number of database lookups needed to build the side menu navigation (when projects have these particular kinds of integrations, they appear in the side menu navigation).\n\n## Problem\n\nThese caches are easy to fall out of consistency when we fail to maintain them during bulk operations (including  PostgreSQL cascading deletes https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48163/) as mentioned in:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273574#note_457006686\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/289798\n\nAs Ecosystem is increasingly changing integration data using bulk operations it would be ideal to find a solution that offers a robust way of maintaining these columns.\n\n## Improvements\n\nThis thread https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273574#note_456689437 explored the idea of using PostgreSQL `TRIGGER`s to maintain the correct state of `has_external_issue_tracker` and `has_external_wiki` columns at all times.\n\nSee: \n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273574#note_458905871\n- The [office hours recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qv1XraWV53JiIap3DKJ_PWqNo3XK1WSO/view?usp=sharing) (internal, relevant bit starts at `30:00`)\n\n## Proposal\n\nWith some help from ~database we hope to write a trigger migration.\n\nThe trigger would be row-level. \n\nIt would run on `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` of the `services` table.\n\nWe understand on `UPDATE` that the trigger can fire conditionally on certain columns being part of the update, in which case, only firing on when the `active`, `type` or `category` columns are updated.\n\nThe SQL that would fire would behave like this (where `ROW` is the row that has executed the trigger):\n\n```sql\n-- **The following is very pseudo-SQL.**\n\n-- This SQL would only need to run if ROW.project_id is not NULL and ROW.type = 'ExternalWikiService'\n--\n-- Set has_external_wiki for the associated project.\n-- A project can only have one \"external wiki service\". \n--\nUPDATE projects\n  SET has_external_wiki = BOOL(ROW.active AND ROW.type = 'ExternalWikiService')\n  WHERE id = ROW.project_id;\n\n-- This SQL would only need to run if ROW.project_id is not NULL AND ROW.category = 'issue_tracker'\n--\n-- Set has_external_issue_tracker for the associated project.\n-- A project can have many \"external issue tracker\" integrations.\n-- \n-- If ROW.active is TRUE then we could:\nUPDATE projects\n  SET has_external_issue_tracker = BOOL(ROW.active AND ROW.category = 'issue_tracker')\n  WHERE id = ROW.project_id;\n-- Otherwise, if ROW.active is FALSE we need to check if any exist for the project that are active:\nnew_has_external_issue_tracker = EXISTS\n        (SELECT 1\n          FROM services\n          WHERE project_id = OLD.project_id\n            AND active = TRUE\n            AND category = 'issue_tracker');\n\nUPDATE projects\n  SET has_external_issue_tracker = new_has_external_issue_tracker\n  WHERE id = ROW.project_id;\n```\n\n## Risks\n\nMost of the risk considerations are around ensuring the trigger would be performant.\n\n## Tests\n\nWe might want to write some unit tests that the database trigger fires when we expect it to.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-03T00:55:53.468Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:53:43.897Z","closed_at":"2021-02-09T00:52:58.379Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke

Composer package registry endpoint request takes \u003e30 seconds","description":"### Summary\n\nComposer will read the package registry endpoint to retrieve new info about package updates. When a GitLab package repository has been configured, the URL Composer reads is `https://\u003cgitlab host\u003e/api/v4/group/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/packages/composer/packages.json` per repository. \n\nBelow is the contents of what that endpoint returns (with some variables masked). It's not much, yet this endpoint takes 30 to 60 seconds to load. The group contains 27k+ packages. It's starting to become so slow that Composer fails to load it and falls back to cache if available. The only thing that looks calculated in this response is the hash, for which 30 - 60 seconds seems an awful lot. This makes the package repository almost unusable for us. Not sure if other package repositories besides Composer are affected.\n\nThis endpoint returns:\n```json\n{\n    packages: [ ],\n    provider-includes: {\n        p/%hash%.json: {\n            sha256: \"\u003chash\u003e\"\n        }\n    },\n    providers-url: \"/api/v4/group/\u003cgroupId\u003e/-/packages/composer/%package%.json\"\n}\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCall the  `https://\u003cgitlab host\u003e/api/v4/group/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/packages/composer/packages.json` endpoint for a group that contains a lot of composer packages.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nLoading times of 30+ seconds.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nLoading times of \u003c10 seconds\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/a3eacf872963a8727889acbe3096b0c7/image.png)\n\n#### GitLab environment info\n\nVersion: GitLab Enterprise Edition 13.6.1-ee \n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI thought https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219171 to be related at first, but looking into more I think it's not.

setting does not reflect actual behavior","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen querying the approval endpoint on a new project where `disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request` was never ticked in the UI, the API returns a null value for this setting.\n\n```\n{\n  \"approvers\": [],\n  \"approver_groups\": [],\n  \"approvals_before_merge\": 0,\n  \"reset_approvals_on_push\": true,\n  \"disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\": null,\n  \"merge_requests_author_approval\": null,\n  \"merge_requests_disable_committers_approval\": null,\n  \"require_password_to_approve\": null\n}\n```\n\nA client would assume that this setting is defaulting to \"false\", meaning \"approvers can overridden\", because it is not disabled (double negative).\n\nWhen testing merge request creation, I can indeed override the needed approvers.\n\n![2020-12-03_13-52_1](/uploads/9be064a8c1f69cf1cffe9ef92f0c96ea/2020-12-03_13-52_1.png)\n\nIn this state, the UI for this checkbox (labeled \"Can override approvers and approvals required per merge request\" which has the inverted meaning) is *not ticked*, which does not reflect the actual behavior.\n\n![2020-12-03_13-52](/uploads/18fe0cdbdc86f70aa251c06593c9c0e2/2020-12-03_13-52.png)\n\nIf I check the checkbox, save, uncheck and save the API returns \"true\" correctly and the UI and API are in sync.\n\nOther values could be affected, I did not check specifically.\n\nIt would be preferable to not rely on null values for booleans in the API, because then the client needs to speculate which might be the default behavior.\n\nA related issue is #276741, but it does not mention the API behavior specifically.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1) Create a project\n2) Query the approval API\n3) Compare API result with the settings in the UI\n4) Create a new MR\n \n### Example Project\n\nIt is trivial to reproduce on a new project.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n- API returns null for disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\n- Merge requests approval *can* be overridden\n- UI shows a not-ticked checkbox\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n- API returns true for disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\n- Merge requests approval *can* be overridden\n- UI shows a ticked checkbox\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com \n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1) Create entries in the database using default values on project creation (I assume this would work, because the behavior is correct after the first save.)\n\n2) Or adjust the fontend to interpret a missing value as \"checked\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-02T06:44:37.257Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T17:41:12.990Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T16:39:41.939Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri

OpenShift](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281816), the following analyzers were updated to run as a non-root user:\n\n* bundler-audit\n* gemnasium root\n* gemnasium-maven\n* gemnasium-python\n* retire.js\n\nHowever, an OpenShift testing instance was not available at the time, so we've been unable to test these analyzers to ensure that they work properly in an OpenShift environment.\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to test the above analyzers in an OpenShift environment, which will be possible once [Openshift Secure testing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/issues/755) has been completed.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software

For large sets, we expect the users to use the filtering capability to narrow it down, but this will not always be possible. Sometimes, the users will not know exactly the name of the group(s) they want to import (or these groups may not have a common filter criterion). In that case, we expect the user to browse through all the available groups to select the ones they need.\n\nFor example, a user may have 200 groups to select from, and with our standard pagination, they will have to go through 10 pages with 20 rows to find the groups they are looking for. We need a way to compensate for this drawback of the current pagination.\n\n### Proposal\n \nImplement the ability to allow the user to select the page size.

`CiConfigJob` entity in the API.\n\nThese are some examples of fields we have in our current lint feature:\n\n- `script` (`beforeScript`, `script`, `afterScript`)\n- `tagList` / `tags`\n- `only`\n- `except`\n- `environment`\n- `when`\n- `allow_failure`\n\n### Example\n\nLint config is currently displayed in a table format like this, in a list of `jobs` or with their details in front of them:\n\n![image](/uploads/e889f3b525c137ae6790000c0a63a413/image.png)\n\nThis table may change formats/styles but we have identified that information in these fields will be useful for users to see details about their CI Config.\n\n### Iteration proposal\n\n- We could work on smaller groups of fields (or just one field at a time!) so we can iterate faster, in case one or more of these fields is more difficult to implement.\n\n### Why work on this?\n\nWith the lint functionality is migrated to the new editor page, we want to have feature parity be showing the fields in the current CI

instead of legacy API for Merge request page Part 1","description":"Now that \\#251015 is complete, we can do this refactor.\n\n| Order | Issue | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| 1 | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/289952 | Creates parent component\n| 2 | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328481 | Use component from Part 1. \n\n## Benefits of this refactor\n\nIf a user overrides the `stage` param defined in the `.base_fuzz` template, by defining a `stage` variable, it will no longer break artifact downloads.\n\n## Original implementation issues for Coverage Fuzzing artifact download buttons:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217151\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210343\n\nWe relied on a fragile assumption that the `.fuzz_base` CI template would not have a particular parameter over-riden by the user. If they replaced the variable, it would cause the artifact download buttons to not show.\n\nA graphQL endpoint was added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251015 to allow us to show artifacts of a particular report type in any given pipeline.\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\n- Remove the VueX module introduced in and used in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217151\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210343\n\n- Replace with GraphQL implementation. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48769 for a sample implementation.\n\nApollo does its own version of state management, so creating a VueX module isn't an ideal pattern. The work done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48769 we can re-use\n\nIn particular:\n\n* The GraphQL Query\n* The dropdown Vue Component\n\n## New Implementation Plan\nNew component should look something like. I opted to not use the scoped slot because right now we only ever render `\u003csecurity-report-download-dropdown /\u003e` in the template. Adding a scoped slot would be optimizing prematurely since we don't have any other component that would go into the slot.\n\n```\n\u003cmerge-request-artifact-download\n   v-if=\"shouldShowDownloadGuidance\"\n   :target-project-full-path=\"targetProjectFullPath\"\n   :mr-iid=\"mrIid\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\n## Old Frontend Implementation Plan\n1. Create a parent renderless component to house the apollo query specific to merge request page, and any other associated logic. This includes the report-type prop.\n1. Add default slot\n1. Unit tests\n\nNew component should look something like\n\n```\n\u003cmerge-request-artifact-download\n   v-if=\"shouldShowDownloadGuidance\"\n   :target-project-full-path=\"targetProjectFullPath\"\n   :mr-iid=\"mrIid\"\n\u003e\n \u003cartifact-download /\u003e\n\u003c/merge-request-artifact-download\u003e\n```\n\n## Old Implementation Plan \n\n* In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/security_reports/grouped_security_reports_app.vue` replace `fuzzing-artifacts-download` for `artifact-download`\n* Remove unused getters and importd\n* Update unit

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe [regular expression](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/877bc64444e697daf1317c1bee0e72f44660c5b0/app/models/namespace.rb#L137) used to remove trailing `.`, `.git` or `.atom` from namespace paths is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service due to backtracking issues when provided with a long malicious string.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nDemonstration on the command line\n\n```shell\nruby -e '(\".\"*50000+\"!\").gsub!(/(\\.atom|\\.git|\\.)*\\z/, \"\")'\n```\n\nThis line will max out the CPU at 100% until killed.\n\nThis regex runs on input from external systems when provisioning accounts as seen by [this

but I don't want to test this on gitlab.com.\n\nI might setup something locally for a better PoC, but I think I can come up with a fix instead of doing that and save the same. :)\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nA malicious string can cause a maxed out CPU on the server. Repeating the attack could tie up a lot of resources on the machine running GitLab.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPath should be cleaned in constant time.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of

hacker can download all the files of master branch in public projects where everything is members only.","description":"**[HackerOne report #1043480](https://hackerone.com/reports/1043480)** by `anshraj_srivastava` on 2020-11-25, assigned to @rchan-gitlab:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nHi team,  \nI found this weird behavior which I thought I should report, a malicious hacker can remotely download files of any branch in a public project where all permissions are ==member-only==, Gitlab uses a link to download files of a branch, normally ==an unauthenticated user will not be able to download the files through the link, he would be shown an error message,== however, the weird behavior is that if ==the admin or someone with the permission to download the files of the branch, clicks on the link, then for a few moments afterward, anyone on the internet can download the file through the link .==\n\nThe link to download files is like this - https://gitlab.com/photographyknavel/my-private-proj-3/-/archive/master/my-private-proj-3-master.zip and ==it can be easily constructed.==\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1.Create a public project and ==change every permission to members-only.==\n\n![recording-1606307452409.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8841726a-fd59-454d-be46-84e854000425/recording-1606307452409.webm)\n\n2.Upload some files in the repository-\n\n![recording-1606307515401.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b51c1b0c-52d3-4e38-b134-7110d482397f/recording-1606307515401.webm)\n\n3.Go to \u0026#34;Branches\u0026#34; and ==try opening the link to download a branch in an incognito tab-==\n\n![recording-1606307568402.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4211b041-7781-42fa-b168-2896b63c5208/recording-1606307568402.webm)\n\n+ As you can see, it shows an error.\n\n4.Now go back to the project and click on the link, no need to download it right now and then go to the incognito window and try opening the link again-\n\n+ This time ==the link opens and we can download the file== from the incognito window even though we are not authenticated-\n\n![recording-1606307655412.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0043c223-4487-4874-bcd9-4bb166a23747/recording-1606307655412.webm)\n\n+ To confirm this bug, ==you can try opening the link on another device too, make sure you do it right after clicking the link from the admin account-==\n\n![Gitlab-vid.MP4](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/185957ac-b16f-444b-9fa7-31e2e69867a9/Gitlab-vid.MP4)\n\n(This video is from my iPad, ==which was on a completely different network and the Gitlab account wasn\u0026#39;t related to the project at all==)\n\n#####  Practical Attack scenario-  \nNow, as you may be wondering that even though the bug exists, the chances of a malicious hacker clicking the link right after an admin does are next to none, ==well this problem can easily be bypassed and the hacker can gain access to the files-==\n\n1.Let\u0026#39;s say that I am a malicious hacker and I discover this project, which has almost all features restricted to members only and as mentioned above, I can\u0026#39;t download the files by clicking on the link-\n\n![recording-1606308245405.webm](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b1af0389-240b-41f0-84df-4f27781bdc0d/recording-1606308245405.webm)\n\n2.However, I am aware of this bug,==so I use a web automation software like Selenium IDE (https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/ )==. I can program a script to refresh this page - https://gitlab.com/photographyknavel/my-private-proj-3/-/archive/master/my-private-proj-3-master.zip automatically, so if the victim ever clicks the download button,==I will be able to download the file since the page is being refreshed frequently and the script will stop if the link is executed.==\n\n####  Selenium Script (also attached as

new ExperimentSubject model with experimentation helper methods","description":"This is a follow-up from #250800.\n\n* adjust the existing `record_experiment_user(…)` method to be `record_experiment_subject(…)`\n* we’ll assume that the type of subject is constant for a given experiment, so each row will be unique by the `experiment_key` and subject values (i.e. for `record_experiment_subject(:exp_key, @group)`, each row in the `experiment_subjects` table would be considered unique by `experiment_id` \u0026 `group_id`).\n\nHere’s an example that replaces some existing usage of `record_experiment_user(…)` with the proposed `record_experiment_subject(…)`:\n\n**Before:**\n\n```ruby\nclass TrialsController \u003c ApplicationController\n  def new\n    record_experiment_user(:remove_known_trial_form_fields)\n    record_experiment_user(:trimmed_skip_trial_copy)\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**After:**\n\n```ruby\nclass TrialsController \u003c ApplicationController\n  def new\n    record_experiment_subject(:remove_known_trial_form_fields, current_user)\n    record_experiment_subject(:trimmed_skip_trial_copy, current_user)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nSince recording the `current_user` as an experiment subject is fairly common, we’ll likely keep the `record_experiment_user` helper method, but replace its internals with `record_experiment_subject(exp_key, current_user)`:\n\n```diff\n       def record_experiment_user(experiment_key)\n-        return if dnt_enabled?\n-        return unless Experimentation.active?(experiment_key) \u0026\u0026 current_user\n-\n-        ::Experiment.add_user(experiment_key, tracking_group(experiment_key, nil, subject: current_user), current_user)\n+        record_experiment_subject(experiment_key, current_user)\n+      end\n+\n+      def record_experiment_subject(experiment_key, subject)\n+        return if dnt_enabled?\n+        return unless Experimentation.active?(experiment_key) \u0026\u0026 subject\n+\n+        ::Experiment.add_subject(experiment_key, tracking_group(experiment_key, nil, subject: subject), subject)\n

([MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48684)) only processes data in the first minutes of the first day of each month.  When you create a segment, you must wait until that scheduled time for DevOps Adoption data to exist for that segment.  So if you create a segment at the beginning of the month, you must wait an entire month to see data.  This is bad for usability generally, and feature discoverability specifically, because users could easily forget they wanted to use the feature!\n\n### Proposal\n\nDevOps Adoption snapshot data should be calculated in the matter of minutes after segment is created (in addition to the existing scheduled updates). \n\n### Tech notes\n\nSchedule a `CreateSnapshotWorker` job as soon as segment is created.\n\n### Related links\n\n- This issue was prompted by this discussion:

Teams Notification can't use special characters in username and/or password for authenticating with proxy","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nCustomers /Organizations that use Microsoft Windows usernames for proxy authentication (format domain\\login) will need to URL encode their URL values in `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` since they contain special characters.\n\nHowever, Gitlab does not attempt to URL-decode those values and then base64 encodes them to be placed in the authentication header, which will result in a `407 Proxy Authentication Required` error since the username and password are incorrect.\n\nExample:\n\nLet's assume that we need to authenticate to our proxy with username `YYYYY\\XXXX` and password: `RBr%S]axMD-F1S?`\n\nWe will need to add our credentials to the proxy URL (the `gitlab.rb` file).\n\nThe URL will need to be URL-encoded otherwise we will get errors (not on reconfigure but we we want to bring up the rails console, or run rake tasks)\n\nSo then we need to have the following entries:\n\n```\ngitlab_rails['env'] = {\n   \"http_proxy\" =\u003e 'http://YYYYY%5CXXXX:RBr%25S%5DaxMD-F1S%3F@127.0.0.1:3128' ,\n   \"https_proxy\" =\u003e 'http://YYYY%5CXXXXX:RBr%25S%5vxMD-F1S%3F@127.0.0.1:3128' ,\n   \"no_proxy\" =\u003e \"localhost,127.0.0.1\"\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that certain proxies expect a base64 value the credentials that is URL-decoded , but Gitlab sends the base64 encoded value of the URL-encoded http(s)_proxy URL.\n\nSo in our example Gitlab will send:\n\n```\nWVlZWVklNUNYWFhYOlJCciUyNVMlNURheE1ELUYxUyUzRg==\n```\n\nwhich is the equivalent of \n\n```\necho -n \"YYYYY%5CXXXX:RBr%25S%5DaxMD-F1S%3F\" | base64\n```\n\nbut it should actually send:\n\n```\nWVlZWVlcWFhYWDpSQnIlU11heE1ELUYxUz8=\n```\n\nwhich is the equivalent of:\n\n```\necho -n \"YYYYY\\XXXX:RBr%S]axMD-F1S?\" | base64\n```\n\nAs a reference, running:\n\n```\ncurl -v --proxy 'http://YYYYY%5CXXXX:RBr%25S%5DaxMD-F1S%3F@127.0.0.1:3128/' https://outlook.office.com\n```\nYields:\n\nProxy auth using Basic with user 'YYYYY\\XXXX'\n\u003e CONNECT outlook.office.com:443 HTTP/1.1\n\u003e Host: outlook.office.com:443\n\u003e Proxy-Authorization: Basic WVlZWVlcWFhYWDpSQnIlU11heE1ELUYxUz8=\n\n(the Proxy-Authorization headed value is the URL-decoded one and the proxy is able to properly authenticate the user).\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

@furkanayhan \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nIf the feature is not used, we expect nothing is changed.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nPossible errors:\n- Pipelines may not be started\n- Pipeline variables may be wrongly assigned\n\nThese errors can not occur unless the project actively uses the new feature.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nN/A\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n- ...\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Confirm that QA tests pass with the feature flag enabled (if you're unsure how, contact the relevant [stable counterpart in the Quality department](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/#individual-contributors))\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [x] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set

Get the tags list (GET `/v2/#{name}/tags/list`)\n   - The whole list is retrieved in a single call. No pagination. The list is simply an array of names.\n1. For each tag, get its manifest (GET `/v2/#{name}/manifests/#{reference}\"`)\n   - The policy specifies how many tags to retain. To compute that, the backend needs to have the `created` timestamp and order the list by it. The `create` timestamp is not returned by (1.), so a request per tag must be done to get this field.\n1. For each tag to delete, delete it (DELETE `/v2/#{name}/tags/reference/#{reference}`)\n\n(1.) + (2.) is the preparation of the cleanup. In short, computing the list of tags to delete.\n\n(3.) is the actual cleanup.\n\nCurrently, (3.) is limited in time (250s for ~\"gitlab.com\" ) to prevent resources starvation but (1.) + (2.) is not limited at all and can't be splitted because to compute the number of tags to be retained, the whole list has to be ordered.\n\nThis gives us this total number of network requests of: `2 * t + 1` where `t` is the number of tags.\n\nWe have a linear relationship and this will not work for repositories with a high number of tags to delete. For example, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG-mirror/container_registry/135403 has 3K tags -\u003e we would be doing at list 3K network requests as a strict minimum.\n\nThis is a blocker for \"heavy\" repositories.\n\n## Improvements\n\nBased on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288812#note_456138284:\n\n* Hard limit the list of tags to process\n   * Do it only if https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238190 is enabled\n   * Add proper logs\n   * The limit should be an application setting and have a proper default. 500?\n* The trade off is:\n   * We could keep a tag that in the end would be deleted. As such, we're making more requests to the container registry in overall than if we could handle the whole list at once.\n\n## Risks\n\nRegarding cleanup policies, the most important aspect is the accuracy: don't delete the tags that are not meant to be deleted.\n\nSince this issue is about building the base list to apply the filters on and not the application of the filters itself, I would say that the risk is low.\n\n## Involved components\n\n* `app/services/projects/container_repository/cleanup_tags_service.rb`","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-27T09:57:50.104Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:03:29.451Z","closed_at":"2021-01-20T10:07:11.305Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","bug::performance","devops::package","group::package registry","package:active","quad-planning::complete-no-action","ruby","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":45,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288812","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288812","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288812/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288812/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#288812","relative":"#288812","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#288812"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2270,"epic":{"id":15539,"iid":2270,"title":"Cleanup policy for tags","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2270","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75049055,"iid":288343,"project_id":278964,"title":"Can't see the last file in the tree view","description":"When opening the tree view in the changes tab of a merge request, and if I started a review, I cannot see the last file in the tree.

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48457#note_455014428):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **Thought (non-blocking):** I wonder if instead of simply encouraging weekly aggregation, we should help PM to understand differences between `daily` and `weekly` aggregations, and how `weekly` should be sufficient for the most of cases.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Form what I picked up in code and in the documentation of usage ping https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/product_analytics/usage_ping.html#known-events-in-usage-data-payload\n    \u003e \u003e - #{event_name}_weekly: Data for 7 days for daily aggregation events and data for the last complete week for weekly aggregation events.\n    \u003e \u003e - #{event_name}_monthly: Data for 28 days for daily aggregation events and data for the last 4 complete weeks for weekly aggregation events.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e In context of business analysis, the only difference that is between both aggregations is how weekly and monthly time spans are selected for counting unique events, but selecting `daily` aggregation does not bring more detailed or fine grained data.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-26T10:57:39.184Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T10:54:52.380Z","closed_at":"2021-01-08T10:54:52.337Z","closed_by":{"id":5365921,"username":"alinamihaila","name":"Alina

Possibly related to having many many groups?\n\n1. Create an MR.\n2. Attempt to add an approval rule.\n3. Enter a user or group to filter the `Approvers` dropdown.\n\n### Example Project\n\nIt happens frequently on projects created in the `gitlab-qa-sandbox-group` group as part of the QA tests on Staging. For example: https://staging.gitlab.com/gitlab-qa-sandbox-group/qa-test-2020-11-26-08-54-27-cf4fca2b42a29d99/approval-rules-b01350a2d5aa2e0c\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nSometimes \"Searching...\" and the loading spinner appear but the drop-down is never populated.\n\n![approval_spinner](/uploads/9c6420ada484d45bbb4f9b95f84c7740/approval_spinner.png)\n\nThe network request for `api/v4/groups.json` returns `500 Internal Server Error`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe API request is successful and the drop-down loads.\n\n**OR** the API request is unsuccessful and the UI displays an appropriate error message.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nExample failed request on Staging:

all 3 gemnasium analyzers","description":"## Summary\n\nMake all 3 gemnasium analyzers share the same codebase. gemnasium-maven and gemnasium-python are implemented in gemnasium, and code is shared using git submodules. See https://gitlab.com/fcatteau/gemnasium-git-submodule for a PoC.\n\nUpdate [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) to cover all types of projects, including Java and Python projects. The `gemnasium` CLI is able to handle all sorts of projects, including Java and Python projects. Supported package managers can be set at run-time, using environment variables.\n\nThe build remains specific to each project, and [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) and [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) each have a distinct `Dockerfile` and a distinct CI configuration file. \n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- update [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) to emulate other projects\n   - [ ] copy relevant source code from [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven)\n   - [ ] copy relevant source code from [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python)\n   - [ ] enable all builders, file parsers, and vrange plugins\n   - [ ] enable or disable these are runtime, based on CLI flags, so that the CLI can behave like `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven`, or `gemnasium-python`\n- update [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) to use [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) as a git submodule\n   - [ ] update Dockerfile to use git submodule, and set build arguments to behave like before\n   - [ ] copy expected reports to `gemnasium` project, and update test projects accordingly\n   - [ ] README update and project cleanup\n- update [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) to use [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) as a git submodule\n   - [ ] update Dockerfile to use git submodule, and set build arguments to behave like before\n   - [ ] copy expected reports to `gemnasium` project, and update test projects accordingly\n   - [ ] README update and project cleanup\n\nUser doc, developer doc, and CI template don't change.\n\nProject build, CI config, and versioning don't change.\n\n## Improvements\n\n- There's a single CLI that supports everything (if the runtime environment satisfies all the dependencies).\n- It's easy to use a particular branch of `gemnasium` in the other projects.\n\n## Risks\n\nNone identified\n\n## Involved components\n\n* [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium)\n* [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python)\n* [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven)\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\nNone","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-25T15:44:33.490Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:03:35.543Z","closed_at":"2020-12-11T15:15:33.573Z","closed_by":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","blocked","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","section::sec","type::maintenance"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288063","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":10,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 10 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288063","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288063/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288063/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#288063","relative":"#288063","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#288063"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74976653,"iid":288049,"project_id":278964,"title":"When creating a branch the Web IDE and single file editor do not expire branch/tag cache","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen a new branch is created via the Web IDE or the single file editor the branch / tag name cache is not expired.\n\nThis poses a security problem because it allows a pipeline to be ran on an ambiguous ref. There is an ambiguity check in the pipeline creation chain, but the branch/tag name cache still doesn't contain the name of the newly created branch/tag which causes the check to pass when in reality it should fail. This allows users to create a branch with the same name as a tag and trigger a pipeline for the tag, possibly leaking protected variables.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-25T14:24:48.560Z","updated_at":"2022-07-04T14:32:26.506Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T20:15:35.028Z","closed_by":{"id":4992072,"username":"dcouture","name":"Dominic Couture","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4992072/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dcouture"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Category:Web IDE","Deliverable","SaaS","backend","devops::create","group::source code","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::dev","security","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":52,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-07-22","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288049","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288049","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288049/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/288049/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#288049","relative":"#288049","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#288049"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
