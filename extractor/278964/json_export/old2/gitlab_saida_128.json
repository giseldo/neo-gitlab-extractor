If I am typing quickly (as developers are known to do) just trying to get through the form, I don't expect this field to be filled out when I get there. Once I realize that the field is not what I expected (sometimes after submission) I have to go back and alter my user name to what I meant it to be.\n\nJustification: It's standard SaaS software practice to create your own username at product signup.\n\n## Solution\n\nRemove auto creation of usernames to resolve user friction when completing the trial form. \n\n## Approach\n\nWe'll opt to remove the automated username creation as a `net improvement` to the trial creation flow and monitor the conversion rate of the view of screen 1 (signup screen) `/-/trial_registrations/new` to view of screen 2 (email confirmation screen) `/users/almost_there` before/after the change to lightly monitor no large negative trends.\n\n## Proposed Experience\n\nWith the removal of the automated username creation functionality, the free user and trial signup forms will both require the user to create their own user name.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-01-13_at_4.10.42_PM](/uploads/9678f7ad467cf21a2a4acef2df37cdab/Screen_Shot_2022-01-13_at_4.10.42_PM.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-16T22:03:01.466Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T07:04:30.423Z","closed_at":"2022-01-25T21:09:55.675Z","closed_by":{"id":3841241,"username":"dstull","name":"Doug Stull","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d7b8532bca28f593b193b012841a40?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dstull"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::growth","group::acquisition","milestone::p3","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","section::growth","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":3841241,"username":"dstull","name":"Doug Stull","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d7b8532bca28f593b193b012841a40?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dstull"}],"author":{"id":4226514,"username":"jstava","name":"Jensen Stava","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226514/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jstava"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3841241,"username":"dstull","name":"Doug Stull","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d7b8532bca28f593b193b012841a40?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dstull"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224455","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224455","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224455/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224455/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#224455","relative":"#224455","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#224455"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4161,"epic":{"id":91722,"iid":4161,"title":"Q3 Conversion iterative experiments","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4161","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 31, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":45658767,"iid":222790,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display one file at a time when reviewing code","description":"From this [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/22427#note_311904034)\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen reviewing large merge request that encompass a large number of files, the MR/diff section becomes cluttered and it's hard to keep track of which files need attention.

Use correct URL in iteration list within projects: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39862\n\nThis change is behind the feature flag `:project_iterations`.\n\n## Release Notes\n\nIterations are currently created at the Group level and there is no way to view an Iteration's report within the context of a Subgroup or Project. Not only is this is problematic for organizations that prefer to operate according to the [principle of lease privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), it makes it difficult and confusing for a larger organization to utilize the same Iteration cadence while also providing a way for each Group and Project to track their progress. To solve for this, Iterations are now inherited down a Group's hierarchy providing each Subgroup and Project the ability to view an Iteration Report scoped to the context in which it is being viewed.\n\nThis change also allows Organizations to have more flexibility and control over how they want to use Iterations. They can be configured from the top level Group to align all Groups and Projects on the same schedule or each Subgroup can manage their own Iteration cadence independently of one another.

tokens","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWith the [option](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214723) to toggle enforcement of personal access token expiration, we [provided](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34570) the ability for users to view their tokens that have expired yet are active.\n\nThey are listed under https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens\n- `Active Personal Access Tokens` section\n\nAs noted [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214723#note_362195314), there is scope for improving the UX by more clearly indicating to the user that an action is required on the tokens.\n\nThe idea was to revisit this section once this feature gets more matured, with user feedback and other aspects built around it.\n\n### Intended users\n\nUsers that do not have Personal Access Tokens automatically revoked when they expire.\n\n### Proposal\n\nExtracting suggestions from the [note](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214723#note_362195314):\n\n- [x] Add a clarifying description when [revoke on expiration is not enforced](). \n\u003e Personal access tokens are not revoked upon expiration.\n\n- [x] When a token has expired, show a dismissable alert, that will reappear when the page is refreshed\n\u003e **# token(s) expired**\n\u003e\n\u003e Until revoked, expired personal access tokens pose a security risk.\n\n- [x] Move the `Scopes` column to right after the `Name` column.\n- [x] Update the warning text hex color to match Pajamas\n- [x] Only use the Primary Danger button for PAT that have expired, and use Secondary Danger button for everything else\n\n|Current vs Proposed ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/c6pqPpmgwQ7x5jG8DLXfFJ/222734-Listing-expired-active-tokens?node-id=597%3A7))|\n|---|\n|![Comparison](/uploads/df946368efa4b04df5c6bf63793107f7/Comparison.png)|\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- Easy identification of tokens that require immediate attention\n- Ability to clearly distinguish Personal Access Token states\n\n### Links / references\n\n[Discussion

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWhen listing the files of very large folders (thousands of files and folders), the Vue Repository Browser will attempt to render ALL of them in sequence.\n\nThe truth is, resources are limited and at a certain point, the tab freezes and crashes. :(\n\nAs can be seen in the forgeperf.com analysis of https://gitlab.com/ddevault/linux/-/tree/master/arch/arm/boot/dts\n\n![Screenshot_2020-06-16_at_17.17.53](/uploads/5317d67bbc031b4f24ce57e7f09af6c3/Screenshot_2020-06-16_at_17.17.53.png)\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nAllow user to explore the long list of folders without freezing the browser. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n1. Introduce a stopping point at which we stop rendering the files and display: \"Load more files\" call to action.\n1. That call to action will trigger requesting an extra X amount of files / the rest (potential to break the browser again but a good first step)\n\n\n### Further details\n\nIt will stop the browsers from crashing while rendering content the user is not even seeing.\n\nPitfalls: it might break the native \"Find in this page\" feature, but we already have the fuzzy file finder as a workaround.\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nA better score in performance metrics / forgeperf.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nAny client concerned about better performance.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAfter we deliver https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218841, we want to make it easy to create local task revisions and push them to AWS. Our current solution only allows pushing existing revisions that are already located in AWS ECS, but it is very likely that users would want to create new task definitions from their local machine and push them. \n\nWe [recently added support for deploying your applications to ECS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_deployment/#deploy-your-application-to-the-aws-elastic-container-service-ecs). \n\nToday, the [ECS template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/-/tree/master/aws/ecs) updates existing task definitions (by making a copy of an existing task definition and then creating a new revision of this task definition based on this copy - only the docker image location of the app changes)\n users deploying to ECS can only connect to task definitions which are already defined in their attached AWS account. \n\nHowever - when updating your application it's common for users to also update their task-definition as part of their GitLab flow. This issue makes it possible to update the .json task definition in your local repository and push it knowing that the task will get appropriately created in your AWS account as part of your standard development flow.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

I used private groups and private projects.  \n1 - As \"userA\" Create a private Group.  \n2 - User A configures the Group to require 2fa, set \"Time before enforced\" to 0 to test this now.  \n3 - User A invites user B to the private Group, give him a role so he can push code(Developer minimum)  \n4 - User B tries to access Gitlab through the Web, you can see it is required to set up 2fa, you are always redirected to [2fa settings] page(https://gitlab.com/profile/two_factor_auth)  \n6 - UserB can, however, bypass this restriction using the git command *without* the personal access token, only using his username, and password, I used   \nhttps://gitlab.com/anothergroup1/spring-security-group/test-project as an example, you can see I succeed to clone AND push(read and write).  \n```

you want to enforce 2FA for users, that means you want to add an extra layer of security so user credentials that get compromised would not be able to be used to leak and push code, however, this does not happen with the `git` command.\n\n### Examples\n\n(If the bug is project related, please create an example project and export it using the project export feature)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also help determine whether the bug has been fixed in a more recent version)\n\n(If the bug can be reproduced on GitLab.com without violating the `Rules of Engagement` as outlined in the program policy, please provide the full path to the project.)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nBroken access control: allows users to read/write code only using credentials, no 2FA is enforced whatsoever.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nif 2FA is enabled for a group to restrict access, a user should not be able to read nor write code unless he has 2FA enabled.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf you want to enforce 2FA for users, that means you want to add an extra layer of security so user credentials that get compromised would not be able to be used to leak and push code, however, this does not happen with the `git` command.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-16T08:55:13.959Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T12:55:00.582Z","closed_at":"2021-09-30T18:38:21.717Z","closed_by":{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle

Being a first-class object means each has a unique URL, allowing linking directly to any vulnerability's details. While a big improvement in visibility and consistency, references to vulnerabilities within Issues and Epics must still be copy-pasted as manual markdown links. This makes sharing and referencing vulnerabilities within other areas of GitLab more cumbersome and less efficient than sharing other objects such as Issues.\n\nVulnerabilities can now be linked via special references. They are the first to use a new `[object_type:ID]` syntax that will eventually extend to other existing references. You can now quickly insert a link to a vulnerability from anywhere you might normally use a special reference such as an Issue or MR comment. For instance, simply type `[vulnerability:123]` in an Issue comment to insert a link back to the vulnerability with ID 123 in the same project. You can also prefix the ID with a namespace or project to reference vulnerabilities outside the current project context.\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#special-gitlab-references\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nStandalone vulnerabilities brought unique URLs per vulnerability but references to them within Issues and Epics must still be copy-pasted as manual markdown links. This makes sharing and referencing vulnerabilities within other areas of GitLab more cumbersome and less efficient than sharing other objects such as Issues.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nReferencing a vulnerability inside GitLab should be as easy as referencing an Issue or Epic.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a new [Special Reference type](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#special-gitlab-references) to quickly reference vulnerability objects from places such as Issue and Epic descriptions and comments.\n\n### Further details\n\nWe will need to add a new [GitLab Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm) operator for vulnerability quick references that does not collide with other markdown quick actions or references. Vulnerability special references should work in the same locations an Issue special reference works. This includes:\n\n* Issue descriptions\n* Issue comments\n* Epic descriptions\n* Epic comments\n* MR descriptions\n* MR comments\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nUsers can only create references (via markdown quick actions) to vulnerabilities they have at least read permissions for.  This of course does not apply to a users manually inserting via markdown vulnerability URLs to which they do not have permission.\n\nWhen relying on the auto-suggest feature (after typing, for example, ^ and one or more numbers, just like Issue auto-suggest), the user is never shown suggestions for vulnerabilities to which they have no access.\n\nA user that clicks on a special reference to a vulnerability to which they do not have access will receive an error message (403 is acceptable but 404 preferred keeping in line with least information exposed practice).\n\n\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n\n* Within 30 days of release, at least 10 users create at least 1 vulnerability special reference\n* Within 90 days, at least 50 users create at least 1 vulnerability special reference\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n* Starting with the new special reference character (e.g. ^) and beginning to type numbers will start auto-suggesting vulnerabilities *to which the current user has permission* based on the numbers typed. Speed of suggestion and waiting for typing pauses before suggesting should match that for Issue special references.\n* Manually inserting markdown for a new special reference (e.g. ^13457) properly converts to the appropriate vulnerability page URL when the markdown page/component (e.g. a comment) is \"saved\"/finalized.\n* The new special reference works from the same locations in GitLab where an Issue special reference works.\n* The new special reference is added to all appropriate documentation sections including relevant markdown instructions\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nAlmost certainly, yes. Will need to evaluate which other Group(s) are affected by adding a new special reference.\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] ~backend Create placeholder model in CE for `Vulnerability`, move logic from `ee/models/vulnerability.rb` to `EE::Vulnerability` module and prepend it in the model defined in CE.

The test was held June 1-11, 2020.\n\n## Description\n\nGitlab has a history of attackers leveraging symlinks within Project Imports to perform file read and file write operations. Gitlab has attempted to mitigate symlink attacks by removing symlinks before and after tar file extraction via the remove_symlinks function. However, a race condition exists after symlink files are written to the file system and before the re- move_symlinks function has been called.\n\n```ruby\ndef import mkdir_p(@shared.export_path)\n        mkdir_p(@shared.archive_path)\n        remove_symlinks\n        copy_archive\n\n        wait_for_archived_file do \n          decompress_archive\n        end rescue =\u003e e\n          @shared.error(e)\n        false ensure\n          remove_import_file\n          remove_symlinks\n        end\n```\n\nIn the past, attackers have crafted Project tar files with a symlink in the uploads directory: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/55501. For file reads, symlinks are pointed to sensitive files like /etc/passwd and the attacker is able to open the file via requests to /uploads/\u003csecret\u003e. For file writes, the same project is imported again which overwrites an existing symlink.\nTo circumvent symlink removal, an attacker could upload a crafted Project tar.gz file, where tar extracts the symlink to the file system first, then takes 10 seconds to extract the rest of the tar.gz file. Within this window if an attacker is able to access the symlink, an arbitrary file read would be possible.\nIt should be noted that Gitlab has put in place additional security restrictions that makes symlink attacks more difficult, notably:\n• Migration from legacy file storage to hashed storage: legacy file storage used predictable namespaces which allowed attackers to overwrite the same project on disk during project import. This allowed existing symlink files to be predictably overwritten. Hashed storage generates new directories for every project import based on incremental project IDs. Due to time constraints, the engagement team was not able to confirm a working PoC.\n\nLocation: `/lib/gitlab/import_export/file_importer.rb`\n\n## Recommendation \n\nGitlab should programmatically check if a file is a symlink before extracting the file to disk.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T17:06:56.913Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T14:36:40.834Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T14:30:21.947Z","closed_by":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris

[x] Cleanup the work that was done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31136/diffs\n    - [x] Revert the changes done in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/filter.vue`\n    - [x] Revert the changes done in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/filters.vue` and its specs\n    - [x] Stop passing the reports summary down the filters in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/security_dashboard_vuex.vue`\n- [x] Update the GraphQL query in the frontend to match the final schema that was implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31550.\n- [x] Create a new `SecurityReportsSummary` component\n    - [x] The component is based on [`GlCollapse`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-collapse--default)\n    - [x] We'll want to store the collapsed/expanded state in the local storage\n    - [x] The component receives `securityReportSummary` as a prop\n        - **note:** we could potentially move the GraphQL query to the new component, but keeping it in the parent component makes it easier to reuse if we ever wanted to display similar summaries somewhere else.\n    - [x] Hide summary entries if the corresponding scanner is `null` in the GraphQL response (= scanner is not setup). The ~backend for this will be done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223073\n    - [x] Add unit tests\n- [x] Extend the `PipelineSecurityDashboard` component's template to include the `SecurityReportsSummary` component","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T15:50:52.624Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:34:36.058Z","closed_at":"2020-06-26T14:04:49.597Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::secure","frontend","group::dynamic analysis","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"}],"author":{"id":5412787,"username":"nmccorrison","name":"Neil McCorrison","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5412787/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmccorrison"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222374","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":12,"completed_count":12},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"12 of 12 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222374","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222374/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222374/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#222374","relative":"#222374","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#222374"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3728,"epic":{"id":73339,"iid":3728,"title":"Show security reports summary in pipelines' Security Dashboard","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3728","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":43897780,"iid":222373,"project_id":278964,"title":"Search API - Allow notes scope for group search","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

UI allows users to use Advanced Global Search to search for `notes` scope\n\nThe Search API does not allow the `notes` scope.\n\n### Intended users\n\nAll users of search, but I picked out a few personas from the list that I thought may be the in based on the descriptions.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps

Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to use the Web UI and API search with the same scopes.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSearch API Group search should allow the notes scope.\n\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Updates to the [Search API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/search.html#group-search-api) will be needed\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nWill need to add tests for the new scope in areas where they already exist for the Group Search API \n\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test changes (will need to get with the Quality stable counterpart on this)\n* Performance test changes\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance:

Display new value stream with toast message (3000ms) to confirm creation\n\n| Button | Modal | Toast |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![VSA_-_create](/uploads/67050948b0bb0373a88b6e364fbbc2b9/VSA_-_create.png) | ![VSA_-_create_modal](/uploads/ff9cebb4d5d8ecad8c33ec143a8e98ff/VSA_-_create_modal.png) | ![VSA_-_create_toast](/uploads/71bc65e5982dea9cfdd3308898bf21e7/VSA_-_create_toast.png) |\n\n[See Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/18iGTnYetvactQwyO6s4Pp/Value-Stream?node-id=69%3A1944)\n\n### Out of scope\n\nSwitching between multiple value streams is handled in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221204\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n- Permissions for creating new Value Streams is the same as those for configuring them generally.\n\n### Feature Flag\n\n- Initially, make available to gitlab-org group on gitlab.com\n- After PM request, make more broadly available from internal users and addressing any concerns about scaling.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n- This feature will be made available in ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T12:16:21.037Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T10:02:50.532Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T10:02:50.471Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","group::optimize","missed:13.2","ready for merge","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222337","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222337","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222337/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222337/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#222337","relative":"#222337","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#222337"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":43661439,"iid":222330,"project_id":278964,"title":"Monitor usage ping on 13.2","description":"This is a followup for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217706\n\n# Transferred issues\n- [ ] Gitlab.com usage ping doesn't send scheduled cronjob pings https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220483\n- [x] Harden CI pipelines usage data queries https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220477\n- [x] Harden security ci build job queries https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220481\n- [x] Harden operations_dashboard_default_dashboard usage data queries https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220479\n- [x] Harden `users_created` usage data queries https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220478\n\n\n# Fix and check new usage counters which time out\n\n1.

We can continue using L1/L2 caches of `Feature` class. Most of the times, flag data are returned from cache layers, so it barely requests to Feature Flag server.\n- We can expect more active users in GitLab's feature flag as [Flipper](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper) is one of the most popular feature flag system in ruby community ([Flipper](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper): 2.2k stars and used by 303 projects.

The new API can be used by any Flipper projects regardless of the scale (Ruby projects only, for the other language, unleash APIs can be used).\n- This encourages us to build a generic UI/UX, which allows us to support more various Feature Flag clients with GitLab Feature Flag.\n\n## Schema Mapping\n\n|GitLab UI      | Unleash's strategy | Flipper's gate | Example of value |\n| ------        | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|All users      | `default` | `boolean` | `true` |\n|User IDs       | `userWithId` | `actors` | `Project:123` |\n|Percent rollout (Based on User ID)| [`flexibleRollout`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36380) or `gradualRolloutUserId` | `percentage_of_actors` | 50 |\n|Percent rollout (Random)| [`flexibleRollout`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36380) | `percentage_of_time` | 50 |\n\n**Flipper**\n\n`GET /features`\n\n```\nfeatures:\n  - key:\n    state: \n    gates:\n      - key: (boolean/groups/actors/percentage_of_actors/percentage_of_time)\n        name:\n        value:\n```\n\n**Unleash**\n\n`GET features`\n\n```\nfeatures:\n  - name:\n    description:\n    enabled:\n    strategies:\n      - name:\n        parameters:\n```\n\n## Endpoints\n\nWe replicate [the endpoints for Flipper API](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/master/docs/api/README.md)\n\n```\nGET         /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features(.:format)                                      - Get all features\nPOST        /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features(.:format)                                      - Create a new feature\nGET         /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name(.:format)                        - Retrieve a feature\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name(.:format)                        - Delete a feature\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/clear(.:format)                  - Clear a feature\nPOST        /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/boolean(.:format)                - Boolean enable a feature\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/boolean(.:format)                - Boolean disable a feature\nPOST        /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/groups(.:format)                 - Enable Group\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/groups(.:format)                 - Disable Group\nPOST        /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/actors(.:format)                 - Enable Actor\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/actors(.:format)                 - Disable Actor\nPOST        /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/percentage_of_actors(.:format)   - Enable Percentage of Actors\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/percentage_of_actors(.:format)   - Disable Percentage of Actors\nPOST        /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/percentage_of_time(.:format)     - Enable Percentage of Time\nDELETE      /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/features/:feature_name/percentage_of_time(.:format)     - Disable Percentage of Time\nGET         /api/:version/feature_flags/flipper/:project_id/actors/:flipper_id(.:format)                            - Check if features are enabled for an actor\n```\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Add endpoints for reading flags\n- [ ] Add endpoints for enabling gates\n- [ ] Add endpoints for disabling gates\n- [ ] Documentation\n  - [the endpoints is implemented based on Flipper API](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/master/docs/api/README.md)\n  - The schema mapping between Flipper and Unleash\n\n## Auth\n\n- Flipper client includes `instance_id` in request header and GitLab authorizes the requests if it's sent by a valid client.\n- If it's a valid token, the client can CRUD feature flags\n- If it's not a valid token, the client get an 401 error code\n- If the project id is not found, the client get an 404 error code\n\n## NOTE\n\n- This feature is going to be shipped as alpha feature, and is going to be evaluated in [infrastructure issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/10550).

Problem\nA recent hiccup in the License app on 2020-06-09 caused a problem for some seat link requests being made on that day.  The requests which originate from self-managed instances via the `SyncSeatLinkRequestWorker` to the customers app failed because the customers app couldn't authenticate the request using the License app which caused the requests to fail.  However, retrying the requests later should have resolved the errored jobs.  This didn't happen because as it turns out the `SyncSeatLinkRequestWorker` was using the retry count default of 3 instead of something larger.

Checks `update_now?(import_state)` and calls `import_state.force_import_job!`\r\n\r\nNow here lies the problem. Calling `force_import_job!` on a mutated `ProjectImportState` with a `retry_count` of `0` doesn't work because it does an early return because `mirror_update_due?` is `true`. This is because `hard_failed?` is now `false` on this mutated object.\r\n\r\nWe worked around this by calling `project.import_state.force_import_job!` in the console. This worked and scheduled the next mirror because in the console context, the `retry_count` is still `15`.\r\n\r\nI believe this bug was introduced by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commit/79052fc84185afd82279d9aa2bde037d016da869. cc @patrickbajao \r\n\r\ncc @arihantar \r\n\r\nNote: When the last attempt was less than 5 minutes ago, clearing the hard failure works fine because it just updates the `next_execution_timestamp` directly.\r\n\r\nCustomer ticket (internal): https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/160056","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-12T15:07:44.684Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T04:12:23.940Z","closed_at":"2020-06-17T13:09:27.432Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"labels":["customer","devops::create","group::source code","priority::2","regression","regression:13.0","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"}],"author":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221321","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221321","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221321/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221321/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#221321","relative":"#221321","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#221321"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":42973949,"iid":221288,"project_id":278964,"title":"Instance-level dashboard CSS is uncentered for unconfigured state and project selection","description":"### Summary\n\nInstance-level dashboard CSS is uncentered for unconfigured state and project selection\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\nThe goal of the GitLab Package Group is to have 90% of userbase rely on GitLab for all of their package management needs. In order to achieve this goal, we need to both [add support for a wide variety of package manager formats](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1245) and build a robust set of features that will be sufficient for our customers to replace their existing package manager vendors.\n\nWe would like to help drive the adoption of these features so that we can get more feedback on how to improve them and make them even more useful in your everyday workflows. And, as we've been working with the community on contributions for [Composer (PHP)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/15886) and [Cargo (Rust)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33060), we've heard several requests move these features to core.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nAs part of GitLab's [stewardship promises](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/#what-features-are-paid-only), we would like to move the basic functionality for each package manager format to the GitLab Core Edition. This means that for npm, Maven, NuGet, Conan and any future formats, you will be able to:\n\n* Establish GitLab as a private repository\n* Authenticate using your GitLab credentials, personal access or job token\n* Publish packages to GitLab\n* Pull packages from GitLab\n* Search for packages hosted on GitLab\n* Access an easy-to-use UI that displays package details and metadata and allows you to download any relevant files\n* Ensure that your contributions are available for ALL GitLab users\n### Further details\n\n#### MR Breakdown\n1. Move dependency files and code (fixtures, helper classes, etc)\n1. Remove license checks in the backend\n1. Move models\n1. Move controlers/apis (with the dependencies moved and license removed, it should be able to be done with a simple move)\n1. Remove checks in the UI and license\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this change\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

Today users can only associate milestone to releases at the project level. To make sure the right information is accessible from different product areas, we want users to be able to see the releases associated to a group milestone in the Milestone overview page.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nUser should see and be able to interact with releases associated to a group milestone in the Milestone overview page.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n#### User story\n\n\u003e As a user, I want to see which releases are associated to my group milestone, so that I can have quick access to important details and assets of each individual release.\n\n##### Acceptance criteria\n\n- Users should be able to add group milestones to releases as per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121476\n- In the Group Milestone overview page, user should see when a release is associated to a group milestone.\n- In the milestone card item, a new section for `Release` should be added to the UI.\n  - _See example from a project milestone below:_\n  - ![Screen_Shot_2020-06-11_at_12.41.58](/uploads/1c67e3119bbc7964ffef0381d1aac4ed/Screen_Shot_2020-06-11_at_12.41.58.png)\n- When a release is associated to a group milestone, the name of the release should be displayed link to the Release detail view.\n  - `0` to `N` releases can be associated to a group milestone.\n- When no releases are associated to a group milestone, no information should be rendered in the UI.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nDepends on the implementation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121476\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nYes, this feature requires updates to the Releases and Milestones documentation pages.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCustomers setting up the Elasticsearch Integration for Advanced Global Search in self-managed instances often are unsure how big their cluster will need to be and as a consequence may be unsure if they can run the cluster.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn the Elasticsearch integration page we could display an estimate of the amount of storage you will need. Since [we expect around 0.31 * repo size](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/10482#note_356649050) and since we can easily calculate total repo size from project statistics table we can simple do the calculation and display it in the admin UI.\n\nWe may want to give some headroom so perhaps calculating `0.5 * repo size` and saying \"your cluster should be at least this big\" will be a good way to convey the information.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

We'll still need to actually implement sorting on the release page.\n\nIf a release page is paginated with a large number of releases, we'll need to be sure to address pagination while sorting. For instance, if sorting by `create_at` from oldest to newest, we'll need to take the last item from the last pagination page and display it as the first item on the first page. This can change dynamically as the user tries different sort options. However, since a sorted list of releases will be returned from the backend API, that should greatly reduce the amount of frontend logic that will need to be implemented.\n\nRight now we only have two date types in a release `created_at` and `released_at`.\n\n#### Estimation\n\n**Total MRs:** `1`\n\n* Frontend MR to make a request to the server to get releases in a sort order, additionally enabling sorting for release pages that are paginated, once the API is created on the backend.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [x] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

For example, it's confusing if a job succeeds even though there are vulnerabilities found within. See the video of the research readout [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xKIKUP0YYsPWSzNKCLFD9OQRXp-9A8Ef) and the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qZ2Vdeua9L8iJCAqj2G4uhkl5LNKC-9prUhamcALS0Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis issue split from #204176 and #216140 to colorize text shown in the mockup below.\n\n![image](/uploads/517000fd1266ae28d524f5d04a1e68ae/image.png)\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe current way we generate the report text is a bit cumbersome and any changes to it would be tricky.\nWe're probably better off rewriting it using [`\u003cgl-sprintf /\u003e`]() and some nicer logic.\n\nThe text in the screenshot reads: `Security scanning found 2 critical and 1 high severity vulnerabilities out of 162`.\nWe'd need to catch all the other cases though.\n\n(note small text update to include `new` before each count # per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216140#note_371116562)\n\n### Documentation\n\nTBD\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThe unit tests for the text generator will need updating and/or any other tests that rely on them working.\nDon't just delete them and write new ones as this will help us ensure we've caught all the edge cases.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSuccess looks like the screenshot without any issues with edge cases.\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n- [x] Add `summary` slot to [`summary_row.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.0.6-ee/app/assets/javascripts/reports/components/summary_row.vue) that defaults to the existing `summary` prop\n- [x] Add `success-text`, `loading-text` and `error-text` slots to `ReportSection` component\n    - It turns out this already exists!\n- [x] Update the `grouped*Text` getters (or the underlying `groupedTextBuilder`) to add placeholders for the different severities, (e.g., `%{criticalStart/End}` for use by `GlSprintf`\n- [x] Use new `summary` slot in [`grouped_security_reports_app.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.0.6-ee/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/security_reports/grouped_security_reports_app.vue) for each report type, passing the results of the `grouped*Text` getters into `GlSprintf`.\n- [x] Add `new` after each count # as follow up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216140#note_371116562","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-10T15:07:56.358Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T17:14:30.764Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T10:03:15.370Z","closed_by":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Category:Vulnerability Management","Stretch","UI text","devops::secure","frontend","group::static analysis","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"}],"author":{"id":5329074,"username":"tmccaslin","name":"Taylor McCaslin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5329074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmccaslin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221084","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221084","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221084/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221084/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#221084","relative":"#221084","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#221084"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3246,"epic":{"id":51772,"iid":3246,"title":"Simplify \u0026 Cleanup","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3246","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":40921628,"iid":221080,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo Node Status -

Loading YAML a file safely: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/concerns/insights_feature.rb#L43\n\n- Create a model/service class where we can store the path to the YAML file and a method where we load the file.\n- Create a finder method that returns the series definition.\n\nProposed API:\n\n```ruby\n# sketch\nmodule Analytics\n  module Reports\n    class ConfigLoader\n      GITLAB_PROVIDED_REPORT_CONFIG = 'report_pages/default.yml'\n\n      def find_report_by_id(report_id)\n        # lookup in the loaded hash\n        # returns the complete report hash\n      end\n\n      def find_series_by_id(report_id, series_id)\n        # lookup in the loaded hash\n        # returns the series hash, raises a custom error when we couldn't find the item\n      end\n\n      private\n      \n      def load_internal_report_config\n        # returns hash, content of the YAML file\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-10T14:49:08.123Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T14:07:04.821Z","closed_at":"2020-09-08T14:07:04.778Z","closed_by":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::optimize","missed:13.2","section::dev","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Filter projects by joining the `authorized_projects` table.\n2. Filter project attributes with a wildcard query.\n3. Order the result.

This means adding extra calculations and ordering might not affect the performance that much.\n\nNotice the `Filter` when scanning the `index_projects_on_namespace_id_and_id` index: [Query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/kneW)\n\n### Sorting by name\n\nWhen a user searches for a particular project (sorting by name or other column), often results in unexpected search results.\n\n**Example:** Search for `gitlab` in the `gitlab-org` projects.

The project contains the `gitlab` string in the description and the padlock makes it the first element when sorting alphabetically.\n\n### Scoring\n\nWe can get better results if we try to score the results based on how closely the search text matches the record.\n\nScoring rules (needs tweaking):\n\n- Exact match in project name: 300\n- Exact match in project path: 300\n- Exact case insensitive match in project name: 150\n- Partial case insensitive match (starts with) in project name: 100\n- Partial case insensitive match (starts with) in project path: 100\n- Project case insensitive path contains the search string: 50\n- Project case insensitive description contains the search string: 10\n- Note: For the partial matches, take into account the match size.\n\nSumming the values would give us the score. If we order the results by score, we'll get more relevant projects on top.\n\n**Example query when the user searches for `gitla`:**\n\n```sql\nselect name, path, ((CASE WHEN \"projects\".\"name\"='gitla' THEN 300 ELSE 0 END) +\n(CASE WHEN \"projects\".\"path\"='gitla' THEN 300 ELSE 0 END) +\n(CASE WHEN LOWER(\"projects\".\"name\")=LOWER('gitla') THEN 150 ELSE 0 END) +\n(CASE WHEN strpos(LOWER(\"projects\".\"name\"), LOWER('gitla')) = 1 THEN 100 - ABS(LENGTH('gitla') - LENGTH(\"projects\".\"name\")) ELSE 0 END) +\n(CASE WHEN strpos(LOWER(\"projects\".\"path\"), LOWER('gitla')) = 1 THEN 100 - ABS(LENGTH('gitla') - LENGTH(\"projects\".\"path\")) ELSE 0 END) +\n(CASE WHEN strpos(LOWER(\"projects\".\"name\"), LOWER('gitla')) != 1 AND strpos(LOWER(\"projects\".\"name\"), LOWER('gitla')) != 0 THEN 50 - ABS(LENGTH('gitla') - LENGTH(\"projects\".\"name\")) ELSE 0 END) +\n(CASE WHEN strpos(LOWER(\"projects\".\"description\"),

Scoring is adds a slight overhead.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nNote: Using elasticsearch would be better tool for the job, however at the moment elasticsearch is not 100% available within GitLab. \n\n\n- Introduce a new sorting option to the project search API: `relevance` (defaults to `DESC` order).\n- When the `relevance` sort option is given, add the scoring calculation to the query.\n- If no search text is given, fall back to order by name (`ASC`).\n- Mark the `relevance` sort option as experimental or interrnal for now in the docs.\n\n\n### Related issues\n\n-

set in [profile preferences](https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences) after the upgrade, This might have introduced in an earlier version as well. After investigation, Found out that, language is not actually set in the DB, It's only the UI which shows as a default option. This could cause issues if the user changed any other preferences and click save button without noticing the default language option. This issue is visible on gitlab.com as well. This happens when `preferred_language` is set to NULL.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Login to GitLab.com\n- Navigate to [profile pref](https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences)\n- Navigate to Localization\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-06-10_13-56-07](/uploads/ebc99b47cdba8f3f6429c5f09674e83e/Screenshot_from_2020-06-10_13-56-07.png)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitLab users have `bulgarian` language as a default option in [profile preferences](https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThis should either have been empty or set to English so that visiting profile prefs (doing nothing) and click save button should not change the `preferred_language` in DB.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-06-10_13-56-07](/uploads/ebc99b47cdba8f3f6429c5f09674e83e/Screenshot_from_2020-06-10_13-56-07.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Preferred solution\n\n* Leave `English` in its current place on the list.\n* Default the UI to `English` (visually) when language is not set in the DB (`NULL`). (Otherwise, show the actually selected language - current behavior)\n* Saving the user preferences would either save `English`, or leave `NULL` - same effect.\n* New users would continue to be created with `NULL` default for their language preference.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-10T09:06:27.783Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:17:28.410Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T15:20:35.015Z","closed_by":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},"labels":["Category:Internationalization","Deliverable","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","milestone::p2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"}],"author":{"id":382126,"username":"savitojs","name":"Savitoj Singh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8048a5ffb29b371e905bbacc00433b1d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/savitojs"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221037","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221037","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221037/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/221037/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#221037","relative":"#221037","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#221037"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2722,"epic":{"id":23515,"iid":2722,"title":"Category:Internationalization Strategy","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2722","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":40058935,"iid":221029,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move states definition from Geo::PackageFileRegistry to some basic class","description":"All the state machine definition from `Geo::PackageFileRegistry` can be moved to some basic class.
