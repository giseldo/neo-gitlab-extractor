exports","description":"### Summary\n\nAs described in [this original issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284498), creating a new project from a group-level project template on gitlab.com sometimes fails with \n- `The repository could not be imported.`\n- `Import timed out. Import took longer than 54000 seconds`\n\nTo significantly reduce the chance of this bug happening, we should create a separate sidekiq queue just for the project template exports.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a new project from a group template.\n\nPer [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284498#note_450304300), the exact flow is as follows:\n\n1. New project using custom template is requested\n1. Blank project is then created with `project.import_state = scheduled` -- in order to show 'Import in Progress' screen on the frontend\n1. Since this is a project from template, a new export job is queued for the template http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/services/ee/projects/gitlab_projects_import_service.rb#L13-13\n1. Export of a template is executed in 10 minutes\n1. While that was happening StuckImportJob ran, found project with import state scheduled but without a jid and marked it as failed, regardless of what timeouts we have\n1. After export completed, an import was queued http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/import_export/after_export_strategies/custom_template_export_import_strategy.rb#L30-30\n1. Lastly, the actual import failed to start with import state was marked as failed http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/workers/repository_import_worker.rb#L46-46\n\n### Example Project\n\nSubgroup: https://gitlab.com/edmond-demo/gitlab-days\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFails with \n- `The repository could not be imported.`\n- `Import timed out. Import took longer than 54000 seconds`\n\n![image](/uploads/73e46b9c965bb44a403cbdc89e2597ef/image.png)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNew project created based on the group template.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nPer [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284498#note_450304300), these are some of the steps we can take to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Create a new sidekiq queue just for project template export work which ensures that regular project exports do not interfere. This does not solve a race condition, but reduces the changes of it happening**\n2. _Investigate ways of not marking such project as failed, when its state is 'scheduled' and no jid is present. Perhaps we should look at the timeout setting and skip such projects until project is older than `IMPORT_JOBS_EXPIRATION`_\n3. _Somewhat related, we should see if we can make ProjectExportWorker idempotent with deduplication strategy in place, in order to remove duplicate jobs from the queue if a similar job is currently running. I can imagine a situation where a user enqueues a big project export more than once, if export is not completed within a reasonable amount of time (at least that's what I would do, if I get no progress updates after some time). Such scenario is a waste of resources which can delay other jobs._\n\n### Proposed fix\n\nIn this issue, we will implement suggestion 1. from the section above (in **bold**):\n\nCreate a separate sidekiq queue just for the project template exports, which would ensure that regular project exports do not impact new projects being created from a template. Note that this does not solve the race condition, but reduces the changes of it happening.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-19T01:04:21.297Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T01:22:32.105Z","closed_at":"2020-12-01T12:14:29.095Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Next Up","Unplanned","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","milestone::p1","section::dev","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285054","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/285054","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/285054/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/285054/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#285054","relative":"#285054","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#285054"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3496,"epic":{"id":62382,"iid":3496,"title":"🐞 Template bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3496","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e3\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74592709,"iid":285020,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support urls for Postman and HAR files in API Fuzzing","description":"### Problem\n\nUsers of API Fuzzing can provide HAR and Postman files to perform testing.

If that's true, then initial backfill in Geo will take a very long time for GitLab versions that deduplicate jobs by default.\n\nI think Reenqueuer is idempotent, but it is not necessarily droppable. Should we remove the `idempotent!` from Reenqueuer?\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Problem\n\nAutomatic job deduplication was added for `idempotent!` jobs at some point. It appears to interact with Reenqueuer logic so that when Reenqueuer calls `perform_async`, it doesn't actually schedule a job.\n\nRegarding severity:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nBy chance, RegistryConsistencyWorker batch size was set to 10k for unrelated reasons a while back, so for many customers, the backfill rate with this bug would probably be acceptable. E.g. 6M records would be created in 6M rows / 10k rows per min / 60 min per hour =\u003e 10 hours, which seems well within the same order of magnitude of the time it would take sync job schedulers to run sync jobs (e.g. sync a project repo) for each record anyway.\n\nSo the problem, if it exists, may not be overly severe.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nNote, I was unable to reproduce this problem locally: `RegistryConsistencyWorker` reenqueued itself when `perform` returned `true`. But I think it's worth disabling deduplication for `Reenqueuer` to be sure this works, and not by coincidence.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd `deduplicate :none` to Reenqueuer and add tests to the `reenqueuer_shared_examples` to ensure this for all usages.\n\n### To do\n\n- [ ] Smoke test to verify this problem and then the fix\n- [x] Check if this affects `LimitedCapacity::Worker` in some way as well (maybe not since it uses `bulk_perform_async`)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-18T17:45:26.942Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:03:52.957Z","closed_at":"2020-12-07T21:38:35.131Z","closed_by":{"id":4554077,"username":"nhxnguyen","name":"Nick Nguyen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554077/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nhxnguyen"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","devops::systems","group::geo","maintenance::refactor","section::enablement","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284826","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":1},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284826","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284826/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284826/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284826","relative":"#284826","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284826"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74582358,"iid":284825,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove Suggested Approver","description":"The following discussion from !47475 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @pedroms started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47475#note_448349488):  (+3 comments)\n\n    \u003e I'm glad you bring that up, because last time I checked, that “Suggested approvers…” feature doesn't do anything if you click on people's names.

versions of the analyzers I maintain when a patch release is available for Go.\n\nAs a developer contributing to these projects, I need to know what version of Go was used to build a given Docker image of given analyzer.\n\n### Intended users\n\nThis is intended to project maintainers of the ~\"devops::secure\" analyzer projects implemented in Go, that is ~\"group::composition analysis\" and ~\"group::static analysis\". The solution can also be adopted by ~\"devops::protect\", to ease the maintenance of ~\"Category:Container Scanning\".\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposal can be summarized by 3 key points:\n- change the `Dockerfile` to track the minor version of Go\n- use BUILD tag to release a new Docker image that comes with a patch version of Go\n- don't specify the patch version of Go in the codebase or in the changelog\n- report the exact version of Go in the log of the build log\n\nWhen aware of new patch version of Go, project maintainers check the analyzer projects to see if it needs to be re-built and re-published (or they might simply skip that). If this is the case, they create a new git tag with the same `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version, but a different `+BUILD` tag. For instance, if the last git tag is `v3.4.5`, they create a new git tag `v3.4.5-1`. This will trigger a new build, and publish the image as `3.4.5-1` and `3`.\n\nThe exact version of Go isn't in the project CHANGELOG because it wouldn't be accurate, because a new patch version of Go can be released at any time.\n\nCreating a new git tag with a different BUILD metadata truly reflects what happens: the Docker image is re-built. Also, this is consistent with the CHANGELOG (no new changelog entry), and has the side-effect of triggering a full pipeline that pushes the images used in production, which is needed.\n\nAnalyzer projects might accidentally upgrade to a new patch version of Go when pushing new features or bug fixes. This is intended, as we assume that latest patch versions of Go are 100% backward compatible. If that's not the case then QA will fail, which is OK.\n\nThe Docker build argument `GO_VERSION` can remain because it provides an easy way to try out specific versions of Go. This is useful when checking compatibility with a new MINOR version, or when we have to rollback the implicit upgrade and figure out what was the last compatible PATCH version.\n\nThe `GO_VERSION` is removed from the shared CI template, and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/135 is reverted.\n\nThe upgrade to a new MINOR version of Go has to be handled manually or using scripts that bulk update all the analyzer project. In the future, we might create a CI job that automatically creates MRs to do that, similar to the `update_analyzers` job of the [common library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common).\n\nPros:\n- releasing a new version of the analyzer for a patch version of is really easy, and it takes very little time\n- active analyzer projects automatically upgrade to new patch versions of Go, as MRs get merged\n- the code tells what minor version of Go is used\n- the Dockerfile truly reflects the build of the official Docker image\n\nCons:\n- the code doesn't directly say what patch version of Go was used at a particular time, though it's possible to jump from the git tag to the pipeline, and find the information in the `log` of the build job\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] make sure all ~\"devops::secure\" analyzer projects using Go are aligned with this, and that they use Go 1.15 in their multi-stage Dockerfiles\n- [x] update the [Secure Release Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure/release_process.html) documentation, and repeat the key points of the [proposal](#proposal); this my be ported to the Protect section of the handbook https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/71760\n- ~~update the Dockerfiles of analyzer projects so that version of Go shows up when building the binary; ideally, we'll figure out a way to do that without repeating the same change in all projects~~ covered by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292228\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change.\n\n### Documentation\n\nTo be documented in the [Secure Release Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure/release_process.html):\n- applies to all ~\"devops::secure\" analyzers implemented in Go\n- multi-stage Dockerfile tracks a major version of Go (i.e. 1.15)\n- CHANGELOG doesn't mention the minor revision of Go (i.e. 1.15.4)\n- project is upgraded implicitly to the latest minor revision\n- backward compatibility with earlier minor revisions is assumed\n- if upgrade is needed but there's nothing to release, maintainers create a git tag that matches the last version of the CHANGELOG, but with a different build metadata; see [SemVer](https://semver.org/); a new version of the analyzer is released\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis wouldn't be covered by QA but could be tested on a clone of an official analyzers project.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nProject maintainers of the Secure analyzers implemented in Go can quickly publish and deploy a patch release for the analyzers as soon as they're aware of a patch release of Go.\n\nDevelopers contributing to these projects can easily figure out what version of Go what used to build a particular image of the Secure analyzers.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nN/A\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes. This is primarily for ~\"devops::secure\" but it's applicable to ~\"devops::protect\".\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/277401","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-18T10:20:14.436Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:48:03.058Z","closed_at":"2021-01-19T19:12:10.134Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:SAST","Category:Secret Detection","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::pipelines","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284643","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284643","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284643/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284643/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284643","relative":"#284643","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284643"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3276,"epic":{"id":52489,"iid":3276,"title":"Technical work - backstage - Secure Composition Analysis","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3276","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":74549189,"iid":284637,"project_id":278964,"title":"Define and describe metrics retiring process","description":"## Background\n\nRecently there were two issues raised that was aimed to remove already existing keys in usage ping payload.

even if your format is not yet supported. For example, many of you are using the generic package format as a workaround for your Linux packages. \n\nThe problem is that you cannot use a deploy token when using generic packages. This is inconsistent with the rest of the Packages feature which supports publishing and installing packages with a deploy token. As a workaround you can your personal access token, but this is not ideal, especially at larger organizations. \n\nMoving forward, you can use your deploy token when interacting with generic packages. We hope this new workflow will help you to be more efficient and secure. \n\n### Problem to solve \nWhen publishing and installing generic packages, you can't use a project or group deploy token. This is problematic for organizations that prefer to avoid using a personal access token in their pipelines. It's also incongruent with the other package manager formats supported by GitLab Packages. \n\n### Proposal \nAdd support for authenticating with a project or group deploy token when publishing, installing, or viewing generic packages. \n\n### Documentation\n- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/generic_packages/index.html#authenticate-to-the-package-registry","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-17T21:44:26.833Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T09:07:42.733Z","closed_at":"2021-01-22T17:11:48.892Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Community contribution","Generic Package Repository","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::package","feature::enhancement","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":23,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284397","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284397","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284397/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284397/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284397","relative":"#284397","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284397"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4209,"epic":{"id":94932,"iid":4209,"title":"Provide Generic Package Repository","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4209","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74529324,"iid":284396,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove Issues::CreateFromVulnerabilityService code","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nWe are changing the workflow for issue creation from vulnerabilities.

These irrelevant projects showing up make it harder to see meaningful data in the group repository analytics page.\n\n### Summary\n\nOn the group repositories analytics page, we have a section labeled \"Latest test coverage results\". There is a projects dropdown that allows you to select the projects you want to view in the table. If you select `All projects` in the dropdown, sometimes the table doesn't actually show all the projects in the group that have coverage data.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to a group that has more than 100 projects (e.g. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org)\n1. Go to the group's repositories analytics page (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/repository_analytics)\n1. In the projects dropdown in the \"Latest test coverage results\" section, click `All projects`\n1. Note that not all projects in the group show in the table\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly some of the group projects are showing up in the table.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll of the group projects that have coverage should show up in the table.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_1.13.11_PM](/uploads/d088e9f9c8af282cf9e7a2a59ce05a96/Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_1.13.11_PM.png)\n\nNote that all projects are selected, but the table doesn't show `GitLab` or `gitlab-runner` projects.\n\n## Proposal\n1. Run a migration to add a `namespace_id` foreign key to `daily_build_group_report_results`.\n1. Re-tool the GraphQL query (~frontend) \u0026 resolver (~backend) to do something like:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  group(fullPath: \"gitlab-org\") {\n      projects(hasCodeCoverage: true, ids: [\"gid://gitlab/Project/1\"] #nil will default to all projects) {\n      nodes {\n        id\n        name\n          codeCoverageSummary {\n          averageCoverage\n          coverageCount\n          lastUpdatedOn\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Other Possible fixes\n\nWe are trying to fetch all of the projects at once, but we are limited by the top 100 projects in the group. We need to implement two things in the GraphQL API:\n\n- Add the ability to search by project ID in the group.projects query. We should be able to do the following:\n\n```\nquery getGroupProjects($fullPath: String!, $projectIds: [ID!]) {\n  group(fullPath: $fullPath) {\n    projects(ids: $projectIds, first: 100) {\n      nodes {\n        fullPath\n        id\n        name\n        codeCoverageSummary {\n          averageCoverage\n          coverageCount\n          lastUpdatedOn\n        }\n      }\n      pageInfo {\n        endCursor\n        hasNextPage\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Add the ability to filter out the projects that don't have coverage since they don't show up in the table. We should be able to do the following:\n\n```\nquery getGroupProjects($fullPath: String!, $projectIds: [ID!]) {\n  group(fullPath: $fullPath) {\n    projects(ids: $projectIds, hasCodeCoverage: true, first: 100) {\n      nodes {\n        fullPath\n        id\n        name\n        codeCoverageSummary {\n          averageCoverage\n          coverageCount\n          lastUpdatedOn\n        }\n      }\n      pageInfo {\n        endCursor\n        hasNextPage\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe also need to change the frontend to use these two API changes to request all projects.\n\n### Documentation updates\n* Add to the [feature documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/repositories_analytics/) that only projects that have a parsed coverage value will be available on the page.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-17T20:06:46.728Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T14:17:29.690Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T16:01:10.207Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","GitLab Premium","Stretch","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline insights","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"}],"author":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284381","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284381","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284381/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284381/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284381","relative":"#284381","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284381"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2838,"epic":{"id":28788,"iid":2838,"title":"Code Coverage Data for groups","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2838","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":74525701,"iid":284376,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update frontend to use new call to build an issue from a vulnerability","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nThe workflow proposed in #250353 requires a change to the route called when building an issue from a vulnerability.

The current affordance that the user has available is we are highlighting the first item in the dropdown (which shows this scope), but it can be easily unnoticed. Additionally, that menu takes a bit of time to appear, so if they type their search and immediately submit, they may not even notice the search is being scoped.\n\nThis came up as a experience improvement recommendation in both a competitive evaluation (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/competitor-evaluations/-/issues/5#insights-with-issue-links) as well as on a recent UX Scorecard (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/1679).\n\ncustomer feedback:\nhttps://hello.chorus.ai/listen?guid=d0dd0ef7332f4bfe808ae8631362d44c\n\n### Proposal\n\nDisplay a more clear indication that we are scoping these searches (with the ability to change scope), while not relying on the dropdown menu to provide this indication.\n\n### Further details\n\n_current experience_\n\n| group | project |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_9.17.08_AM](/uploads/75e507b7b078cd53e4cbc226009b02ce/Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_9.17.08_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_9.17.26_AM](/uploads/f33cc3da664b4269a4a9ec0e86c0cfc7/Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_9.17.26_AM.png) |\n\n### Solution\nWhen searches from the top navbar will be scoped to a specific **group** or **project**, disclose this information as a [token](https://design.gitlab.com/components/token) within the search field on focus.\n\nWe will also still offer the ability to expand that scope (either the parent group or all of GitLab) with the first option(s) within the dropdown as the user begins typing.\n\nSince on screen sizes less than 992px there is no search bar present, and by tapping the search icon the user is taken to the global search page, we do not need to solve for mobile sizes with this first iteration. It may make sense to modify this current behavior in the future to allow searching from where the user is at on smaller screens (\u003c992px)without first needing to be taken to the global search page.\n\nWe will want to ensure there is a max-width for the search bar on focus for extra large screens (currently I have this shown at 640px max in the 1600 screen size design below).\n\n- [x] Show/hide scope as token when option is available (currently once `2` characters are entered)\n- [x] ~~Since we are showing the default scope (the current first scope option that is auto-focused) as a token, we can remove this as an option in the dropdown.~~ The direction for this has been changed, we will continue to show the default scope as the first option in the dropdown even with it being also displayed as a token in the search field itself.\n  - ~~When a user arrows down :arrow_down: when scopes options are shown, the first option in the dropdown will be selected/focused (which would be either a subgroup, group, or \"all of GitLab\".~~\n  - Arrowing down will work as it did prior to this update. The default scope will be shown first in the dropdown and highlighted, and arrowing down will move to the next option in the dropdown.\n- [x] Update the other scope options in the dropdown to use a token to display their scope (as seen in the [design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284139/designs/992_-_focus_-_token_added.png))\n- [x] Hide scope when search field is out of focus (on blur)\n- [x] Update the max-width of the search field to `640px`\n- [x] Prefix scope token with what type it is ([Group](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~group), [Subgroup](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~subgroup), [Project](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~project))\n- [x] Truncate scope tokens at a set threshold (design shows `30` char). [See this design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284139/designs/truncation.png) for how we can use the title attribute to allow users to see the full scope name\n- [x] Ensure input text does not go below the token and is always visible, with horizontal scrolling when needed\n\n\n### Release Notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the customer symptom we are improving?

from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233898 and UX debt from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47726.\n\nAs explained in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233898#note_447253883, the `Show one file at a time` user preference exists in two places, but those are not in sync:\n1. User preferences page\n1. MR preferences menu\n\nChanging the preference in the MR menu will always override what is set in the user preferences page.\n\nIf it is a lot of work to keep them in sync, we can remove the user preference page setting and have just the MR preference setting in the dropdown menu. We already have user preferences that only live in the MR preference dropdown: file browser mode and comparison modes. At least this approach would be consistent with that.\n\n### Solution\n\nHaving ~backend create the API endpoint for this user preference and then on the MR having it use that API to actually toggle the preference. Maybe this is a good opportunity to introduce some more GraphQL as it's \"net-new\" API (maybe not).\n\nThis feature falls apart the moment someone tries to use a different computer, clears their cookies, opens in a new browser, etc. By leveraging an API to do this, we can provide a more consistent experience to users across these situations.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-17T14:31:50.018Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T19:59:53.926Z","closed_at":"2021-04-09T17:26:53.510Z","closed_by":{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","Technical Writing","UX debt","backend","backend-weight::2","devops::create","diff","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":142752,"username":"garyh","name":"Gary Holtz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/142752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/garyh"},{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"}],"author":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":142752,"username":"garyh","name":"Gary Holtz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/142752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/garyh"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284116","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284116","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284116/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284116/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284116","relative":"#284116","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284116"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":516,"epic":{"id":1789,"iid":516,"title":"📑 File-by-file merge request diff navigation MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/516","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74505714,"iid":284113,"project_id":278964,"title":"Cleanup invisible_captcha feature flag","description":"The `invisible_captcha` feature flag has been in use since 12.2.

Only 753 of those requests were after the job started; the rest were all while it was waiting to be picked up:\n\n```\n[ gprd ] production\u003e Ci::Build.find(845834636).created_at\n=\u003e Thu, 12 Nov 2020 14:52:53 UTC +00:00\n[ gprd ] production\u003e Ci::Build.find(845834636).started_at\n=\u003e Fri, 13 Nov 2020 16:34:39 UTC +00:00\n[ gprd ] production\u003e Ci::Build.find(845834636).finished_at\n=\u003e Fri, 13 Nov 2020 17:32:41 UTC +00:00\n[ gprd ] production\u003e Ci::Build.find(845834636).status\n=\u003e \"failed\"\n```\n\nIt's hard to estimate the precise impact of this because our logging does not include the job status at the time of polling, but we can see that the [most popular (trace endpoint, user, IP) combinations](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/d94ad2c503c984c35e8d681b14a0a68c) all follow this pattern: a job that takes a long time to be picked up, and presumably isn't in a foregrounded tab, because it seems unlikely that someone would foreground a tab of a job that's not even started yet :slight_smile: \n\nRemoving those top polling users would dramatically reduce the traffic to this endpoint and reduce the strain on Redis.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-17T13:31:24.506Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T13:43:29.745Z","closed_at":"2020-12-07T15:23:55.739Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","bug::availability","bug::performance","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","group::scalability","priority::3","section::ops","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"}],"author":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284103","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284103","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284103/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284103/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284103","relative":"#284103","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284103"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":74497828,"iid":284094,"project_id":278964,"title":"API fuzz -

The code pattern should be reused and abstracted as necessary.

Because Category Maturity Scorecards are a standardized process, moderators should complete and follow this testing script as closely as possible. The moderator will typically be a Product Designer, but this is not strictly required. You are encouraged to have any relevant stakeholders attend the sessions to help take notes, but it is very important they remain silent.\n\nThe 3 questions we ask\nWhen a participant is successful at completing a task, they are then asked 3 questions to help us measure their experience, which we then tie back to category maturity. Note that if a participant failed at completing a task, there’s no need to ask them the 3 questions.\n\nAt the root of how we rate/grade experiences, it arguably comes down to three main elements:\n\nHow easy it was to do something - this is defined as ease-of-use which has components of usability baked within it.\nHow the user rated that experience - given our user segments, they know what a user experience is - so we can ask about it. Understanding how users felt about that experience gives them the opportunity to rate it directly, rather than having us infer their rating based on calculations.\nCan the experience do what the user needs - this rates how well our experience matches our users' expectations based on their desired workflows and usage of similar tools.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-16T22:24:41.450Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T18:54:52.752Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T18:54:52.314Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["UX","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284002","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284002","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284002/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284002/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284002","relative":"#284002","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284002"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":74584985,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74462960,"iid":284001,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document success/failure flows for incident management CMS","description":"## This issue is for completing [Step 3](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/category-maturity-scorecards/#step-3-document-successfailure-flows-of-your-jtbd-scenarios) of the CMS process\n\nDefining ‘Success’\n\nSuccessful task completion.\nA single task may have several paths to the end goal that result in task completion, and thereby a ‘Success’. The team must identify the end goal prior to the study starting so everyone is aligned.\nWhy is this important? Identifying and being aligned on the end goal allows the moderator to accurately know what is success/failure, which is critical to know since follow-up questions are dependent on passing the task.\nDefining ‘Failure’\n\nUnable to complete the task.\nA partial completion of a task.\nWhen a participant is unable to complete a task, their ratings on the XYZ question are discarded.\nIf there is a failure, the team should try their best to understand why it occurred (ex: Was it the way the task was phrased? Was the experience confusing? etc.).\nHow can this be done? One way to do this is to go back at the end of the study to have the participant go through that task again. This time, you can ask targeted questions to understand why they took the route they took in the experience. (ex: ‘It looks like you clicked on ‘Issues’. Tell me more about why you selected that menu item.’, ‘You felt you completed the task at this point. What makes you feel confident that you have accomplished the goal of XYZ?’)\nHow the participant ended up at the end goal may not be important for the team to document. If the participant took the long path and felt it was or wasn’t easy, that should be reflected in their score. What matters most is if they ended up at the end goal.\n\nOnce you've gone through your scenario(s), have a co-worker complete the scenario as a pilot. Ideally, this person won't be familiar with the scenario, so they don't have an expert-level understanding of how it works. Use this pilot to uncover any issues with how you've formulated your scenario(s). As this is meant as a way to check your scenario/flow(s) plan, it's ok to coach your co-worker a little, using this discussion to get to the heart of any problems your scenario or flow may have. If any problems were found during this pilot run update your scenario flow(s) accordingly.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-16T22:21:31.863Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T18:53:59.226Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T18:53:58.987Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["UX","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284001","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284001","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284001/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/284001/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#284001","relative":"#284001","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#284001"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":74584902,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74462839,"iid":284000,"project_id":278964,"title":"Prepare testing environment","description":"## This issue is for completing Step 2 of the [CMS process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/category-maturity-scorecards/): Prepare testing environment\n\n**Step 2: Prepare your testing environment**\nTesting in a production environment is the best choice because your goal is to evaluate the actual product, not a prototype that may have a slightly different experience.\n\nOnce you know what scenario(s) you’ll put your participants through, it’s important to determine the interface you’ll use. Some questions to ask yourself:\n\nCan your participant use their own GitLab account? If not, can you set them up with a GitLab.com account and have them use that?\nDo you require a self-managed instance? If yes, do you need to provide one?\nDo your scenarios require any external actions? For example, do you need to display a specific alert, or can a participant complete everything on their own?\nDoes your scenario require interacting with anything besides a GitLab web-based interface? Should they receive an email or do they need to use a command-line interface?\nIt’s important to thoroughly plan how a participant will complete your scenario(s), especially if you answered \"yes\" to any of the questions above. Involve technical counterparts early in the process if you have any uncertainty about how to enable users to go through your desired flow(s).\n\nIf you want help creating a pristine test environment be sure to reach out to the Demo Systems group. They can create a demo environment for users and help build any particular parameters needed for your testing environment.\n\nIf your JTBD interacts with other stage groups’ areas, reach out to them to ensure their part of our product will support your scenario(s).\n\nBecause this is a summative evaluation of the current experience, all of the available options the participant should need access to must be available in the GitLab instance. When you recruit participants, keep in mind the tools and features they must access to complete the JTBD scenarios.\n\n## Testing environment plan\n\nWe will use the tanuki-ops environment. All participants will be added to the project and to the #tanuki-ops slack channel prior to testing. We will also trigger fresh alerts/incidents prior to each testing session.\n\nFor the alert scenario, we will trigger a core usage alert from the metrics dashboard. That will send an alert to #tanuki-ops. The slack notification will link to the alert that can then be triaged by the participant. Sample alert [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/ops/incident-setup/everyone/tanuki-inc/-/alert_management/290/details#/overview). \n\nFor the incident scenario, we will use the \"test alert\" functionality to trigger a Gitaly latency error. The incident will have the [Gitaly runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/gitaly/gitaly-latency.md) attached.

If you have multiple user types for your JTBD, it is ideal to recruit 5 from each user type. To keep the study manageable, focus on no more than 2 user types per study. If more than 2 user types are required to accurately measure your JTBD, conduct a separate follow-up study for the remaining user types.\n\nExample: A JTBD can be completed by a DevOps Engineer and a Release Manager. In this case, you’d recruit a total of 10 participants: 5 DevOps Engineers and 5 Release Managers.\n\nThe recruiting criteria can be based on an existing persona, but needs to be specific enough that it can be turned into a screener survey. A screener survey should then be created in Qualtrics that your prospective participants will fill out to help you determine if they're eligible to participate.\n\nThe template survey includes a question asking people if they consent to having their session recorded. Due to the analysis required for Category Maturity Scorecards, participants must answer yes to this question in order to participate. Once your screener survey is complete, open a Recruiting request issue in the UX Research project, and assign it to the relevant Research Coordinator. The Coordinator will review your screener, reach out to you if they have any issues, and begin recruiting users based on the timeline you give them.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-16T22:14:59.508Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T15:41:47.523Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T18:51:10.892Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["UX","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/283998","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283998","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283998/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283998/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#283998","relative":"#283998","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#283998"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":74584800,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74462641,"iid":283993,"project_id":278964,"title":"Choose JTBD to validate for the incident management category","description":"## Overview\n\nThis issue is for completing Step 0 of the [CMS process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/category-maturity-scorecards/). Details on Step 0 are as follows:\n\nBefore you move to Step 1, you'll first need to select a couple of high priority Job Statements that are relevant for your category features and translate them to script scenarios. Ideally, no more than 2 Job Statements should be tested per Category Maturity Scorecard study. The number of scenarios used per Job Statement often depends on the complexity of the features tested.\n\n- The Product Manager chooses up to 2 relevant high-priority Job Statements to focus on.\n- The Product Designer creates Scenarios to be used for the Category Maturity Scorecard study. If needed, PM + Product Designer can go through an intermediary step of breaking down broad Job Statements into feature-specific User Stories and use those as guidance when creating the study Scenarios.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### JTBD for CMS study\n\nBased on the results from our JTBD validation survey, the JTBD we'll validate are as follows:\n\n\"During an active incident, I want to reduce the time to resolution, so I can get things back up and running as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"When an alert is triggered, I want to be able to triage it quickly, so I can decide if it's worth investigating further or not.\"\n\n### Scenarios for CMS study\n\nBased on these two JTBD, our testing scenarios are as follows:\n\n**First scenario (for testing the alert JTBD):** \n\nImagine you work on the Operations team for online shoe retailer and you are responsible for maintaining the company's website. The holidays are coming up, and you are expecting higher than average traffic on your site. You are an operations engineer, and it's your job to make sure that any alerts impacting the availability of the site are fixed immediately. \n\nYou have just received an alert in Slack from GitLab indicating that something might be wrong. Please utilize GitLab to investigate this alert to see if it's something serious or not.\n\n**Second scenario (for testing the incident JTBD):** \n\nYou are still an Operations engineer for an online shoe retailer and you've been paged that there is a critical alert impacting site availability. An incident has already been declared for this alert. Please use GitLab to investigate the incident and to determine a path for resolution.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-16T22:09:00.173Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T17:21:42.310Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T17:26:19.823Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia

While there is no obvious reason why it shouldn't work in general with a Geo secondary, it appears that we rely on some queries that can't be run on a Standby Cluster. So in order to verify whether a node is \"healthy\" on secondary node, it needs to compare the status against the Follower Leader. We use latency for that, but how we retrieve should be different when querying against a Standby Leader.\n\nThis command can replicate the current problem:\n\n```ruby\nlb = Gitlab::Database::LoadBalancing::LoadBalancer.new(Gitlab::Database::LoadBalancing.hosts)\nlb.primary_write_location\n```\n\nThis will run the following :\n\n```ruby\nActiveRecord::Base.retrieve_connection.select_all(\"SELECT pg_current_wal_insert_lsn()::text AS location\").first\n```\n\nWhen running this in a Standby Leader, we should get the following error:\n\n```\nActiveRecord::StatementInvalid (PG::ObjectNotInPrerequisiteState: ERROR:  recovery is in progress)\nHINT:  WAL control functions cannot be executed during recovery.\n```\n\nWhen running it in a Primary PostgreSQL node, we get something like this as response instead:\n\n```\n=\u003e {\"location\"=\u003e\"0/800C4C28\"}\n```\n\nFor a Standby cluster we should probably rely on `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()` when querying the leader: \n\n```sql\nSELECT pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()::text AS location\n```\n\nRelated Documentation: \n* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION\n* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/warm-standby.html#CASCADING-REPLICATION\n\n\n----\n\n## Testing and rollout\n\nThe change will be [tested in Staging](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324656) using an ENV based feature flag: `USE_NEW_LOAD_BALANCER_QUERY`.

`extractors` \u0026 `loaders`. \n\ne.g.\n\n```ruby\nmodule BulkImports\n  module Groups\n    module Pipelines\n      class MyPipeline\n        include Pipeline\n\n        extractor Extractor\n

`BulkImports::Pipeline::Runner#run` has to loop through extractors/loaders, increasing it's complexity. In reality, so far (and it might change in the future), there is no need in having multiple extractors or loaders. Usually it's 1 loader and 1 extractor per pipeline. \n\n### Proposal \n\nRestrict defining extractors/loaders to 1 each per pipeline in order to reduce `BulkImports::Pipeline::Runner#run` complexity. If we are going to need to extract/load from/to multiple sources/destination we can revisit it and consider adding such functionality in the future, but there is no need in having it now.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-16T16:31:20.761Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T11:31:42.915Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T11:31:42.863Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Next Up","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/283945","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283945","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283945/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283945/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#283945","relative":"#283945","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#283945"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4931,"epic":{"id":145558,"iid":4931,"title":"GitLab Migration - Technical Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4931","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74442958,"iid":283938,"project_id":278964,"title":"Reset instance/group level integration","description":"### Problem\n\nCurrently, there is no way to deactivate an integration that is setup at the parent level.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

To achieve that, we use GraphQL with a query that specifies a very specific list of attributes to be included (e.g. get group query https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/bulk_imports/groups/graphql/get_group_query.rb). This approach is good, because executed query has a set number of fields, without anything extra. \n\nHowever, if GitLab source instance is mocked or spoofed, including GraphQL response, it might be possible to include extra data in the response, which might be included when persisting object in database. This can lead to unintended, harmful consequences. \n\n## Proposal \n\nBecause of the above risk, we need to clean any response data from extract from prohibited references, regardless if they were requested in our GraphQL query or not. \n\nThis can be achieved by creating a new transformer that deep traverses a hash and removes any occurrences of prohibited references.\n\nList of prohibited references: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/attribute_cleaner.rb#L14-21 \n\n## Other considerations\n\nSince this transformer is 'required' to be present in all pipelines, we need to make sure it's always present and try enforce its presence. This could be potentially achieved in a few different ways: \n\n1. Include newly created transformer in `BulkImports::Pipeline` so that it's always included when creating new pipeline\n2. Create a spec, which requires all pipelines in a set of specific directories and verifies that newly created transformer is present in `pipeline.transformers` list. This will prevent CI from being green until it's added.
