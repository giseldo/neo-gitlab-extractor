If one of these lookups fail (e.g. email was marked as private), this result is also cached. A failed lookup prevents user matching during import, but it can often be easily fixed by changing the email (visibility) and re-importing. However, due to these lookups being cached (for ~ a day), subsequent re-imports will still fail to match the user.\n\nTo avoid this, the user performing the import would have to wait for a day or find a way to clear the cache (which is not documented and not accessible for gitlab.com).\n\n### Proposed solution\nDepending on the performance impact, one of the following solutions should be implemented:\n1. Do not cache failed user lookups\n2. Retry the failed user lookups (at least once, up to x times)\n3. Clear the cache more often (at least the failed lookups in the cache)\n4. Allow the user to manually trigger clearing the cache\n\n#### Solution picked\n\n\u003e Clear the cache more often\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296706#note_677486127 for more details\n\n### Documentation\n*

from !50090: Use Vue components from Pajamas library","description":"The following discussion from !50090 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @cwoolley-gitlab started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50090#note_472612738):  (+5 comments)\n\n    \u003e **question:** Is there a reason we aren't using the [Pajamas progress bar component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/progress-bar/code) here?\n\n    @ekigbo:\n\n    \u003e I think it would be a bit a tricky to use a single component within a haml template and *probably* an anti-pattern, the preferred option would be to mount a vue app on a DOM node somewhere in the page and do all the vue/js stuff within vue components.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e \u003e I’m sure there’s some Vue bootstrapping step that is needed\n    \u003e \n    \u003e :100:, we need:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e * A DOM node in haml to mount the app\n    \u003e * a [page specific](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/performance.html#page-specific-javascript) `index.js` to instantiate Vue, preload data from the BE and setup any plugins\n    \u003e * A vue app with the logic we want, in this case, we could probably mount a vue app in the [_group.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50090/diffs#45a6fb8c5517fe9bbb60c53e27734f7cd652c90c_13_13) partial and remove this partial (moving the `show_trial_status_widget?(group)` check as well)\n    \u003e \n    \u003e But since this feature is currently an experiment, I think this would make sense as a follow-up improvement, perhaps once the experiment is complete? This haml template works, so i'm happy to move forward with it as an iteration.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-05T22:48:34.317Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T22:59:37.230Z","closed_at":"2021-01-21T23:22:48.731Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"labels":["devops::growth","group::acquisition","section::growth"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"}],"author":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296681","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296681","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296681/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296681/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296681","relative":"#296681","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296681"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76790888,"iid":296674,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `local_file_reviews`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:local_file_reviews` feature flag ...\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Code Review\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_code-review`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @thomasrandolph \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [x] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set

customizable timeouts for git CLI 2FA","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nCurrently, the OTP timeout for git CLI 2FA is hard-coded to 15 minutes, which doesn't allow for any customization.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps

Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nAfter OTP has been validated, the user has 15 minutes to use `git` commands that interact with the server (e.g. `clone`/`push`/`pull`) w/o requiring another OTP. After 15 minutes the user must request another OTP, which can be a problem for long-running processes, like automated builds.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe following use cases need to be covered:\n1. **MVC**: Provide `gitlab.rb` setting instead of hard-coded value so a system-wide default can be set\n1. Follow-on enhancement: Provide a UI to set system-wide default (UPDATE: We have decided to skip the MVC above and proceed directly with providing UI to set a system-wide default)\n1. Follow-on enhancement: Provide per-user customization of timeout\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature?

See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!-- Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.\nUse the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-05T19:23:37.574Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T15:28:48.054Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T06:24:04.018Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["2FA","GitLab Premium","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":3769593,"username":"kmcknight","name":"Ken McKnight","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3769593/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmcknight"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296669","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296669","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296669/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296669/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296669","relative":"#296669","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296669"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2889,"epic":{"id":31779,"iid":2889,"title":"2FA Support for CLI","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2889","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76783699,"iid":296667,"project_id":278964,"title":"Viewing a file and have a line selected, switching branch redirects to project's home page.","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile viewing a file, if one switches a branch while a line is selected (that is, there exist `#L\u003cn\u003e` in the URL in the address box), the page cannot find the file.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

There is a projects dropdown that allows you to select the projects you want to view in the table. If you select `All projects` in the dropdown, sometimes the table doesn't actually show all the projects in the group that have coverage data.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to a group that has more than 100 projects (e.g. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org)\n1. Go to the group's repositories analytics page (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/repository_analytics)\n1. In the projects dropdown in the \"Latest test coverage results\" section, click `All projects`\n1. Note that not all projects in the group show in the table\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly some of the group projects are showing up in the table.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll of the group projects that have coverage should show up in the table.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_1.13.11_PM](/uploads/5a4235719036330acb1cc7a366a593ea/Screen_Shot_2020-11-17_at_1.13.11_PM.png)\n\nNote that all projects are selected, but the table doesn't show `GitLab` or `gitlab-runner` projects.\n\n## Proposal\n\n```graphql\n{\n  group(fullPath: \"gitlab-org\") {\n      projects(hasCodeCoverage: true, ids: [\"gid://gitlab/Project/1\"]) {\n      nodes {\n        id\n        name\n          codeCoverageSummary {\n          averageCoverage\n          coverageCount\n          lastUpdatedOn\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Outcomes\n\n1. By adding a `namespace_id` to `DailyBuildGroupReportResult`, those records will become directly searchable by group, without joining to any other tables. This should decrease the query latency and also the total number of queries made. (Once coverage data is queried, the `projects` table can be joined for loading associated data)\n2. We will not return records without coverage data, because the presence of the `coverage` key is queryable on this table.\n\n### Other Possible fixes\n\nThis section is collapsed so it's historically preserved, but not part of the current implementation proposal.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nWe are trying to fetch all of the projects at once, but we are limited by the top 100 projects in the group. We need to implement two things in the GraphQL API:\n\n- Add the ability to search by project ID in the group.projects query. We should be able to do the following:\n\n```\nquery getGroupProjects($fullPath: String!, $projectIds: [ID!]) {\n  group(fullPath: $fullPath) {\n    projects(ids: $projectIds, first: 100) {\n      nodes {\n        fullPath\n        id\n        name\n        codeCoverageSummary {\n          averageCoverage\n          coverageCount\n          lastUpdatedOn\n        }\n      }\n      pageInfo {\n        endCursor\n        hasNextPage\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Add the ability to filter out the projects that don't have coverage since they don't show up in the table. We should be able to do the following:\n\n```\nquery getGroupProjects($fullPath: String!, $projectIds: [ID!]) {\n  group(fullPath: $fullPath) {\n    projects(ids: $projectIds, hasCodeCoverage: true, first: 100) {\n      nodes {\n        fullPath\n        id\n        name\n        codeCoverageSummary {\n          averageCoverage\n          coverageCount\n          lastUpdatedOn\n        }\n      }\n      pageInfo {\n        endCursor\n        hasNextPage\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe also need to change the frontend to use these two API changes to request all projects.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Documentation updates\n* Add to the [feature documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/repositories_analytics/) that only projects that have a parsed coverage value will be available on the page.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-05T18:13:57.958Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T18:45:34.124Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T15:42:05.330Z","closed_by":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","GitLab Premium","Stretch","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296665","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296665","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296665/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296665/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296665","relative":"#296665","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296665"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2838,"epic":{"id":28788,"iid":2838,"title":"Code Coverage Data for groups","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2838","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":76781622,"iid":296662,"project_id":278964,"title":"Revisit `minmax(0, 1fr)` on parent with setting `min-width` on child","description":"## Description\n\nOver in [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50715#note_478023261), we fixed an issue with overflowing containers due to some [quirky behavior with `css-grid`](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1777).\n\nThe proposed fix was to replace our `1fr` usage with `minmax(0, 1fr)`.

This is incorrect, as the group description does not (necessarily) accurately describe the project.\n\n### Proposed solution\nIf a Bitbucket project's description is blank, the imported GitLab's

This is a major contributor to slowness on `gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com` and `gitlab-org/gitlab`.\n\n### The Problem\n\nAs discovered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222247, [environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/environments) are persisted as refs in the pool repository. Certain `git` commands tend to read every single ref, so with a few thousand stale environment refs in the repository a lot of commands slow down dramatically.\n\nThis is a summary of directories being accessed when performing `git log` on a copy of the `www-gitlab-com` pool repository from a couple of months back. This copy was grabbed from production by @stanhu which we then loaded onto a test server, and a trace was then gathered of `git log` using the following command:\n\n```\nstrace -fttTyyy -s 1024 -o

`refs/remotes/origin/environments` directory. ~2.8 seconds are spent in `refs/remotes/origin/environments/production` (basically all in `refs/remotes/origin/environments/production/deployments`) and the rest is predominantly in `review-*` environments.\n\nIf we look at the environment dashboard we can see some current numbers for `www-gitlab-com`:\n\n![image](/uploads/70d6a26b60eebedf665f21b5f0db39f5/image.png)\n\nThe number of active review apps seems quite high to me relative to the number of open MRs (currently 1193), but the 10095 stopped environments are the major concern, and the vast majority are stopped review app environments.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nI have a few suggestions but I'm not overly familiar with the background for the environments system.\n\n1. Turn off auto-creation of review apps on problematic repositories and clean up all the stale environments\n2. Prune \"stopped\" environments far more aggressively, or start doing it if we're not already doing so, either in general or specifically for review apps\n3. Make the pruning of \"stopped\" environments something configurable per project, if it isn't already\n\nI'm open to other ideas and options we can explore for this.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-05T11:49:33.487Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T10:26:47.835Z","closed_at":"2021-08-05T02:51:01.612Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","automation:ml","automation:ml wrong","backend","backend-weight::2","bug::performance","cicd::planning","devops::create","environments","group::release","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","missed:13.9","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},{"id":2167502,"username":"robotmay_gitlab","name":"Robert May","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2167502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/robotmay_gitlab"}],"author":{"id":2167502,"username":"robotmay_gitlab","name":"Robert May","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2167502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/robotmay_gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":41,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296625","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296625","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296625/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296625/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296625","relative":"#296625","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296625"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76750763,"iid":296621,"project_id":278964,"title":"User popovers don't trigger after expanding a collapsed thread","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nWhen you expand a collapsed thread, the user popovers won't show up on hover.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a PM/engineer in the release stage, I want to know if our new Release CLI functionality is being used and how we can drive more awareness to get more users to adopt it.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Some of the main pain points are:\n\n- Yaml syntax is complex and new to those unfamiliar with GitLab CI/CD\n- CI/CD features are difficult to discover without reading through very lengthy documentation\n- Pipeline set-up is difficult to visualize without some type of chart\n\n#### Overall direction\n\nA visual (UI vs. YAML) pipeline builder would help us address the above problems, as well as provide a delightful experience for GitLab CI/CD users. According to UX research we've conducted, a visual pipeline builder would be the top attractive feature for GitLab CI/CD users.\n\nLong-term vision has been explored in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258970 and is being refined as we validate our ideas, one iteration at a time.\n\n## Implementation breakdown\n\nTo implement this feature, we are planning the following list of MRs. This will be done behind a disabled feature flag. It was agreed that this issue would be only for the drawer, and everything related to the template is now in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300501#note_566915187\n\n| Description | MR link |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| :white_check_mark: Implement the empty drawer in PA section | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60856  |\n| :white_check_mark: Add the drawer content | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60957 |\n| :white_check_mark: Remember collapse state in local storage | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61266 |\n| :white_check_mark: MR to enable by default | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61620 |\n| Rollout issue | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329806 |\n\n## MVC iteration proposal\n\nTo start addressing the above problems in an MVC way we want make all the existing CI/CD onboarding resources more accessible from the Pipeline Editor UI. \n\nA side drawer can contain information on the necessary onboarding steps, links to the docs and perhaps a simple pipeline visualization (static image) to provide an example of what a pipeline looks like.\n\n- The drawer should be added for all users\n- The drawer should be expanded by default, but once it's collapsed, we should remember that state, so next time the user opens the Pipeline Editor, the drawer will be collapsed.\n- The drawer should be embedded in the page and push the page content rather than overflow it (the same behavior as in the issue sidebar)\n- The basic CI/CD template proposal has been defined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300501#note_551181067 (the mockups have a placeholder template)\n\n| CI/CD onboarding MVC - guided walkthrough in the drawer | | \n| ------ |

your application faster by automating the execution of scripts.\n\u003e \n\u003e The pipeline stages and jobs are defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file which you can edit, visualize and validate using Pipeline Editor. \n\u003e \n\u003e **🚀 Run your first pipeline**\n\u003e \n\u003e A typical GitLab pipeline will consist of a Build, Test and Deploy stages with multiple jobs in each stage.\n\u003e \n\u003e In the example below, each stage contains one job with simple execution scripts. \n\u003e \n\u003e [pipeline illustration goes here]\n\u003e \n\u003e Commit and run this pipeline, then navigate to the [Pipeline Page](link to the pipeline page) to track the pipeline status.\n\u003e \n\u003e Note: If you’re using self-hosted GitLab instance, [make sure you have Runners available.](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)\n\u003e \n\u003e **💡 Tip: Visualize and validate your pipeline**\n\u003e \n\u003e Use the Visualize and Lint tabs of the Pipeline Editor to visualize your pipeline and check for any errors or warnings before committing your changes.\n\u003e \n\u003e **⚙️ Pipeline configuration reference**\n\u003e \n\u003e Resources to help with your CI/CD configuration:\n\u003e \n\u003e - Browse [CI/CD examples and templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/)\n\u003e - View [.gitlab-ci.yml syntax reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)\n\u003e - Learn more about [CI/CD practices](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/) \n\u003e - Make your pipeline more efficient with [Needs keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needs)\n\n## Further details\n\nThis issue is to capture the design exploration for the Pipeline Editor Visual Builder MVC based on the sketches and ideas explored in the [Pipeline Authoring team sketching exercise](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293696) as well as feedback received on

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Setup GitLab on a machine [with a non-UTC timezone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/timezone.html#changing-time-zone-in-omnibus-installations), such that `Date` objects in `gitlab-rails` produce non-UTC value formatting by default.\n2. Run some pipelines.\n3. Try to load project analytics CI/CD charts. They should appear with a flat 0-line.\n4. Go back to config and reset rails timezone to UTC, reconfigure.\n5. Load charts. They appear normal again.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n(Only affects self-managed installations with customized `time_zone` rails configs, as GitLab.com likely runs on a unified timezone (all-UTC)).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nCharts do not load for very specific self-managed deployments that use non-UTC default rails timezone.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nCharts should load regardless of rails timezone settings (behavior prior to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47069).\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\nSome additional information is available on a **premium** customer ticket (internal link: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/184955)\n\nAnother **starter** customer hitting the same issue: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/184819 (internal link)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\t\t\nProxy:\t\tno\nCurrent User:\tgit\nUsing RVM:\tno\nRuby Version:\t2.7.2p137\nGem Version:\t3.1.4\nBundler Version:2.1.4\nRake Version:\t13.0.1\nRedis Version:\t5.0.9\nGit Version:\t2.29.0\nSidekiq Version:5.2.9\nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:\t13.6.3-ee\nRevision:\t8578025c5e8\nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL\nDB Version:\t11.9\nURL:\t\thttp://localhost\nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://localhost/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@localhost:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:\tno\nGeo:\t\tno\nUsing LDAP:\tno\nUsing Omniauth:\tyes\nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:\t13.13.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

pages_update_legacy_storage feature flag on gitlab.com","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nDisable the `:pages_update_legacy_storage` feature flag ...\n\n**Note:** this change is partially irreversible. Once we stop updating legacy storage, it may become inconsistent, so it will be hard to re-enable it.\n\nWe don't serve from legacy storage for a few weeks already\n\nThere are only 2 project we even attempt to serve from legacy storage: https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/10fcf832114f9f6540daba72a16141f2, both of them failed to be deleted.\n\nAt the moment I don't know what else we should check.\n\n### I tested this on staging\n\n1. disabled legacy storage\n1. deployed pages\n1. removed pages\n1. redeployed pages\n1. renamed project\n1. moved project to another group\n1. finally removed project\n\nNo `DiskAccessDenied` were raised and pages were successfully viewed except for the case when I removed them.\n\nThe exception is being reported successfully though: https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/staginggitlabcom/issues/2582490/?environment=gstg, so I think tests on staging are successful\n\n\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Release\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#gitlab-pages`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @vshushlin\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can alse be useful to review --\u003e\n\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n- ...\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [ ] Confirm that QA tests pass with the feature flag enabled (if you're unsure how, contact the relevant [stable counterpart in the Quality department](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/#individual-contributors))\n- [ ] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [ ] Test on staging\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [ ] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [ ] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab pages_update_legacy_storage true\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-30T13:26:12.301Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T22:38:35.000Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T14:03:14.284Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir

See `200m`, `400m`, `600m` and `800m` in this screenshot:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-24_at_2.41.15_PM](/uploads/1af55bbc6e752665a693d0b6230476cb/Screen_Shot_2020-12-24_at_2.41.15_PM.png)\n\nIt is not clear what unit of measure `m` is. (It does not appear to be **Minutes** .) Could this be \"milliminutes\" (not really a measure of time accepted by [SI](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/))? \n\nFor projects where pipelines regularly last longer than one minute, this unit is not seen. The example screenshot for the [Duration for the last 30 commits](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/index.html#pipeline-success-and-duration-charts) is an example of this. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Create a project on GitLab.com\n1. Run pipelines in that project where the pipeline duration is less than one minute\n1. Browse to **Analytics** \u003e **CI/CD** for that project\n1. Observe that the **Duration for the last 30 commits** graph divides a single minute into numbers with a unit of measure `m`\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nI have replicated this in the [gitlab-gold/briecarranza/issues/value-of-m](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/briecarranza/issues/value-of-m/-/pipelines/charts) project. \n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nThe **Duration for the last 30 commits** graph divides 1 minute into an unclear unit of measure `m` where there are 1,000 `m` in 1 minute. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nIt would be nice to do one of the following:\n\n  - Clarify what unit of measure `m` is\n  - Use a more clear unit of measure when dividing a minute\n\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com (and on multiple self-managed instances). \n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed.

mutations allow Merge Request creator to bypass locked status","description":"**[HackerOne report #1063420](https://hackerone.com/reports/1063420)** by `jimeno` on 2020-12-21, assigned to @dcouture:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nHi GitLab,\n\nI\u0026#39;d like to report an Improper Access Control issue where attacker is able to perform state changing actions such as (un-)resolving discussion threads in Merge Requests after the repository owner locks the MR. The mutation used in this example is `discussionToggleResolve`.\n\n#####  Scenario setup\n\n1. Victim: create a public repository and add a dummy file to it  \n2. Attacker: fork the project and add a change to it  \n3. Attacker: submit a Merge Request  \n4. Any: add a comment so a discussion thread is generated  \n5. Victim: lock the Merge Request (notice the attacker isn\u0026#39;t able to (un-)resolve the existing discussions anymore)\n\n    ![setup_final_status.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/e137e52e-6430-45d9-8e67-44b5931499fe/setup_final_status.png)\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Attacker: notice you aren\u0026#39;t able to post new comments or resolve the discussion thread via the user interface\n\n    ![attacker_opens_locked_mr.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0a07629f-ae40-4722-bcf7-f441b9fc9590/attacker_opens_locked_mr.png)\n\n2. Attacker: run the following [GraphQL](https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer) query to find the ID of the discussion thread. Please, replace the repo and owner where needed\n\n    ```graphql  \n    {  \n      project(fullPath: \u0026#34;naaytesting/bugbountydemo\u0026#34;) {  \n        mergeRequests {  \n          edges {  \n            node {  \n              id  \n              title  \n              discussions {  \n                edges {  \n                  node {  \n                    id  \n                    resolvable  \n                    notes {  \n                      edges {  \n                        node {  \n                          body  \n                        }  \n                      }  \n                    }  \n                  }  \n                }  \n              }  \n            }  \n          }  \n        }  \n      }  \n    }      \n    ```\n\n3. Attacker: note the discussion ID. In my case it is `gid://gitlab/DiffDiscussion/da18f8200f0934b43fd1d1f62d5ea1a8dec2e1a8`. Notice its `resolvable` attribute is set to `true` while the UI shows the MR is completely locked and doesn\u0026#39;t allow to (un-)resolve it.  \n4. Run the following GraphQL query replacing the ID with yours.\n\n    ```graphql  \n    mutation test {  \n      discussionToggleResolve(input: {id: \u0026#34;gid://gitlab/DiffDiscussion/da18f8200f0934b43fd1d1f62d5ea1a8dec2e1a8\u0026#34;, resolve: true}) {  \n        errors  \n      }  \n    }  \n    ```\n\n5. Victim: refresh the MR and notice the attacker was able to perform activities against it and the discussion is resolved now.\n\n    ![attacker_activity_in_pr_after_locking.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1b941de1-dcc3-4154-9658-dbae8a256c71/attacker_activity_in_pr_after_locking.png)\n\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAttacker is able to do state-changing actions against a locked MR. In this particular case, (un-)resolve discussion threads.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nGitLab.com users can perform state-changing actions in their Merge Requests after the repository owners have locked them.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAttacker is able to do state-changing actions against a locked MR. In this particular case, (un-)resolve discussion threads.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAttacker isn\u0026#39;t able to do state-changing actions after the repo owner locks their MR.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nPlease, refer to each section.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\nN/A\n\n####  Impact\n\nAttacker is able to do state-changing actions against a locked MR. In this particular case, (un-)resolve discussion threads.\n\nIf this is the expected behavior, please let me know and I\u0026#39;ll be happy to self-close this report as N/A.\n\n##

instance","description":"It is critical for our self-managed users to upgrade to recent versions of GitLab. Simply put, because new versions contain:\n\n* Important security fixes, without which instances could be compromised\n* Product improvements and bug fixes, to improve user experience and productivity\n\n### Current state\n\nWe currently show whether an instance is up to date in two places:\n\n* Instance help page (`/help`), for example [gitlab.com/help](gitlab.com/help)\n* Instance settings main page, which requires admin access.\n\nIn both cases a small box appears with three states:\n\n* Green: up to date\n* Yellow: out of date\n* Red: missing critical security fixes\n\n### Proposal\n\nDue to the importance of self-managed administrators keeping their instances up to date, we should make this messaging more visible within our UI. We are also looking at automating updates (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15993), but that is likely a further out solution and users may opt-out.\n\nAs an MVC, we should target ensuring that instance administrators, the users who likely have the power to actually update the instance, are more informed of the update. Today, they have to visit either the help page, or the instance settings page. Neither of these are particularly high traffic.\n\nWe could do a few things:\n\n1. Add a notification indicator (similar to iOS/Android apps with pending notifications) on the wrench icon for accessing the instance settings menu. This is unobtrusive, but hard to resist :wink: \n1. Add a popup on login, dismissable, which informs the admin that a new feature has been released along with some general information. Ideally it would show an embedded or terse version of the release notes, but as an MVC letting users know whether they are out of date by a feature release or security release (similar to yellow/red indicators) could be useful.\n\n### Relevant research\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/800\n\n### Design\n\n- [Spec in Figma

inoperable group search Releases filter - backend","description":"This is the ~backend follow-up issue for disabling `release_tag` filtering on the backend for Groups.\nThe ~frontend MR is here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50010\n\nBelow is copy/pasted from the original issue, which now serves as the issue for just the frontend. However all of the same details apply so I copy/pasted it.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen accessing the group issue page, filtering by releases doesn't work. Items are returned, but they don't seem to be properly filtered by the release filter.\n\nSee also https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208805#note_394066335\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Navigate to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues\n- In the search box, select the \"Release\" filter\n- When selecting a release to filter by, search for `v12.4.0-ee`\n  - This is issue \u003cspan\u003e#\u003c/span\u003e1: this tag is real, but it doesn't show up in this list\n- Select any available release and press \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e\n  - This is issue \u003cspan\u003e#\u003c/span\u003e2: issues are returned, but it's not clear how they are related to the selected release\n\n### Example Project\n\nThe problem can be seen in [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5tmxGysCQOJ0IRfdH3KQn8RhK8SM27M/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n1. Not all releases are available in the filter dropdown when filtering by release\n1. After selecting a release, the results include items that shouldn't appear in the list\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe release filter should not be available at group search pages (for now).\n\nWe may revisit this feature after thinking through how it should behave: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243726\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nHide the releases filter on the group search pages. When we originally built this feature, we didn't think through how it should work on group pages (it was accidental that this filter showed up on both project and group pages). Because of this, simply removing the filter on group search pages would be consistent with our original vision for this feature.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-21T21:48:09.375Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T22:08:23.181Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T19:27:42.377Z","closed_by":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P3","[deprecated] low hanging fruit","backend","backend-weight::1","cicd::active","devops::release","group::release","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"}],"author":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/295253","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/295253","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/295253/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/295253/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#295253","relative":"#295253","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#295253"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76356679,"iid":295252,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `dast_saved_scans`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:dast_saved_scans` feature flag ...\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"devops::secure\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_secure-dynamic-analysis`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @philipcunningham @djadmin @pgascouvaillancourt \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

When the forked project is deleted, such MRs are closed and their source_project_id is set to nil (via ON DELETE SET NULL condition).\n\n\n**Non fork project:**\n\nFor a non-forked project, the source_project_id and target_project_id will be same as the project in which the MR is created.\nsource_project_id has the condition ON DELETE SET NULL and target_project_id has the condition ON DELETE CASCADE.\nWhen the project gets deleted, it could so happen that the source_project_id is first set to nil and then the cascade deletion happens and all records are deleted.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nRe-create the foreign key constraint for `source_project_id` to be positioned after `target_project_id`. This will ensure the projects are deleted before the updation of `nil` is triggered.\n\n**Note:** This solves only for non-forked project.

However, this does not appear to work, at least between GitHub Cloud and GitLab.com.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis case assumes all projects involved are private and that the project on GitLab.com has an ID of `23128347`\n\n1. Create a project on GitLab.com within a namespace on Bronze or higher.\n1. Create a project on GitHub Cloud.\n1. Using a PAT scoped to `api`, issue the following API call.\n\n```\ncurl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: TOKEN\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23128347/mirror/pull?import_url=https://git:TOKEN@github.com/tristan-jw/private-mirror.git\u0026mirror=true\"\n```\n\n4. Observe that the following error is returned.\n\n```\n{\"message\":\"The project is not mirrored\"}%\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\n[GitLab.com Project](https://gitlab.com/tristan/pull-mirror-api)\n[GitHub.com Project](https://github.com/tristan-jw/private-mirror)\n\nAccess to these private projects can be granted if needed.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen attempting to configure pull mirroring between a GitHub.com project and a GitLab.com one, an error is returned.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPull mirroring should be configured successfully between GitHub.com and GitLab.com when the appropriate API call is issued.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nHeader from the above API call:\n\n```\ndate: Thu, 17 Dec 2020 21:14:15 GMT\ncontent-type: application/json\ncontent-length: 41\ncache-control: no-cache\nvary: Origin\nx-content-type-options:
