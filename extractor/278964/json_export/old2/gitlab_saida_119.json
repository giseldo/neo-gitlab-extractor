So, even if the instance setting is set to `false`, the user profile will be created as a private profile when they start off, but they can later switch it to a public profile themselves.\n\nThe admin, when they create a new user via the UI/API should respect this instance setting.\n\nWhen an admin sends a POST request to `/users` with `private_profile=false` (when the instance setting is `true`) to create a new user, the response should be successful, and the value of the instance setting should be overridden by the value present in the API params.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n* Migration to add a new boolean column in `ApplicationSetting`, `default_to_private_profile`, with a default value of `false`\n* Allow to change this value via the instance admin UI/API\n* New users should inherit this boolean value to `User#private_profile` upon creation\n\n## Availability and Testing\n\n* The E2E test `qa/qa/specs/features/browser_ui/1_manage/user/follow_user_activity_spec.rb` will also need to be updated within this issue. This test uses 2 users- a `followed_user` and `following_user`, where the `followed_user` performs various actions (creating a project, MR, issue, etc.) and the `following_user` visits the `followed_user` profile to verify the correct user activity displays. We need to ensure the `followed_user`'s profile will be set to public.\n  * Add a `data-qa-selector` to the \"Private profile - Don't display activity-related personal information on your profile.\" checkbox element on the user's profile settings page\n  * Create a new page module to represent a user's main profile settings page (ex: `qa/qa/page/profile/show.rb`)\n  * Add the element reference to this page module and create method(s) that toggle the user's profile to private or public\n  * Make changes to `follow_user_activity_spec` to log in as the `followed_user` and use the new method to set their profile to public first before continuing on with the test\n  * Feel free to reach out to @vburton with any questions","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-23T08:12:30.802Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T16:30:40.477Z","closed_at":"2023-01-09T09:40:27.866Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::organization","milestone::p1","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","user profile","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":5251165,"username":"isantospardo","name":"Iago Santos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce47ac80d33ab27f36bb767a3c3fb7f5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/isantospardo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":49,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231301","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231301","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231301/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231301/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#231301","relative":"#231301","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#231301"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7314,"epic":{"id":407708,"iid":7314,"title":"Move Admin Area features to Organization","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7314","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68895717,"iid":231300,"project_id":278964,"title":"Extract variables builder from project/pipeline/build classes","description":"## Description\n\nWe want to optimize the workflow of calculating build variables, as per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213560 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22520.\n\nIn order to make it easier to optimize calculating build variables, we might want to extract variables builder, to a separate class / module. This will make it easier to profile this code, and find deficiencies.\n\n### Problem 1 - from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213560\n\nWhen calling `Ci::CreatePipelineService`, N jobs are created, as specified in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Each of these jobs has a number of environment variables set, and whether the job should be created or not can sometimes *depend* on the value of these variables. Many of the variables are identical for every job in the pipeline; a small number vary between jobs in the same pipeline.\n\nI'm not *too* familiar with the CI areas of the codebase, but to me it looks like we build the list of variables at least once per job. I put a few debugging `puts` statements into `Project#predefined_variables` and elsewhere, created a new pipeline based on GitLab's own `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and got this output:\n\n### Additional Context\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Build: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Build: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Build::Associations: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Build::Associations: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Validate::Abilities: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Validate::Abilities: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Validate::Repository: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Validate::Repository: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Config::Content: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Config::Content: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:54: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Config::Process: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Config::Process: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::RemoveUnwantedChatJobs: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::RemoveUnwantedChatJobs: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Skip: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Skip: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::EvaluateWorkflowRules: START\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::EvaluateWorkflowRules: END\nSEQUENCE#BUILD! 2020-04-06 17:10:55: Step Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Seed: START\n  SEED#STAGE_SEEDS: 2020-04-06 17:10:55 Seed::Stage#included?

Some are backed by database columns in the same model currently holding the code; some go to associated records (which can be expensive with repeated calls, e.g.: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28688 ); others make calls to Gitaly, the results of which may or may not be cached in redis, RequestStore, or instance variables. We see that creating a pipeline can be very slow for GitLab.com, and I think this is at least part of why - repeatedly generating the CI variables is not cheap.\n\n### Problem 2 - from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22520\n\n`Ci::Build#scoped_variables` is responsible for returning all predefined variables that are going to be set in a runner environment.\n\nIt is quite slow, it takes around 2s on my local machine, a little more on production currently.\n\nWe are calling Gitaly three times there, and there is probably some room for optimization.\n\n## Proposal (done in 1st iteration - see next steps)\n\nExtract `Ci::Variables::Builder` class or module. Use dependency injection to manage dependencies on objects that are required to calculate variables like project / pipeline / build etc.\n\nEnsure that we can remove duplicate computations with memoization. For example, we should be able to use the same builder for multiple builds in a pipeline to make the most of memoization.\n\nExpected improvements:\n- we should have the logic to compute CI variables in one place\n- easy to memoize variables (e.g. group, project, pipeline variables) across multiple builds\n- easy to profile and make further improvements when needed \n\n**Merge Request in progress**: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52800\n\n## Next steps\n\n1. [x] Enable the FF introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72348 \u0026 measure results\n1. [ ] Add more variables into the builder, with feature flags, repeating what we did in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72348.\n1. [ ] Plan is pretty much what is described here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/71439#note_702509482\n1. [ ] Over time we should see a decline in the time taken to build these scoped_variables. As measured by the `gitlab_ci_pipeline_builder_scoped_variables_duration` prometheus metric.\n1. [ ] Move more variables into the builder, such that `Build#variables` can be fully moved into a builder object.\n\n## Testing\n\nPlease make sure `package-and-qa` pass in implementation MR.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-23T08:03:12.064Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T18:42:23.798Z","closed_at":"2022-03-11T23:05:36.930Z","closed_by":{"id":9468400,"username":"marknuzzo","name":"Mark Nuzzo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9468400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marknuzzo"},"labels":["CI variables","CI/CD Core Platform","Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Pipeline Authoring","Deliverable","backend","bug::performance","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","maintenance::pipelines","maintenance::refactor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.9","missed:14.4","missed:14.5","missed:14.6","missed:14.8","priority::2","quad-planning::complete-action","section::ops","severity::2","type::maintenance","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"}],"author":{"id":263716,"username":"grzesiek","name":"Grzegorz Bizon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/263716/avatar.jpeg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/grzesiek"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"},"user_notes_count":60,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231300","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":1},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231300","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231300/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231300/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#231300","relative":"#231300","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#231300"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7290,"epic":{"id":405686,"iid":7290,"title":"Pipeline creation is slow","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7290","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":68891343,"iid":231292,"project_id":278964,"title":"Security scanning results are misleading","description":"## Summary\n\nWhen creating a MR that has security vulnerabilities, it says \"scanner detected # **new** severity vulnerabilities\". However, it's a list of vulnerabilities currently in the code base, not new vulnerabilities introduced with the MR. This is causing confusion because people think they introduced new vulnerabilities with their MR. We should remove the word **new** to reduce confusion.\n\nThe source file is `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/security_reports/grouped_security_reports_app.vue`.\n\n## Problem to solve\n\nWith the change introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221084, the merge request now shows a highly visible warning for security vulnerabilities. However, these can sometimes be incorrectly indicated as `new` even though the changed file could not have introduced them (e.g. changing CSS or markdown). This creates confusion for maintainers and reviewers who could believe by merging a minor change they are introducing new security vulnerabilities. As it stands, what is really presented is a list of all findings currently present in the branch—even if the change was not the source of introduction.\n\nIt is important that the merge widget only show clear and accurate information so that it can be trusted by authors, reviewers and maintainers. This has become worse in recent releases because of the new visual treatment which highlights vulnerabilities even more.\n\n![2020-07-23T16.54.55](/uploads/a0e48e93617d48d8961f3b30210f1811/2020-07-23T16.54.55.png)\n\n## Further details\n\nFirst reported in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217311\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nTo address the immediate confusion, removing the word `new` introduced in the recent change will more accurately reflect that branches contain vulnerabilities but did not necessarily introduce them. This will satisfy the core issue highlighted here.\n\nThere are other, related challenges with data quality and consistency that are not the specific problem here but do need to be addressed to improve the quality and trustworthiness of the security MR widget.

When they are redirected to the trial form, we display two banners `Welcome!

A user will still get the confirmation email and future banners in the product to confirm their email.

This can be confusing and is incongruent with the vulnerability details page, where we list the scanner correctly (see screenshot below)\n\nSee Secure Glossary MR for more on the distinction: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/49901/diffs\n\nAdditionally, there will be future sources of vulnerability data that does not come from a scanner/pipeline job. For example, we will soon have the ability to add vulnerability objects by manually creating them or doing so directly via API. This adds further weight to `Scanner` being an inappropriate name for the vulnerability source. To be more clear and more inclusive, we will instead rename this column to `Tool`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nVisit

gl-friendly-wrap in test_suite_table","description":"## Overview\nIn !37249 we added a wrap class to the JUnit report table in order to display the entire suite name and class name in the table, as opposed to truncating it. An improvement to our approach would be to use the `\u003cgl-friendly-wrap\u003e` element instead of performing the change in CSS directly. \n\nAs a frontend engineer, we should use the `\u003cgl-friendly-wrap\u003e` component to ensure consistency across the code base and allow us to universally apply changes to word-wrap as opposed to requiring engineers to look for all occurrences of word-wrap when a change is desired.\n\n## Proposal\nAs discussed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37249#note_383937933) we should use the `\u003cgl-friendly-wrap\u003e` component in the table rows for the JUnit test report.

goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWhen migrating from another product it may be useful to add historical data that is currently in progress, or just to move all the data over to keep it in a single location. For this to work Iterations need to support having dates in the past.\n\nThis is part of adding support for iteration cadences -- https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5077#note_467401527\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to create a new Iteration that has dates in the past.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [ ] allow iteration creation in the past if it does not overlap with existing iterations\n\n\n### Further details\n\nAllows historical data to be migrated into the project from external services.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-22T05:56:43.755Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:02:18.511Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T14:58:04.047Z","closed_by":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","GitLab Starter","Next Up","backend","devops::plan","direction","group::project management","missed:13.9","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"}],"author":{"id":157146,"username":"espadav8","name":"Andrew Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2d2b4964a0d9cfa9c80cf324a635430b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/espadav8"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"user_notes_count":48,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":13,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230894","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 7 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230894","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230894/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230894/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#230894","relative":"#230894","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#230894"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5077,"epic":{"id":163847,"iid":5077,"title":"Support multiple, automated Iteration Cadences","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5077","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68835414,"iid":230893,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST scan rules added to `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES`are shown as PASS in the logs.","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` is used to exclude scan rules from running, the logs show the rules as runs, which is indicated as `PASS`.

While we do have pinned embeds for surfacing Zoom calls, the feature isn't discoverable (can only be used if you happen to know there is a slash command for adding the zoom link). Can we better surface links to other relevant communication channels within incidents?\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n\n### User experience goal\nAllow users to quickly see and access important links that are relevant to quickly resolving an incident.\n\n### Proposal\nFollowing the pattern for the \"Related issues\" widget, introduce a \"Resource Links\" widget to incident issues. Though the use case is strictly for adding links to associated communications channels, by keeping the widget generic enough, people could also use this space to link to other relevant resources, for example, links to Runbooks, relevant dashboards, etc. Here's how this could look:\n\n| Links widget | Links widget expanded | Link added | Adding links when there is an existing link | Tooltip |\n| ------ | ------ |  ------ | ------ | ------ | \n|![Links_widget](/uploads/6b99c1b83c861e549130335a7d86c6e6/Links_widget.png) | ![Links_expanded](/uploads/7cc0ee4d20ab42d0ddfa195b415af1f3/Links_expanded.png) | ![Link_added](/uploads/e5408d390e4c827c8bae43d9736a4da2/Link_added.png)|![Added_with_existing_link](/uploads/563615b08ec6bb84ac7e76df4daa4146/Added_with_existing_link.png)|![Tooltip](/uploads/62e1cd67a1cc34a37422bd86df1e114d/Tooltip.png)|\n\n[Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/N1r3VH8fTH950AvUtpGRNd/Sidebar-links-for-widgets-gitlab-com%26230852?node-id=493%3A24715\u0026scaling=min-zoom\u0026page-id=493%3A24464\u0026starting-point-node-id=493%3A24715)\n\n**_Note: the related issue and related merge request widgets are currently being unboxed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/87886. We should plan on matching the styling of this new links widget to whatever work is done in that MR._**\n\nIf we're implementing it after that MR moves forward, this is how it would look:\n\n| Links widget | Links widget expanded | Link added | Adding links when there is an existing link | Tooltip |\n| ------ | ------ |  ------ | ------ | ------ | \n| ![Links_widget](/uploads/e1b50cef436e9ec3104f744832463356/Links_widget.png) |![Links_expanded](/uploads/30920c5cbed250c2c65ca73a7c1eb9a1/Links_expanded.png) | ![Link_added](/uploads/facc40ee2d81da62c984fa65f2f0ea22/Link_added.png)|![Text_added-1](/uploads/654690d1ddfe3be2c329c4601483ee81/Text_added-1.png)|![Link_added-1](/uploads/2475243be52cac4999d15f2afad62767/Link_added-1.png)|\n\n**Additional notes**\n- If we detect that the link is from Slack or Zoom, we can display those icons next to the relevant link. For other links, we can use the more general [link icon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/blob/main/sprite_icons/link.svg).  \n- Permissions: the links widget will be visible to Developers+, meaning that only Developers and up can view the links, or add new ones.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis works supports the [Incident Management](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/debugging_and_health/incident_management/) direction.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n### Documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n### Links / references\n[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/N1r3VH8fTH950AvUtpGRNd/Sidebar-links-for-widgets-gitlab-com%26230852?node-id=63%3A342)\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-21T22:09:46.133Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T13:32:40.497Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T04:12:07.683Z","closed_by":{"id":8198564,"username":"rkadam3","name":"Rajendra Kadam","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8198564/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkadam3"},"labels":["Category:Incident Management","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","SUS::Impacting","Technical Writing","UI text","backend","backend complete","devops::monitor","direction","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::respond","missed-deliverable","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","section::ops","severity::4","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":8198564,"username":"rkadam3","name":"Rajendra Kadam","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8198564/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkadam3"}],"author":{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8198564,"username":"rkadam3","name":"Rajendra Kadam","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8198564/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkadam3"},"user_notes_count":102,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230852","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230852","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230852/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230852/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#230852","relative":"#230852","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#230852"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3994,"epic":{"id":84244,"iid":3994,"title":"Linked Resources","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3994","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68827942,"iid":230843,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove deprecated `code_owner` references from ApprovalMergeRequestRule","description":"As part of #11834, we want to code that refers to a soon-to-be ignored/removed column `code_owner`.

At a high level this means:\n\n1. Concurrently create a new index with temporary name matching the existing index definition.\n1. Use `with_lock_retries` to swap the names of the new and original index in a transaction, as renaming an index takes an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the index (at least in PG 11).\n1. Drop the original index.\n\nCouple error cases that should be handled:\n\n* Disallow the rake task to operate on `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` indexes.\n* Currently, if `with_lock_retries` exhausts all configured attempts to acquire the lock, it sets the `lock_timeout` to 0 and proceeds, to ensure the migration completes. Since a reindex is a non-critical operation, instead cleanup the temporary index and fail the rake task if the lock cannot be acquired.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-21T20:57:24.753Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:47:24.704Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T09:03:32.107Z","closed_by":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas

Currently, we are instantiating one Vue ap per tab which adds a lot of complexity and also slows down the initial page load significantly. It also prevent us from migrating to use GlTabs component because we still userails to handle the tabs creation.\n\nThis whole work is behind the FF `pipeline_tabs_vue`\n\nTo fix all of these problems, migrating all pipeline tabs to a single Vue app will be a huge benefit.

Today GitLab has perception of being slow. \nFor Global Search how fast should the page load?\n\n2 seconds is the generally accepted standard I have heard for years. I don't know the origin. But it comes form the Idea that \"40% of People expect a page to load in 2 seconds. 40% of people won't wait for 3 seconds\".  I have found references to this dating back to 2003. I wouldn't be surprised if it dates back to the dawn of HTML. \n\n#### Why 2 seconds?\n2 seconds is perceivably fast and I can't expect many users would complain about it being too fast. There are several scenarios where 2 seconds makes since. \n- The page that loads after clicking on an Add. \n- The page that loads after click on a search result. (drilling down)\n\nI have made an observation that what the user expects for information after the click probably correlates to how long they are willing to wait. \n\nAchieving the customers expectations is not about willingness to wait. It still needs to be relatively fast. \n\n### A better model for page load speed expectations\nIn order to set a goal that is meaningful a few details could help in understanding expectations. \nWe can Apply the Fibonacci pattern to account for the time scaling to the value of information. \n\n#### Accounting for the Value or importance of the information on the page. \nThe more detail and more interaction the user can have the larger the value. \n\n- **Homepage** these are generally top level information that contain little interactivity and little depth of information that is not going to be specific to the users current need. This would make a good baseline. We will give it a score of \"1\".\n \n- **Commit/code** are the core of the MR and are probably the most important most interactive page a user might use. We will give it a score of \"5\". \n\n- **Merge Request** adds more value then an issue but not as much as the pages where you can commit and update code. Score of 4. \n\n- **Issue** interactive and a primary source for intake and learning. Score is 3. \n\n- **Search Result pages** Not very interactive, can be valuable to find new link to new information. It is foundational to the other areas. Score of 2. \n\n### Proposed Page Load Time expectation. \n\nHomepage as the Baseline loads in 1.36 Seconds.  \nSearch result page in order to be considered fast would be 2* baseline, or **2.72**. \n\n### Goals by Quarter\n\nWe should plan to cut the time difference in half each quarter.

We observe high NAT port utilization from sidekiq VMs, often correlating high NAT error rates (due to port exhaustion) with high rates of error in the mailers queue. We've started to suspect that the high port demand is due to TCP connection churn to gitlab.com's mail provider, as successive ActionMailer jobs might be opening and closing TCP connections.\n\nWould it be possible to configure the mail client to reuse TCP connections between successive sidekiq jobs that run on the same sidekiq worker process, where possible? This might only be possible within each thread, but that might still make a big impact.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/10629, and issues linked there, for some

Using the API, create a new release (`POST /projects/:id/releases`) with an asset link with a non-default type and a custom `filepath`:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"v4.2\",\n     \"tag_name\": \"v4.2\",\n     \"ref\": \"master\",\n     \"description\": \"Version 4.2\",\n     \"assets\": {\n       \"links\": [\n         {\n           \"name\": \"An example runbook link\",\n           \"url\": \"https://example.com/runbook\",\n           \"link_type\": \"runbook\",\n           \"filepath\": \"/permanent/path/to/runbook\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. A new release will be successfully created and will be returned in the API response.\n1. In the API response, look at the `link_type` and `direct_asset_url` of the newly created asset link.\n\n#### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe `link_type` is `other` (the default value). `direct_asset_url` is `https://example.com/runbook` (the same as `url`).\n\n#### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe `link_type` should be `runbook` as specified in the request JSON. `direct_asset_url` should be `.../-/releases/v4.2/permanent/path/to/runbook`.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-21T13:47:05.978Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T13:51:18.443Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T02:19:06.833Z","closed_by":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P1","UX","UX debt","api","backend","blocker","cicd::active","devops::release","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"}],"author":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230698","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230698","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230698/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230698/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#230698","relative":"#230698","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#230698"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68751013,"iid":230687,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate performance problems with rule html_mailto","description":"### Summary\n\nWhile setting up DAST full scans for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/ we noticed that passive scan rule `html_mailto` takes a long time to execute, which causes the DAST job to time out. Unfortunately, there is no apparent way to disable this rule (e.g. via `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES`).\n\nIt should be possible to disable this rule or to tweak its performance so that the DAST job does not time out.\n\nSome notes from an initial investigation:\n- This rule is implemented in `AutoTagRegexScanner` https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/65afe6af651cc789e96a3079edd86dd025ca8da1/zap/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/pscan/scanner/RegexAutoTagScanner.java. \n- This scanner loads the patterns to scan from a [config file](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/169f349aed4c188c495804e2ddbfe40a27e1d633/zap/src/main/resources/org/zaproxy/zap/resources/config.xml#L76-L85). \n- The problem could lie in the [regex](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/169f349aed4c188c495804e2ddbfe40a27e1d633/zap/src/main/resources/org/zaproxy/zap/resources/config.xml#L83) that is applied to response bodies, which seems not very performant.\n- There is a property called [`enabled`](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/169f349aed4c188c495804e2ddbfe40a27e1d633/zap/src/main/resources/org/zaproxy/zap/resources/config.xml#L84) which might allow us to turn off the rule.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nConfigure a full scan against GitLab or any other application that returns large responses.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs/643427292#L4253\n\nLook for log messages like this:\n`Passive Scan rule html_mailto took 86 seconds to scan https://gitlab-review-ng-dast-fu-m4ht1m.gitlab-review.app/assets/webpack/monaco.9ae6ac28.chunk.js application/javascript 2549011`\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPassive rule `html_mailto` takes a long time to execute, leading to DAST jobs timing out.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPossible solutions:\n- Passive rule `html_mailto` takes less time to execute\n- There is an option to turn off rule `html_mailto`\n\ncc @ngeorge1 @gitlab-org/secure/dynamic-analysis-be","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-21T12:00:25.928Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T03:15:44.929Z","closed_at":"2020-09-03T06:48:54.089Z","closed_by":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"labels":["Category:DAST","backend","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","priority::2","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"}],"author":{"id":2761888,"username":"dappelt","name":"Dennis Appelt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2761888/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dappelt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230687","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230687","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230687/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/230687/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#230687","relative":"#230687","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#230687"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68625992,"iid":230632,"project_id":278964,"title":"[BE] Remove instance-level Value Stream Analytics","description":"~backend portion of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223734\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196455 we removed access to instance level value stream analytics from the top level navigation in favour of group level VSA.

Its header includes a link to the profiles library.\n    - [x] The **Manage profiles** link is disabled if there are no site profiles yet.\n- [x] Pass new required props down to the app:\n  - [x] `profilesLibraryPath`: required to show a link to the profiles library.\n  - [x] `newSiteProfileFormPath`: required to show a link to the **Site profile form**.\n- [x] Trigger a GraphQL query for fetching the existing site profiles and store them in the `siteProfiles` state property. The query will be implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225816.\n- [x] Replace the **Target URL** field with a dropdown to let users select existing site profiles.\n- [x] When a site profile is selected in the dropdown, show a summary of that profile below the dropdown.\n- [x] If `siteProfiles` is empty (i.e. the project doesn't contain any site profiles yet), replace the dropdown with a link to the **Site profile form**. In this case, the submit button can never be enabled.\n- [x] Update the GraphQL mutation to send the required arguments (see [decisions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222755#mutation-for-running-a-dast-scan)).\n- [x] Specs:\n  - ~frontend \n    - [x] The link to the profiles library is displayed properly,

profile** section shows a link to the **Site profile form** when `siteProfiles` is empty.\n    - [x] The GraphQL mutation is built properly.\n  - ~backend \n    - [x] Include new props in

If we instead switch to using [`assert.JSONeq`](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert#JSONEq), then it becomes much easier to understand the reason for the failure:\n\n```\n--- FAIL: TestIssue (0.00s)\n    --- FAIL: TestIssue/MarshalJSON (0.00s)\n        --- FAIL: TestIssue/MarshalJSON/SAST (0.00s)\n            issue_test.go:411:\n                \tError Trace:\tissue_test.go:411\n                \tError:      \tNot equal:\n\n                \t            \tDiff:\n                \t            \t--- Expected\n                \t            \t+++ Actual\n                \t            \t@@ -5,3 +5,3 @@\n                \t            \t- (string) (len=2) \"id\": (string) (len=65) \"1e029c1314252858f37ab31b517c4bd5e99c22eb91b9331e0ee3b65cf3b0a5853\",\n                \t            \t+ (string) (len=2) \"id\": (string) (len=64) \"e029c1314252858f37ab31b517c4bd5e99c22eb91b9331e0ee3b65cf3b0a5853\",\n                \t            \t  (string) (len=11) \"identifiers\": ([]interface {}) (len=1) {\n                \tTest:       \tTestIssue/MarshalJSON/SAST\n```\n\n## Reduced boilerplate testing code\n\nIn addition to making test failure output clearer, using assertions from the [testify package](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert) will also reduce boilerplate testing code.\n\nFor example, instead of constantly inserting checks such as [the following](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/6b8699da5ad515b84b21bf44b318e3c4d8057994/analyze/analyze_test.go#L97-99):\n\n```go\nif !reflect.DeepEqual(want, got) {\n  t.Errorf(\"Wrong result. Expected:\\n%#v\\nbut got:\\n%#v\", want, got)\n}\n```\n\nWe can simply insert an assertion:\n\n```\nassert.Equal(t, want, got)\n```\n\n## Simplified custom matchers\n\nThis change will allow us to remove some [custom JSON Matching code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/6b8699da5ad515b84b21bf44b318e3c4d8057994/internal/testutils/testutils.go#L80-98) which can be replaced by using [`testify.JSONeq`](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert#JSONEq)\n\n## Removal of custom sorting functions\n\nWe'll also be able to use [`assert.ElementsMatch()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert#ElementsMatch) to perform order-agnostic element matching, allowing us to remove a large amount of [sorting code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/87#note_388876057) which is currently used to enforce consistency in some of our tests.\n\n## Reduction of incorrectly written tests\n\nFinally, using assertions will reduce the possibility of errors such as [the following](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gitlab-depscan/-/merge_requests/12#note_374774570) from occurring and by using `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`, we can ensure that a failure will halt tests immediately, instead of needing to remember to [use t.Fatalf](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gitlab-depscan/-/merge_requests/12#note_374759265)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the projects to use the [testify.Assert](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert) package. \n\nWe'll focus on Dependency Scanning first, then open follow-up issues for other groups if they are interested in following the same approach.\n\nIn particular, the unit tests for Gemnasium's dependency file parsers can be simplified, and a lot more readable.

(note that this page doesn't use the modal)\n\n## Code Overview\n\nModal is opened in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/components/license_issue_body.vue` by calling `setLicenseinModal`\n\nAction `setLicenseinModal` is in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/store/actions.js`\n\nMutation is in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/store/mutations.js` and sets `currentLicenseInModal` to the current license.\n\n`\u003cset-license-approval-modal/\u003e` lives in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/mr_widget_license_report.vue` and relies on the `currentLicnseInModal` and `canManageLicenses` state.\n\n`canManageLicenses` is passed from the server via a html data attribute\n\n## Code Changes\n\nBecause the modal is used in two places, (the Pipelines/Licenses tab and the MR widget), we need the button actions to be hidden **only** in the MR widget context. Right now we don't distinguish this when we invoke the actions and mutations needed to show the modal.\n\n- [ ] Add a new state field called `isMRWidget`\n- [ ] Add a new action/mutation to the `LICENSE_MANAGEMENT` vuex module called `setisMRWidget`\n- [ ] In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/mr_widget_license_report.vue` call `this.setIsMRWidget` and set it to `true`\n- [ ] In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/components/set_approval_status_modal.vue` add\n\n```\n...mapState(LICENSE_MANAGEMENT, ['isMrWidget']\n```\n- [ ] In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/components/set_approval_status_modal.vue` update the `canApprove` and `canBlacklist` computed props to\n\n```\n    canApprove() {\n      return (\n        !this.isMrWidget \u0026\u0026\n        this.canManageLicenses \u0026\u0026\n        this.currentLicenseInModal \u0026\u0026\n        this.currentLicenseInModal.approvalStatus !== LICENSE_APPROVAL_STATUS.ALLOWED\n      );\n    },\n    canBlacklist() {\n      return (\n        !this.isMrWidget \u0026\u0026\n        this.canManageLicenses \u0026\u0026\n        this.currentLicenseInModal \u0026\u0026\n        this.currentLicenseInModal.approvalStatus !== LICENSE_APPROVAL_STATUS.DENIED\n      );\n    },\n```\n\n## Unit Test changes\n\n- [ ] Add untit tests for `setisMrWidget` action and mutation\n- [ ] Update unit tests for `ee/spec/frontend/vue_shared/license_compliance/components/set_approval_status_modal_spec.js`regarding the show/hide logic for the \"approve/deny\" buttons. \n\n\n--------\n# Bug\n\nThis is a bugfix follow up issue for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196845. All prior work **should** be behind a feature flag `license_compliance_denies_mr`\n\n## Edge Cases that cause **broken** UI:\n\nIt appears that the **mergeable** logic is updated via`RefreshLicenseComplianceChecksWorker.perform_async(project.id)` worker that runs on license policy creation, update. Don't think it happens for delete? Need to double check.\n\nThe broken edge cases occur when we make policy changes and there is a 2-60 second delay from when the job updates. Incorrect state appears as follows:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-20_at_7.16.51_PM](/uploads/62cbd514a10a7bae5b7148784ac005c0/Screen_Shot_2020-07-20_at_7.16.51_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-20_at_7.17.10_PM](/uploads/00571a04d34455cfa10990699c2fe92b/Screen_Shot_2020-07-20_at_7.17.10_PM.png)\n\n## Video of proper behavior but with significant delays 40-60 seconds.

Namespace querying methods to replace recursive CTE queries. The linear methods are faster and more simple to work with.\n\nCurrently Groups are nested in a parent-child hierarchy. To find groups relative to another group we have to walk the tree recursively. This is implemented through a recursive CTE with generally acceptable query performance. However building queries around the recursive CTE can be complex and result in slow queries.\n\nSome related issues include:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/22046\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217327\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11539\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217937\n\nWe can query the namespace hierarchy a lot faster and easier if we store the path from the root ancestor to each namespace as an attribute on the namespace. We will store this on a new `traversal_id` attribute on `Namespaces`.\n\nSay we have this Namespace hierarchy...\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    gitlab--\u003ebackend;\n    backend--\u003ecreate;\n    backend--\u003emanage;\n    create--\u003esource;\n    manage--\u003eaccess;\n    gitlab--\u003efrontend;\n```\n\nThen the path from `gitlab` to `access` is `gitlab / backend / manage / access`. The path from `gitlab` to `source` is `gitlab / backend / create / source`.\n\nWe can use this structure for fast queries. If the current namespace is `backend` then all our descendants match the path `gitlab / backend / *`, all our ancestors match the path `* / backend`, and everyone in the same Namespace hierarchy matches `gitlab / *`.\n\nWe store that path using an array of Namespace ids in a new column on Namespace called `traversal_ids`.\n\n## Improvements\n\nFaster group hierarchy querying.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to Solve\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33705 we are exposing job names as `name index/total`, but this is not sufficient for someone who is looking at the pipeline jobs to understand what is being worked on there. We should add more context to this name, including variable names. Currently we show:\n\n```plaintext\njobname: 1/2\njobname: 2/2\n```\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \nThis addresses an important UX gap\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe name with variables is already computed at: [lib/gitlab/ci/config/normalizer/matrix_strategy.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b600de609ac964e1e56259c8cd7f605aabbef243/lib/gitlab/ci/config/normalizer/matrix_strategy.rb#L51-55) We should change it to replace the `name` value at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b600de609ac964e1e56259c8cd7f605aabbef243/lib/gitlab/ci/config/normalizer/matrix_strategy.rb#L58\n\nIn the job name we should show all the the values for all the jobs in the matrix. I.e.:\n\n```yaml\ndeploystacks:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - bin/deploy\n  parallel:\n    matrix:\n      - PROVIDER: aws\n        STACK:\n         - monitoring\n         - app1\n         - app2\n      - PROVIDER: ovh\n        STACK: [monitoring, backup, app]\n      - PROVIDER: [gcp, vultr]\n        STACK: [data, processing]\n```\n\nThe above would generate the following parallel jobs each having different values for `PROVIDER` and `STACK`:\n\n```plaintext\ndeploystacks: ovh, monitoring\ndeploystacks: ovh, backup\ndeploystacks: ovh, app\ndeploystacks: gcp, data\ndeploystacks: gcp, processing\ndeploystacks: vultr, data\ndeploystacks: vultr, processing\n```\n\nIf there are very many configuration items or very long values this could extend off the visible area. These should be truncated, with a longer version shown on hover.\n\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.
