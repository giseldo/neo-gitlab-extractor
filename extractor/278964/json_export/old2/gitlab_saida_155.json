Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with `#production` and `#g_delivery` on slack.\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production`\n- [x] Cross post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] After Feature Flag has run for at least 24hrs in production with no reported problems, update the feature flag to default to true and add changelog entry\n- [x] On the following Release, remove feature flag code\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production`

We need to determine what the system protection limit is and set the maximum to that number rather than a number that users are bumping into.\n\nWe also want to provide a (potentially unsupported) very high limit for self-managed instance administrators who choose to do so.\n\nSee also infrastructure issue at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/7541\n\nCurrent limitations are documented at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#requirements-and-limitations\n\n**Note that majority of the efforts of this issue have been merged, please refer to: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197886#note_394376627 for the work remaining**\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Update the DAG limit for normal operation to 50 users, and apply this feature flag in production.\n2. Set a \"crazy\" limit feature flag that allows for setting the limit to something like 1000, for instance administrators at their own risk. We have users who are running things at this level, so it isn't a footgun, but it is an untested configuration (officially) and helps teams who are doing so not to source patch GitLab.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? \n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Plese use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance : https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Exportable Security Reports MVC","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUsers are unable to effectively share the results of our security reports outside GitLab.  They need to provide these reports to their managers, compliance teams, and sometimes their clients. They need a human readable format that can be printed or sent via email.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\n***NOTE***: This should be built on top of the new standalone vulnerability object model.\n\nFor an MVC, we will add functionality enabling the user to download a Project's security report in a CSV format. This includes:\n\n* A button to download the report from the Project-level Security Dashboard\n* Dismissible popover calling attention to the new functionality containing a link to the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/197111) for leaving feedback (pointed to the button with a link to the feedback issue for first time view (does not reappear after dismissed))\n* Generated CSV file is dynamically named such that it is easily recognizable and distinguishable from other reports.  For example: \"project-name_2020-01-01T14:05.csv\"\n\n**Suggested CSV Headers:**\nThis is not all data available in the [JSON security reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#reports-json-format) but it should be the relevant information for such a report. First part is the suggested header field name, item in parentheses is the parameter name in the JSON schema from which to pull this data:\n\n*  Scanner Type (\"category”)\n*  Scanner Name (“scanner”: {”name”})\n*  Vulnerability (\"name”)\n*  Details (“description”)\n*  Additional Info (“message”)\n*  Severity (“severity”)\n*  CVE (“cve”)\n*  Status (not from JSON; this is vuln state like 'Confirmed', 'Dismissed', etc.)\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\nTBD\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocument the new functionality, being sure to clearly call out:\n1.  This is currently for Project-level Security Dashboards only\n1.  Report is a CSV containing relevant data for ALL vulnerabilities present in default branch; applying visual filters on the Security Dashboard will not yet filter corresponding vulnerabilities from the report.\n1.  Helpful screenshots, as appropriate\n\nSuggested location: update to existing https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#project-security-dashboard\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nWe have at least one customer that can take our report export and use it to satisfy a request from an internal team or one of their clients.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\ncc @matt_wilson @chloe @cbazan @plafoucriere @stkerr @NicoleSchwartz","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-17T23:12:53.782Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T19:23:51.246Z","closed_at":"2020-04-21T07:56:38.066Z","closed_by":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","UX","backend","customer","devops::govern","direction","documentation","frontend","frontend-weight::5","group::threat insights","security dashboard","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":4415483,"username":"beckalippert","name":"Becka Lippert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4415483/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/beckalippert"},{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"}],"author":{"id":4415483,"username":"beckalippert","name":"Becka Lippert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4415483/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/beckalippert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4415483,"username":"beckalippert","name":"Becka Lippert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4415483/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/beckalippert"},"user_notes_count":98,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-04-16","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197494","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197494","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197494/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197494/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#197494","relative":"#197494","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#197494"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1765,"epic":{"id":10900,"iid":1765,"title":"Vulnerability Management - Minimal to Viable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1765","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29715802,"iid":197491,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move issue/epic hierarchy items to a tool tip","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen looking at an Epic tree view for an Epic with a lot of sub epics, I see epics and issues with their name and identifier.

one CA certificate is loaded for smart card authentication","description":"### Summary\nIf multiple certificates are present in the file specified in GitLab.rb gitlab_rails['smartcard_ca_file'], only one certificate is loaded. This appears to prevent successful smart card authentication for customers where multiple root CAs or intermediate certificates are needed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Configure a standalone gitlab instance for smart card authentication\n2. Use a file with multiple certificates as the ca file specified in gitlab_rails['smartcard_ca_file']\n3. Attempt to log in using smart card authentication\n\n### Example Project\n@SteveTerhar can suggest a customer who can work with us on this.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nUsers who attempt to authenticate are redirected to the login page and presented with a \"Failed to signing using smartcard authentication\" alert message.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nThe system should perform a match on e-mail and log the user into the correct GitLab account.\n\n### Possible fixes\nBecause the store function in smartcard/base.rb calls store.add_cert, only one cert in the smartcard_ca_file is loaded. By changing that call to store.add_file we were able to load multiple certs and log in successfully. \n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/lib/gitlab/auth/smartcard/base.rb#L15\n\nNote: If we use add_file and include intermediate certificates in the file, I believe the intermediate certs would  be treated like root certs and trusted without any verification. We would have to validate that this wouldn't introduce a vulnerability.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-17T18:45:59.076Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T20:52:01.067Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T13:38:39.370Z","closed_by":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","missed-SLO","missed:12.10","missed:12.9","priority::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"}],"author":{"id":4267173,"username":"SteveTerhar","name":"Steve Terhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc6e122c4d8b5e94ce5eaab27bc7984f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SteveTerhar"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197463","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197463","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197463/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197463/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#197463","relative":"#197463","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#197463"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2520,"epic":{"id":18542,"iid":2520,"title":"Smart Card Authentication for the Public Sector","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2520","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29707879,"iid":197412,"project_id":278964,"title":"Track usage of merge request file header buttons","description":"Originally from the discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31300#note_255205324\n\nWe want to understand how often people use each of the file header buttons when viewing a merge request's changes.

bot member for Suggested Solution (was: Auto Remediation)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIn the auto-remediation [MVC user research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OtLhQRtuLbL7orKMFKXnOCuKLuGijqq8aR6XbhZvHjc/edit#slide=id.g6c2267be5e_0_820) (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36500), we found users are not comfortable with being the author of the `auto-created` merge request. There isn't currently a bot or neutral member/user we could use as an alternative.\n\n:film_projector: [view issue kickoff: context, ideation, and questions review](https://youtu.be/9kiZeWKuCOk)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nBased on an MVC proposal for a bot (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36500#note_260858531), this discovery looked into the 1) engineering/implementation requirements, 2) security concerns using a `bot` member, 3) UX with using `bot`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nConsider adding a \"bot\" user to Ultimate tier instance, called `GitLab-Security-Bot`. This user would be the author of the auto-created merge requests.\n\n| **Bot overview**  | \n| ------ | \n| ![bot_profile](/uploads/8bb331eee9fdbc71856ca5ad8b9572b0/bot_profile.png) | \n\nUse case for auto-remediation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36500:\n\n| **When activating feature:** user that enables the feature in the configuration section and the `auto-created MR` authored by `GitLab Vulnerability Bot` (instance user account). The feature is opt-in by default, once container and/or dependency scanning are configured  | \n| ------ | \n| ![flow](/uploads/2a85ad09ce2af12d59d45189eec307d4/flow.png) | \n\n \n##### Discovery review and findings:\n\n* Learn about our existing “bots” functionality `GitLab Support Bot (Service Desk)` and/or `GitLab Alert Bot` \n     * How are they created?\n          * https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/10159 - Bot is added on instance-level. It's `User`. From the backend side of things bot can be called by `User.security_bot`. It creates a `User` entity in the database. Bot isn't a member of any project, it is visible only from Users tab in the Admin panel. Such Bot doesn’t take a seat in the License plan. Bot has a User profile, its username can be used in queries by MR’s author name.\n     * Are they out of the box?\n          * Adding a new bot is quite simple: add new bot to ee/app/models/ee/user_bot_type_enums.rb and follow example for [Alert bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/10460/diffs) \n     * How do they work for saas vs on-premise?\n          * It works in the same manner.\n     * Are the current bots visible members?\n          * Yes, for example: `support bot` is visible in the list and the functionality is shown like others, but the user is unable to take actions (goes to 404 page when executed). issue created: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208793. For the `GitLab Security Bot` we can display the user to surface documentation (actions not visible in UI)\n     * How we can add Bot as an MR author?\n          * How to assign Bot as an author of MR?\n               * Proposed workflow:\n                   * Pipeline is successfully finished.\n                   * We check if available solutions are available on the backend.\n                   * If there are solutions available, we create an MR with the help of `VulnerabilityFeedback::CreateService` and we put security_bot as an author of the MR. (now this service use current user as an author)\n               * We can reuse this code https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/197808d37204cc16886e3404e47205555a24335c/ee/app/services/vulnerability_feedback/create_service.rb#L75 to create an MR automatically. We just need to change `current_user` to `bot`.\n     * What might we be able to reuse?\n     * How do make sure the extra member doesn't add a seat?\n          * These bots ain't members, they are \"users\" on instance level and are operated from inside of GitLab. That means that we can use those bots for any projects. \n* For the use case of auto-remediation MVC:\n     * Can we have this bot as a member that’s out of the box? Consider UX when the member is deactivated and the relationship with the opt-in of `auto-create merge request`\n     * UX for findability and discovery of the bot\n     * Bot member profile page activity - what/when activity will be shown\n     * Identify permissions: who can setup/deactivate feature/bot? Is the bot member a developer?\n* What are the security concerns?\n     * Will sync with our appsec team with proposed prototype to review and analyze for security issues\n* Learn about any use cases that may follow\n\n##### other considerations:\n* Have a link to the Bot's documentation page in the bot's profile that explains the account and how to manage it and what it does\n* For opened merge request, having it automatically assigned could be helpful and/or that aligns to an orgs workflow\n* Add activity or note that \"This MR was generated automatically by GitLab\" or similar to bot action occurs \n* If we have built-in user accounts, these accounts should have something more than a gravatar and a \"Bot\" name, there should be some design treatment that clearly denotes this account as a system account.\n\n##### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* In testing our MVC: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36500, we found users said they would create a new member to `auto-create the merge requests`. Does the user use the `GitLab-Security-Bot` instead?\n* Does the user understand the bot is a member and understands it's role (author of merge request)?\n* Does the user know how to setup the feature? \n\n##### What is the type of buyer? \n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n\n# Discovery Conclusion\n\n**Discovery outcome:** UX/Engineering recommends the [proposed solution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197349#proposal) to introduce a `GitLab-Security-Bot` user in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36500. \n\n### Engineering notes\n\n##### How to create a bot?\nAdding a new bot is quite simple: you need to add bot to bots_hash and create a class method for User model. Example of adding Alert bot: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/10460/diffs \n\n##### Is Bot a User?\nYes, from the code bot can be called by `User.security_bot`. It creates a User entity in the database. Bot isn't a member of any project, it is visible only from Users tab in the Admin panel. Such Bot doesn’t take a seat in License plan. Bot has a User profile, its username can be used in queries by MR’s author name.\n\n##### How to assign Bot as an author of MR?\nProposed workflow:\nPipeline is successfully finished.\nWe check if available solutions are available on the backend.\nIf there are solutions available, we create an MR with the help of VulnerabilityFeedback::CreateService and we put security_bot as an author of the MR. (now this service use current user as an author)\nWe can reuse this code https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/197808d37204cc16886e3404e47205555a24335c/ee/app/services/vulnerability_feedback/create_service.rb#L75 to create an MR automatically. We just need to change `current_user` to `bot`.\n\n### UX notes\n\n##### Ongoing and next step efforts:\n* Displaying projects that https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210519 is configured in the profile. This is to help the user understand what projects are affected by the system bot. (since the profile will span across different projects)\n* UX bug: removing front-end actions available to bots in admin \u003e user, related issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195309. The `Security Bot` will be seen in the admin \n* Work closely with the technical writing team to ensure clear documentation. Additionally, evaluate as new tasks are added to the bot.\n* In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36503 and any other system tasks the bot may adopt: evaluate with app sec team to ensure alignment and identify security concerns.\n* Look into creating a custom bot emoji to reinforce it’s a bot (key UXR question: do users understand this is a system, not their org user)\n* Visual design: 1)  create an avatar for the security bot, and 2) align profile with other bots for consistency and better communication to the user that it’s a system bot (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210523). Example: that https://gitlab.com/support-bot does not include links to documentation or visually anything to distinguish it as a system bot. \n\n##### User research questions:\n* What is the user’s perception of the bot?\n* Does the user understand that the user is a GitLab system feature?\n* If the user wants to learn more, what do they do?\n* Is the documentation accessible and clear?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-17T08:42:12.905Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:52:08.914Z","closed_at":"2020-03-13T15:57:28.531Z","closed_by":{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"},"labels":["AST Leadership","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","UX","auto remediation","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","type::feature","vulnerability interaction","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"}],"author":{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},"user_notes_count":72,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197349","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197349","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197349/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197349/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#197349","relative":"#197349","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#197349"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2238,"epic":{"id":15349,"iid":2238,"title":"Auto-remediation UX foundation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2238","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29691706,"iid":197343,"project_id":278964,"title":"Unexpected behavior around the lastCommitMsg and isCompact","description":"From @cwoolley-gitlab's [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21067#note_272876171) on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21067:\n\nI'm seeing some unexpected behavior after this commit around the `lastCommitMsg` and `isCompact`. This occurs on this commit (`bc303216fdf`) but not on the previous commit (`c8af18ef2a6`)\n\n## To reproduce:\n\n1. Open the Web IDE for some repo on which you have permission to commit to master.\n1. Make sure your window is taller than `MAX_WINDOW_HEIGHT_COMPACT = 750`\n1. Modify a file\n1. Click the \"commit\" tab in the left sidebar.\n1. (if you are on the previous commit) stage the change.\n1. Enter a commit message\n1. Select \"Commit to **master** branch\"\n1. Click \"Commit\"\n1. You will return to the \"Edit\" tab (commit message is gone, commit is successful)\n1. You will temporarily see a message like \"Successful commit. All changes are committed...Your changes have been committed. Commit 8c0fb422 with 1 additions, 1 deletions.\" (this is the `lastCommitMsg`.\n1. Then the message disappears\n\n## Expected\n\n1. After the `lastCommitMsg` disappears, the commit area slides down, and only shows a disabled \"Commit\" button and message \"0 unstaged and 0 staged changes\"\n\n## Actual\n\n1. After the `lastCommitMsg` disappears, the un-compact commit form reappears, with the commit message text area, master/branch radio buttons, and \"Stage \u0026 Commit\"/\"Collapse\" buttons.\n\nFYI, I found this while trying to rebase/reconcile these changes with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21010#note_272731415.\n\nAlso, as a heads up, I see inconsistent behavior when exploring this in local GDK. Sometimes, when clicking the commit tab after making a change, the commit form is compact when it shouldn't be. But I've never been able to reproduce it while debugging to figure out why.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-17T06:41:08.107Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T08:15:49.267Z","closed_at":"2020-01-17T08:15:49.193Z","closed_by":{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia

Currently GitLab performs those diffs by either 1) asking Gitaly to do it or 2) using [a Ruby class](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/lib/gitlab/diff).  Those options are fine for performing a single diff.  But those require too much processing when you want to diff many commits once, like [for internal metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/merge_requests/2120#note_268821747) and

complexity is of interest.\n\n### Proposal\n\nStore `deleted_lines` and `added_lines` in the `merge_request_metrics` table (where `diff_size`, `modified_paths_size`, and `commits_count` are already stored).\n\nNote: There is some [early support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/merge_requests/2120#note_269101000) for this idea.\n\n### Technical notes\n\n- To see existing usage in the

GitLab.com today involves opening a ticket with GitLab support, and having a validated member of the customer's userbase \"vouch\" for the identity of the requestor. For our customers with large numbers of users, this can be a fairly common need.\n\nAllowing group owners the ability to reset 2FA for members of the group would speed up this process and remove some of the ticket load from support.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/merge_requests/58)\n\n[The Analytics Controller](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/controllers/groups/analytics_controller.rb#L30) checks if promotions are on before choosing what is rendered.\n\nThe same check is done in a couple other places:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/helpers/ee/groups_helper.rb#L68\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/views/groups/analytics/show.html.haml#L69\n\nWe want to re-factor the code, by creating a new controller action (eg. `promotion`) with a `before_action` that redirects to `promotion_path` if `show_promotions?` is true.\n\n## Improvements\n\n\u003c!--\nExplain the benefits of refactoring this code.\nSee also https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\n## Risks\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.\n--\u003e\n\n## Involved components\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T15:59:37.699Z","updated_at":"2020-03-02T22:07:22.912Z","closed_at":"2020-01-29T09:16:54.040Z","closed_by":{"id":4158075,"username":"aakriti.gupta","name":"Aakriti

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n## Problem to solve\n\n\u003e As a user, I want to understand which job triggers a child pipeline, so I can understand the progression of the pipeline.\n\nAll child pipelines have the same appearance and there is no information that can link back to the job triggering them. \n\nThe user needs to expand the child pipeline and look at the jobs in it to understand what the pipeline is about.\n\n| Screenshot of pipeline with multiple child pipelines, not easy to know which jobs triggered which child pipeline |\n| --- |\n| ![image](/uploads/5b2954be74b9f6a0227735029cfc2108/image.png) |\n\n## Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n## User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate a visual link between the trigger job and the child pipeline.\n\n1. When a user hovers on a job that is a bridge job, visually highlight the linked downstream pipeline\n2. When user hovers on a downstream/child pipeline, visually highlight the trigger job in the parent pipeline\n3. Change the display name of the child and downstream pipelines to 'Child Pipeline \u003c#ID\u003e' or 'Project name \u003c#ID\u003e', respectively to make the relation clearer\n4. On hover \n   • For bridge jobs, shown the information about the pipeline that it triggers in the tooltip\n   • For child/downstream pipelines, show the information about the job that triggers it\n(Designs are attached to the issue)\n\n## Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nFor a future iteration, we can address in a separate issue this proposed approach from [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197140#note_306946790):\n\nTo visualize which job created a specific child pipeline, instead of using labels we could enhance the display name of the downstream (child or multi-project) pipeline:\n\n* Today is in the form like `gitlab • #86` (project + pipeline ID)\n* A great improvement would be adding more context like `test/docs ▶ gitlab • #86` where `test` and `docs` are respectively the stage and job name of the trigger job that created the downstream pipeline.\n\n\u003c!-- ## Permissions and Security --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate?

Vue Alert wrapper around GlAlert","description":"## Why\n\nCurrently there isn't a very simple way to implement a `Flash` alert that follows the design specs of the [Alert component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/alert/) in parts of GitLab where a Vue instance doesn't currently exist.\n\nAn example of this was found when trying to implement: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22933\nResulted in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22933/diffs#37d2cdd5469d664aa921a1680417aa4af9a5fe9e_11_16\n\n**tldr;** A way to fire a more robust Flash message from Ruby without an existing Vue instance isn't currently possible.\n\n## Proposal\n\nBy creating a generic `Vue component` that wraps [GlAlert](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-alert--default) we can add a simple way to fire an `up-to-spec` alert with very few lines of code from anywhere in our HAML files.\n\n## How\n\n1. Create a JS entry point in the scoped HAML file: \u003cbr /\u003e\n      ```haml\n         - if condition\n           #js-vue-alert{ data: { variant: 'tip', message: '...', btn_options: { ... } } }\n      ```\n\n2. This entry point will import a small script that inits a Vue instance:\n      ```js\n        import initVueAlert from '~/vue_alert';\n        initVueAlert();\n      ```\n3. vue-alert will instantiate the Vue instance from `@gitlab/ui`\n      ```js\n        import { Gl Alert } from '@gitlab/ui';\n\n        export default () =\u003e {\n          const el = document.querySelector('.js-vue-alert');\n\n          return new Vue({\n            el,\n            components: { GlAlert },\n            ...\n          })\n        };\n      ```\n\ncc: @nfriend","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-15T21:51:34.237Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T22:10:29.031Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T16:32:40.284Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["UI component","devops::systems","frontend","group::geo","javascript","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"}],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197113","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197113","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197113/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197113/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#197113","relative":"#197113","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#197113"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29643674,"iid":196983,"project_id":278964,"title":"Restrict Access-Control-Expose-Headers by API endpoint","description":"## Summary\n\n!22838 addressed #194897, added missing headers to `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`.

Apollo cache updates to be immutable in Design Management application","description":"## Summary\n\nIn Apollo 2.6 a few new options were provided (namely, `assumeImmutableResults`, `freezeResults`, and `returnPartialData`) for rendering components faster and more smoothly.\n\nWhile Apollo Client cannot mandate immutable data processing for all application code that consumes cache results, it can reward us for writing our code in an immutable style. In Apollo Client 2.6, if we’re confident that the application code does not modify cache result objects, we can unlock substantial performance improvements by communicating this assumption to the ApolloClient constructor via passing `assumeImmutableResults: true`. So far we don't have a lot of mutations in GitLab's codebase but our usage of GraphQL is growing and it's better to leverage the immutability now, rather than rewrite updates later.\n\nMore to say, in Apollo Client 3.0, authors intend to make both `freezeResults` and `assumeImmutableResults` true by default (meaning we would need to make this work to upgrade anyway).\n\n## Improvements\n\nWe can gain slight performance improvements right now (considering the fact we have just a few mutations) and we can stick to this 'more performant' strategy while our GraphQL codebase grows.\n\n## Risks\n\nThere are no significant risks as the updates logic won't change: the result is going to be the same\n```javascript\nmyArray.push(1)\n// the code below will provide the same result\nmyArray = [...myArray, 1]\n```\n\nHowever, we need to be careful when enabling `assumeImmutableResults` and `freezeResults` and check with console errors that we _really_ have an immutable update.

It is available as Docker image, and [its base image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/v2.6.0/Dockerfile#L1) is `python:3.6-alpine`. Alpine Linux is not [manylinux2010](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/#the-manylinux2010-policy) compatible, and many Python wheels cannot be installed. Switching to Debian makes possible to install packages like `Pillow` using `manylinux1_x86_64` binary wheels. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13694#note_222160347\n\nThe official Debian image is much bigger than Linux Alpine. The slim variant of Debian is also bigger than Linux Alpine, but the difference is less than 100 MB.\n\nThe installation of Python packages is needed for Python projects having no supported dependency lock file. For instance, it is required when the Python project uses pip, and the pip requirements file is not a lock file.\n### Proposal\n\nChange the base image of [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) to Debian Slim. The change would result in the 250 MB Docker image, compared to the 170 MB for the Alpine based image.

So for example if emails is delivered to `support+gitlab-org/gitlab@gitlab.com`, it will extract project from the part after `+` - same as we do for other incoming emails, the difference is that we don't need too complicated pattern after `+` because we already know this is a service desk email based the separate address before `+` - `support+...@gitlab.com`. The pattern of the key will be `project_slug-configurable_name` - for example for `gitlab` project it would be `gitlab-org-gitlab-configurable_name`.\n\nThen in the next step - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/2201 - we can make the `+{key}` configurable.\n\nWe will probably have to update also omnibus configuration to pre-generate this new config section in gitlab.yml. And also update gdk with this default config.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-15T08:10:06.696Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T00:34:46.873Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T13:57:00.838Z","closed_by":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"labels":["Category:Service Desk","backend","devops::plan","group::respond","missed:12.7","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196827","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196827","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196827/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196827/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#196827","relative":"#196827","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#196827"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29617856,"iid":196825,"project_id":278964,"title":"Transient failure in `spec/features/discussion_comments/merge_request_spec.rb[1:1:2:4:5:2:4]` / `expected to find visible css \".fa-check\" ... but there were no matches`","description":"As seen in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs/403056501:\n\n```\n1955   1) Thread Comments Merge Request behaves like thread comments when the toggle is clicked when selecting \"Start thread\" when opening the menu when selecting \"Comment\" has \"Comment\" selected when opening the menu\n1956      Got 1 failure and 1 other error:\n1957      Shared Example Group: \"thread comments\" called from ./spec/features/discussion_comments/merge_request_spec.rb:17\n1958      1.1) Failure/Error: expect(items.first).to have_selector '.fa-check'\n1959             expected to find visible css \".fa-check\" within #\u003cCapybara::Node::Element tag=\"li\" path=\"/HTML/BODY[1]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[3]/DIV[1]/DIV[2]/DIV[2]/DIV[3]/DIV[2]/DIV[1]/SECTION[1]/DIV[1]/DIV[4]/DIV[1]/UL[1]/LI[1]/DIV[1]/DIV[3]/FORM[1]/DIV[3]/DIV[1]/UL[1]/LI[1]\"\u003e but there were no matches.

up","description":"## Hypothesis\nWe believe that by making the phone number field optional in the SaaS trial sign up we will increase the trial creation rate and increase the total IACV generated from trials. \n \n## Business problem\nThe required phone number field is only as valuable as the data that it collects and based on our analysis 77.8% of the time it is not providing the business with any value due to fake phone number submissions while reducing the trial conversion rate by up to 5%. \n \n## Supporting data\nIt is a common industry understanding that requiring a phone number field during a form submission reduces the submission rate. Unbounce indicates that on average it reduces form conversions by 5% ([source](https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-optimize-contact-forms/)). By requiring a non-validated phone number field we're reducing our form conversion rate without the added benefit of a valid phone number for the sales team. \n \nI analyzed the most recent 1,000 submissions to the trial form and found that 77.8% of the phone number submitted were fake. I defined \"fake\" in this analysis as any phone number with less than 7 digits or highly visible pattern i.e. 1234567 or 1231234 etc. \n  \n## Expected outcome\nBy making the phone number field optional field we believe that we will increase the trial creation rate by 3% and generate more IACV than the control group.\n \n## Experiment design \u0026 implementation\nWe will run a 50/50 experiment where 50% of users (control group) will get the standard trial sign up form where the phone number field is required and 50% of users (experiment group) will get a trial sign up form where the phone number field will be optional. \n \nWe will measure the trial sign up rates between the control and experiment groups. We will then monitor the trial upgrade rates within 45 days of the trial start date for both the control and experiment groups. \n\n| Base | Variant |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![MBP-13-viewport-trialFlow--current](/uploads/66e864cb3106e8470044ef8210529db5/MBP-13-viewport-trialFlow--current.jpg) | ![MBP-13-viewport-trialFlow--optionalPhoneField](/uploads/e60802cd1bd99442d590113c345fd43c/MBP-13-viewport-trialFlow--optionalPhoneField.jpg)|\n| Current version of https://gitlab.com/-/trials/new | Variant with optional phone number field | \n \n## ICE score\n\n| Impact | Confidence | Ease | Score |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| 8 |  7 |  9 | 8 |\n \n## Known assumptions\nWe don't know the actual increase in the trial creation rate we will see by making the phone number field optional, 3% was an estimate based on Unbounce analysis where they saw a 5% increase when the phone number field was removed. \n \nWhile we know that 77.8% of the phone numbers submitted are fake.

Thanks backend! :smile:\n\n**Snippet show page:**\n\n* [User snippets (FE entrypoint)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/412f62919340e5df7505749927202bf6ea8b3785/app/views/snippets/show.html.haml#L11)\n* [Project snippets (FE entrypoint)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/7f15dacb5504b0ba7f9eb73e8a60e494e3473274/app/views/projects/snippets/show.html.haml#L10)\n\nThis is the only page we'll consider at the moment since it's the only one requiring upcoming changes.\n\n### New functionality (versioned snippets) components\n\nAt it's simplest implementation, versioned snippets will require the following UI components (whether implemented in HAML or Vue):\n\n* Tabs\n* Revision list\n\nFor page load performance, we should avoid loading all the data at once, which requires that some scripting is necessary. Migrating to Vue can make implementing these new features more efficient and reliable, while staying in HAML + Vanilla JS can make things difficult to test and maintain.\n\n### Existing functionality components\n\nSo what does migrating to Vue look like? Here's a list of components which compose the current snippets UI:\n\n* Page Header (can be left in HAML)\n* Title\n* Description\n* Embed actions\n* File header\n* File content\n* Comment box\n\nThankfully there's some preexisting components we can reuse here, making these changes mostly trivial. Some non-trivial components include the file header and content. There's an opportunity of reusing preexisting components here, but it's not perfect.\n\nAnother non-trivial piece is loading the extra data that's needed (e.g. snippet previewed content, snippet links, extra meta information). Most of this is already available in the API, but some new fields will probably be needed.\n\n#### Reusability opportunity\n\nIt looks like we can easily reuse the existing CSS.\n\nThe following components contain **mostly** reusable code, but some will require some refactoring to make reusable for our case:\n\n* [Markdown comment Vue component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/2d94e2c913417c2d1cce1bcc9c0ab4ede97a0d25/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/markdown/field.vue#L209)\n* [Reaction component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/0c028a816b6d8941b435291f298e1fffaa7b5af0/app/assets/javascripts/notes/components/note_awards_list.vue#L174)\n* [Use of clipboard in Vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/e95a6d1bb93e02df57334af2fd06a0c2ee9cf2dc/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/modal_copy_button.vue#L70)\n* File component:\n  * [`app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_content.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/5d31e16e808bff9cc101422e17f3596a5f288461/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_content.vue#L102)\n  * [`app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_file_header.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/059461232a12c4bef1a3f5014c5746791010f65a/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_file_header.vue#L63)\n\n#### Concerns\n\nThere's some crossover with the new file component and MR diffs. We should make sure we do this right and find an abstraction that serves both. I label this as a concern, because this will require some attention.\n\n#### Rest vs. GraphQL\n\nSince we will probably need some more data properties exposed in the API, it's worth evaluating whether now is a good time to migrate to GraphQL. This is especially relevant as the schema for the API will grow in complexity due to the upcoming features.\n\nCons:\n\n* Extra work involved with unfamiliar area.\n\nOpportunities:\n\n* It's easier to create requests that progressively load the page (i.e. load file heads, and then content). This is because the only work needed is to define the shared schema (not each individual request/response).\n\nPros:\n\n* Easier full stack collaboration.\n\n#### Proposal\n\n**Should we refactor snippets to GraphQL now?**\n\nI'd like BE to weigh in on GraphQL vs. Rest. From the FE, the immediate costs could outweigh the benefits, but it's possible the long term BE benefits are worth it.\n\n**Should we refactor to Vue now?**\n\nYes. This will **greatly** help implement the changes being proposed in the versions feature and future features.\n\n#### Proposal\n\nI suggest we do a Vue refactoring (no new features) behind a feature flag in one release. We might need some new data exposed in the API (e.g. rendered snippet content), so if we're planning on also migrating to GraphQL, we should probably do this in one swing to minimize the amount of temporary code.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-14T09:54:16.296Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T07:22:46.095Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T07:22:46.053Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"labels":["Architecture decision","Category:Snippets","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"}],"author":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196712","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196712","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196712/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196712/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#196712","relative":"#196712","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#196712"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29579128,"iid":196710,"project_id":278964,"title":"gitlab_subscriptions trial column being nil and false","description":"`GitlabSubscription` contains a `trial` column, which defaults to false.

Container Scanning changed to an integration test structure as well ([more info](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/181#note_467371952)).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-14T05:59:36.415Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T16:31:43.019Z","closed_at":"2020-12-18T16:31:42.976Z","closed_by":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"labels":["AST Leadership","Category:Container Scanning","Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:SAST","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","blocked","bug::performance","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:13.6","quad-planning::complete-action","section::sec","test","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196697","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":19,"completed_count":19},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"19 of 19 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196697","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196697/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196697/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#196697","relative":"#196697","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#196697"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3239,"epic":{"id":51011,"iid":3239,"title":"Performance and Size Baselines recording and tracking","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3239","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":29568225,"iid":196694,"project_id":278964,"title":"Replace underscore with lodash for ./app/assets/javascripts/blob","description":"Replace all underscore methods with native javascript functions (when possible) or lodash equivalents within the directory listed in the title.
