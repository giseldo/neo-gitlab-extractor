Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nImproves rendering of lanes for Epics Swimlanes.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIssues rendering Epics Swimlanes.\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [ ] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set swimlanes_buffered_rendering true --staging`)\n- [ ] Test on staging\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab swimlanes_buffered_rendering true`)\n- [ ] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [ ] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry. Ensure that the feature flag definition YAML file has been removed in the **same MR** that is removing the feature flag from the code\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab swimlanes_buffered_rendering false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T00:18:46.175Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T23:40:16.297Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T23:40:16.279Z","closed_by":{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie Guibert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/705331e7e375d5832c9fa5309370b55f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fguibert"},"labels":["devops::plan","feature flag","group::product planning","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie Guibert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/705331e7e375d5832c9fa5309370b55f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fguibert"}],"author":{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie Guibert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/705331e7e375d5832c9fa5309370b55f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fguibert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie Guibert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/705331e7e375d5832c9fa5309370b55f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fguibert"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324994","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":12,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 12 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324994","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324994/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324994/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#324994","relative":"#324994","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324994"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3353,"epic":{"id":55864,"iid":3353,"title":"Epic Swimlanes Follow up Iteration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3353","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":81066216,"iid":324990,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST On-Demand: Move DAST site validation to runner","description":"### Problem to Solve\nWhen a user saves a url, the built-in url validation prohibits the saving of any url that resolves to a non-routable address as documented by users, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/270751. This is done as a security measure so that the monolith does not access a non-routable url. \n\n### Solution\n1) Move the domain validation work to a runner. By moving the validation to a runner, the runner can validate a domain regardless of whether that domain resolves to an internal ip or an external ip. \n\n2) Once the domain validation is done exclusively on the runner, and monolith/sidekiq no longer visit domains from their trusted servers, the domain validation should be removed from the model. \n\nThe validation error exposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/270751, will auto-resolve.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [x] Add feature flag (`:dast_runner_site_validation`) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61649\n- [x] Add internal API https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61649\n- [x] Add container for validation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast-runner-validation/-/merge_requests/1\n- [x] Release container https://gitlab.com/security-products/dast-runner-validation/container_registry\n- [x] Add validation strategy to the monolith behind feature flag https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/65794\n- [x] [Add new `ci_pipelines.source` for

tests using the Secure test projects and \"QA jobs\" don't check the exit code.\n\n### Proposal\n\nChange the [CI template used for integration tests of Dependency Scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-dependency_scanning.yml) to capture and compare the exit code.\n\nHere are two options:\n1. override the `script` of the scanning job to capture the exit code, pass it to the corresponding `qa-` job using artifacts, and there compare it to an expected value\n1. override the `script` of the scanning job to compare it to the expected code, and fail if it doesn't match\n\nThe latter is easier to implement.\n\nThe tests should cover both the legacy behavior (exit code `0` when vulnerabilities are found) and the new one (non-zero exit code when vulnerabilities are found).\n\nAdditional tests are needed for when no vulnerabilities are found, to make sure that it exits with exit code `0`.\n\n### Other

Either of these may be open and listening when running GitLab in production, as they are on GitLab.com\n\nHere's a list of ones I've spotted so far. It's probably not comprehensive:\n\n* [gitlab-workhorse](workhorse/main.go#L84)\n* [gitlab-rails](config/initializers/7_prometheus_metrics.rb)\n* [gitlab-sshd](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/-/blob/main/cmd/gitlab-sshd/main.go#L60)\n* [gitlab-pages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/-/blob/master/main.go#L161)\n\nCurrently, none of these endpoints are capable of being TLS-secured. In a FIPS-compliant setup, I think we *must* TLS-secure them all.

Currently this function returns no error when the scan is successful, even if the generated JSON report contains vulnerabilities.\n\n[analyzers/command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/command) was extracted from [analyzers/common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common), and some analyzers still use this other repo.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Declare a new CLI flag and environment variable, to control the exit codes\n- Change the `Run` function so that it returns an error when vulnerabilities are found, depending on the aforementioned environment variable; make the error implement the `ExitCoder` interface of `urfave/cli` to communicate the exit code.\n- Fetch the exit code from map, using a constant specific to that scenario\n- Define exit code maps that correspond to the existing behavior and the new one\n- Switch between the exit code maps/tables based on the environment variable defined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324634#proposal\n\nA new Go package named `exitcodes` gathers all the code needed to throw the correct exit code, based on the environment variables. This package is used by the `command` package and by the analyzers that implement their own `run` command.\n\nTBD: Is `exitcodes` a new repo, or is it a sub-package of `command`?\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Create a new `exitcodes` package that contains:\n   - CLI flag for the exit codes version\n   - constants for the supported error cases, like \"vulnerabilities detected\"\n   - helper functions to resolve constants to errors to be returned, using the CLI context  \n- [ ] Update the `run` command in the `command` package\n   - include CLI flag exported by `exitcodes`\n   - use helper functions and constants exported by `exitcodes` to return the correct exit code when the generated report contains at least one vulnerabilities\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis will be tested in the integration tests of the Secure analyzers using the `common` library, when checking the exit code.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nThis is stage-wide.\n\n### Links / references\n\n- implementation plan: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324634#implementation-plan\n- @adamcohen's experiments: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324634#note_530145822\n- @gonzoyumo's proposal: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324634#note_530604706","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-16T19:43:50.677Z","updated_at":"2021-05-12T20:27:06.147Z","closed_at":"2021-04-07T22:19:00.309Z","closed_by":{"id":3913516,"username":"NicoleSchwartz","name":"Nicole Schwartz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3913516/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NicoleSchwartz"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","deprecation","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::feature","won't do","wontfix","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

I'm not keen on changing the headline of the popover, here is why:\n    \u003e\n    \u003e - We are duplicating information. The first piece of information you get with the widget is that you have 5 days left on your trial. Adding an extra \"5 days remaining\" in the popover headline feels redundant, and overusing scarcity can be perceived as \"pushy\".\n    \u003e - Since we've yet to launch the experiment, we should hold-off on extra scarcity for now. We can always iterate and experiment on copy if we feel it's the way to go (personally I don't, but happy to be proven wrong).\n    \u003e - From a learning perspective, it's probably better to start without this piece of copy, then add it and measure its impact. It's also why we started with a simple \"Hey there\" as a MVC.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e @s_awezec @aqualls Curious to get your thoughts on the points above.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e The rest of the copy is fine for me 👍\n\nWhich relates to the following discussion from #288015:\n\n- [ ] @aqualls started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288015#note_510491132) (7+ replies):\n\n    \u003e @kcomoli @dreedy I have some ideas here! Here's the current text:\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \u003e Hey there! :wave:\n    \u003e \u003e\n    \u003e \u003e Your trial ends on 2021-03-02. We hope you are enjoying GitLab Gold. To continue using GitLab Gold after your trial ends, you will need to buy a subscription. You can also choose GitLab Premium if its features are sufficient for your needs.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e I don't know how many of these changes we can make in this iteration, but a couple really jump out at me. Here's an idea:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e \u003e You've got 23 day\\[s\\] remaining on GitLab Gold! :wave:\n    \u003e \u003e\n    \u003e \u003e Your trial ends on 2021-03-02. We hope you're enjoying the features of GitLab Gold. To keep those features after your trial ends, you'll need to buy a subscription. (You can also choose GitLab Premium if it meets your needs.)\n    \u003e \n    \u003e * The \"Hey there\" line will be the most read line. Let's put our most important information there, but don't do it this way if we can't differentiate between \"1 day\" and \"2 days\" because that always makes me :face_palm_tone2: when I see something like \"You have 1 days remaining.\"\n    \u003e * Can we translate dates into friendlier language? (I don't know how much work this entails.) There's no single date format that will make everyone happy, but in this case, the timeline is so short that the year is implied. Maybe \"March 2\" instead of 2021-03-02?\n    \u003e * Hammer home features, features, features. What the user gets in GitLab Gold are features. (Could we link to them too?)\n    \u003e * +1 to the \"meets your needs\" instead of \"sufficient\"\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Thoughts?

You use the user interface to view, validate and (sometimes) troubleshoot those dependencies. But have you ever found yourself filtering the registry based on name or type and then tried to share a link with your teammate? You can't do it. That means that your teammate had to manually search/filter the registry to recreate the same view as you.

We support lots of different stores, and various categories of files can be uploaded, but a particular combination is LFS objects stored in Amazon S3.\n\nThere are two different ways to configure uploads in this case, and both use MD5 checksums to verify data integrity - we can either configure object storage in workhorse (which uses a native S3 client), or we can configure it in gitlab-rails (which then uses a generic http client in workhorse).\n\nPer https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/295923#note_530773748 , neither of these approaches is currently FIPS-compliant. There does seem to be an easy way to make the former FIPS-compliant - we \"just\" have to configure the native S3 client to not use MD5 checksums.\n\nWe might need to leave the other in place indefinitely, to support object stores that only work with MD5 hashes. I don't know, but do suspect, that self-managed NetApp appliances might fall into this category, for instance.\n\nIdeally, we'd be able to detect when running in FIPS mode and refuse uploads that rely on MD5 functionality in workhorse, to help guide people to FIPS-compliant setups. Unlike Ruby + OpenSSL, the Go implementation of MD5 doesn't raise an error when activated in FIPS mode.\n\nWe should also pay attention to the other (non-S3) clients we're using with the workhorse native object store integration.

Fail silently if this attempt also fails.\n\u003e 1. When the user opens the `Apply suggestions` dropdown, try fetching again. If it fails, just display the default commit message with the variables and show a message similar to `Unable to correctly show the default commit message.

In the following example, the user in question is listed on the `seat usage` page despite not belonging to any subgroups or projects.\n\n* [Zendesk (Internal)](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/198880)\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to the seat usage page and search for a user to remove\n2. Use the `Remove User` option to remove the billable member\n3. Observe the `user was successfully removed` message\n4. Refresh and confirm the user still exists as a billable member\n\n#### Example Project\n\nNOTE: I was unable to replicate this with a test user added to a test project.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen a billable member is removed via the Seat Usage page, the billable member remains listed on the seat usage page despite confirmation that it was removed.\n\n#### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen a billable member is removed via the Seat Usage page, it should no longer be listed on the Seat Usage page and should be removed from all subgroups/projects.\n\n#### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n* [Kibana Logs (Internal)](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/c9ea85cbbf5078409e1b26a4cb280397)\n\nNote: The logs show an API call to `DELETE` the billable member. However, the member in question remains in both the UI and the [Members API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#remove-a-billable-member-from-a-group).\n\n#### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?

dependency exports returned by multi-project Java builds (gemnasium-maven)","description":"## Summary\n\n`gemnasium-maven` is currently unaware of multi-project Java builds, and multi-project builds are supported by doing the following:\n1. find all supported build files, with no distinction b/w root projects and their sub-projects\n1. iterate collected build files, pass each of them to the compatible builder, and make the builder exit right away if there's already a dependency export for the build file\n\nThis (mostly) works because:\n* building the root project has the side-effect of building its children, and creating dependency exports for them \n* the build file of the root project is processed _before_ the build files of its children, because of the way the project finder walks the scanned directory\n\n`gemnasium-maven` should be changed so that the dependency exports of a multi-project builds are listed when building the root project, instead of recursively finding build files and dependency exports matching these. This would be simpler, and more accurate. Also, it becomes possible to track the name of the sub-project where a dependency was detected.\n\n## Proposal\n\nchange `gemnasiumm-maven` so that:\n- builders extract the output of the command that builds the root project, and return a list of all the dependency exports it creates\n  - Gemnasium Maven plugin\n  - Gemnasium Gradle plugin\n  - sbt-dependency-graph; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/107\n- all the dependency exports returned by a multi-project build are scanned\n- only the root project is found by the `Finder`\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n* [x] change builders in `gemnasium-maven`\n   - [x] change the `Builder` interface so that the `Build` function can return the dependency exports for the sub-projects, along with the dependency export for the root project https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/107\n   - [x] update `sbt` builder: parse output of `sbt` and extract paths of DOT exports https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/107\n   - [x] change the `Analyze` function so that additional exports returned by the builders are all processed https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/107 \n   - [x] update `maven` builder: parse output of Gemnasium Maven plugin and extract paths of JSON exports\n   - [x] update `gradle` builder: parse output of Gemnasium Gradle plugin and extract paths of JSON exports\n   - [x] change `finder` configuration and force the search mode to `SearchSingleDir`; the preset will be updated later on\n* ~~simplify `finder`~~; this will be done as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292952\n   - in `gemnasium`, remove [`SearchSingleTree`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.2/finder/finder.go#L22) mode and change `gemnasium-maven`'s preset to `SearchSingleDir`\n   - update `gemnasium` dependency in `gemnasium-maven`, and revert changes to the preset\n\nNOTE: This introduces a discrepancy between the `Builder` defined in gemnasium-maven with the one defined in `gemnasium` and `gemnasium-maven`, but this will be addressed when moving the code of `gemnasium-maven` to `gemnasium`. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292952\n\n## Improvements\n\n- code is simplified, in particular the [finder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/finder/finder.go)\n- gemnasium-maven and gemnasium-python are further aligned and both use the `finder.SearchSingleDir` search mode\n- code is easier to debug; it no longer inspects directories that are not part of the multi-project build\n\n## Risks\n\n- The location of vulnerabilities detected in sub-projects might change, resulting in the loss of vulnerability feedback.\n- The `dependency_files[].path` for the sub-projects might change, in the report. This would only change the Dependency List page though.\n- Dependencies of the sub-projects might merged into the dependencies of the root project, the `dependency_files` field of the report.\n- In case their are multiple root projects in a repo, the new implementation might pick a different one. That said, there are no specs to establish what root project the analyzer should pick and scan.\n\n## Involved components\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\nSub-projects can be scanned as long as they have a dependency file export, even if there's no build file is detected in the directory of the sub-project. This fixes a bug where Gradle sub-projects are skipped if the build file name isn't `build.gradle`. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322346\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e\n\n/cc @ifrenkel @gonzoyumo @adamcohen","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-15T10:02:01.267Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T17:02:30.934Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T15:17:59.692Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324626","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":7},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"7 of 7 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324626","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324626/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324626/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#324626","relative":"#324626","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324626"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":80921756,"iid":324623,"project_id":278964,"title":"Clarify and document usage of `WAU` acronym in metrics definitions","description":"Metric description `Count of WAU making epics confidential`\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56483/diffs#7944ea598b78a4e762f3b723ddc8674a1627f6ef_0_6\n\nThe following discussion from !56483 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @alinamihaila started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56483#note_529219665): \n\n    \u003e I think this is the first time we use `WAU` acronym.

(Background and context)\n\n[There is a proposal open to rearchitect the MR Widgets mergeability logic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300042). Doing so will accomplish many goals, but we need to understand the best path forward technically.\n\nThe initial proposal suggests:\n- Run mergeability checks one after the other with a success or failure response with details, which may require refactor work\n- Different teams own these different checks, empowering code ownership\n- Return this object to the frontend to display the errors, versus the method we use today\n\n#### What hypotheses and/or assumptions do you have?\n\nThe assumption is that this work can be iterated upon so as to **not** introduce risk and/or breaking changes to the current way we have today. An additional assumption is that the proposal outlined is the best solution, and we are outlining what work that will entail.\n\n#### What questions must be answered?\n1.

Add tests for the Vue component added in the Step 1:\n    - e.g. `spec/frontend/repository/components/blob_viewers/{viewer-name}_viewer_spec.js`\n\n### How to setup and validate locally (strongly suggested before assigning a reviewer)\n\nThis feature is behind the `:refactor_blob_viewer` feature flag.\n\n1. Run `rails c` in the project root.\n1. Run `Feature.enable(:refactor_blob_viewer)` in the rails console.\n1. Upload the appropriate file type.\n1. View the newly uploaded file and ensure that it works as expected.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-12T12:35:52.711Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T20:46:56.764Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T20:46:56.753Z","closed_by":{"id":181229,"username":"leipert","name":"Lukas 'Eipi' Eipert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/19a1f1260fa70323f35bc508927921a2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/leipert"},"labels":["Hackathon","Seeking community contributions","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::source code","repository","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324334","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324334","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324334/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324334/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#324334","relative":"#324334","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324334"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5531,"epic":{"id":217419,"iid":5531,"title":"Refactor Repository Browser to 1 Vue Application","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5531","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e3\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
