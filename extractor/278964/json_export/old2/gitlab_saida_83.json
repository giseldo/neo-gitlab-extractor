Because these dashboards look and behave almost exactly the same and differ only in what level of vulnerabilities are shown, we should combine them into one common component and use `props` to configure what is shown. Otherwise, any work that needs to be done in one of the components will need to be duplicated across the other two, for example [this MR where the same `watch()` block needed to be copied 3 times](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53934#note_506590184).\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Combine the 3 dashboard components into one common component.\n- [x] Combine the 3 setup components into one common component.\n- [ ] If possible, combine the common dashboard component into the common setup component.\n- [ ] If possible, combine everything into `vulnerability_list.vue`.\n\nNote that it may be possible to merge all 6 components in the top two layers into the already-existing `vulnerability_list.vue` component, then use `props` to pass in the correct GraphQL query and show/hide the counts.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-17T06:33:32.290Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:00:06.716Z","closed_at":"2021-04-27T08:25:54.372Z","closed_by":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel

The first setting we will support is delayed project deletion. \n\n### Proposal \n\nComplete hardening of the feature for GA release\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/51498 for ~backend POC. The code is not quite production ready. \n\n- Migrations were messy and need to be updated after https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53916 is merged. \n- Needs tests.\n- Needs developer documentation on using `lockable_attrs` and the associated database migrations (lock column, can be null, etc). \n- Document `CascadingNamespaceAttribute` so the code is clear to future developers.

Recently we've introduced a new feature group called \"Security \u0026 Compliance\" which works as a roof feature for security and compliance-related features. It's there to make it easier to switch off all the related features by using the project visibility settings. All the \"Security \u0026 Compliance\" related features require by default the developer access therefore the default feature setting has been set as `PRIVATE`. But because of the change here, it is now breaking some tests as now we require users to have access to private features to use the template.\n\nI wanted to ask you as you've authored on this change; can't we just check the feature access while exporting the data of related features? If there are other problems with that approach, I will introduce a change like the following one as we are not exporting \"Security \u0026 Compliance\" related data yet.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git

with data\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CwChRvItO64e7OmDnUqLgOXjt61MUDGJcRtICGLo7-Q/edit\n\n- It has three tabs: \"Vue\", \"HTML\" (Vue + HAML), and \"Raw JS\".\n- \"Vue\" tab has two additional columns, \"uses data\" (`TRUE` if there is a `tracking` Vue property) and \"uses directive\" (`TRUE` if using the directive tracking wrapper); these two gives us insights about preferred usage.\n- \"HTML\" has an additional \"HTML tag\" column that holds the element that fires the event. This is important because this method dispatches the event on `click`, `show.bs.dropdown` or `hide.bs.dropdown`. With dropdowns, it fires the event when opening and closing, adding `_show` or `_hide` to the action string correspondingly. If the [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) has a value property, it's used as the `value` for the event.\n- Fields that use variables are wrapped into square brackets (`[variableName]`).\n- Fields that have an optional value are prefixed with a ? (`?[mightBeEmpty]`)\n- Fields that have values separated by pipes are [ENUM-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) fields (`on | off | n/a`)\n\n\n### Conclusions\n\n- All tracking calls are pointing to the [Tracking](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/tracking.js) class.\n- Usage is not wrong, but there are cases with some invalid [`trackStructEvent` properties](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow.html#structured-event-taxonomy).\n- Events fired using *Raw JS* takes more liberties. The second place would be the *Vue directive*. Events fired using *data-attributes* and *mixins* seem to respect the taxonomy more.\n- A good topic for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/10480 would be \"How to fix invalid event payloads\", and some of the questions to answer might be (we should clarify this to the docs as well):\n    - What is the naming convention for `action`?\n    - Is `category` a namespace?\n    - Is `label` the name of `property`?\n    - Is `property` the name of `value`?\n    - What can `value` hold?\n\n#### Methods used for tracking\n| FROM   | METHOD               | METHOD DEFINITION
