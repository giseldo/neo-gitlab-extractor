See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231725#note_413595037 for more information. \n\n## Requirements \n\nWe have to include the Rich Text Editor 3rd party dependencies in the GitLab application while meeting the following expectations\n\n### Performance\n\n- We want to load these dependencies asynchronously.\n- If the dependencies are not updated, we want to maintain them in the web browser’s cache.\n  To meet this expectation, the bundle where the dependencies is distributed should be independent from the bundle where the Rich Text Editor is located. The reason is that we will update the Rich Text Editor more often than its dependencies.\n\n### Smooth transition to TipTap v2\n\nThe methodology we use to load the dependencies should not become a hindrance  for the transition from TipTap 1 to TipTap 2 (currently in private development).\n\nTo meet this expectation. We should be aware of the differences between TipTap 1 and TipTap 2 distribution. [TipTap 1 groups all its dependencies](https://tiptap.dev/docs/guide/editor.html) and core components in two packages: `tiptap` and `tiptap-extensions`. \n\n```html\n\u003cscript\u003e\nimport { Editor, EditorContent } from 'tiptap';\nimport { Bold } from 'tiptap-extensions';\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    EditorContent,\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      editor: new Editor({\n        content: '\u003cp\u003eInitial editor content\u003c/p\u003e',\n        extensions: [\n          new Bold(),\n        ],\n      })\n    }\n  },\n  beforeDestroy() {\n    this.editor.destroy()\n  },\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003ceditor-content :editor=\"editor\" /\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nTipTap 2 distributes extensions and Vue components in different packages.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'\nimport Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'\nimport Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'\nimport Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'\n\nnew Editor({\n  element: document.querySelector('.element'),\n  extensions: [\n    Document,\n    Paragraph,\n    Text,\n  ],\n  content: '\u003cp\u003eExample Text\u003c/p\u003e',\n  autofocus: true,\n  editable: true,\n  injectCSS: false,\n})\n```\n\n## Implementation guide\n\n- Encapsulate the responsibility of loading tiptap packages in a single factory function. The advantage of putting all import calls in a single place is that we will only have to replace TipTap 1 packages with TipTap 2 packages in that location. \n- Put all tiptap packages in the same bundle using [webpack module methods](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/)\n\n![image](/uploads/2ee4e83fa0ea1f3d4713aabfd01b6a14/image.png)\n\n## Context\n\nSee for a big picture of the Rich Text Editor development: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321442","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-22T19:26:28.242Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T20:05:53.967Z","closed_at":"2021-03-10T13:24:16.251Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"labels":["devops::create","frontend","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"}],"author":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323764","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323764","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323764/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323764/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#323764","relative":"#323764","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#323764"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79579432,"iid":322485,"project_id":278964,"title":"Pipeline editor -

This issue if for considering how that would work/look.\n\n### Proposal\n\n| Combine title, assignee and incident columns and introduce labels to it | Introduce severity and label filters to existing filter bar | Introduce bulk actions | Adding labels to alert detail page | Error message |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Alert_list](/uploads/873a07f26d1c13336dcd7009b6b1b6cf/Alert_list.png) | ![Alert_list-1](/uploads/cd22fd1f74f4532a9a0ee5fed97826d0/Alert_list-1.png) | ![Alert_list-2](/uploads/ff610c738277dc885397d66cae7c874c/Alert_list-2.png) | ![Alert_detail_-_MVC_version](/uploads/69587060d8edd1cfd9dc588dfdd3b2bf/Alert_detail_-_MVC_version.png) | ![Alert_list__2_](/uploads/feb1415656043d37a7f2e04a433e5d22/Alert_list__2_.png)|\n\nNotes:\n- For the bulk actions interaction, we can follow what's been done for the current [Vulnerability Report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/security/vulnerability_report). There, once you select an item, an additional filter bar appears that displays the bulk action dropdown. The design looks a little bit different as it follows the latest design updates for bulk actions. But, the interaction would be the same, for now.\n- If there are additional labels, they would wrap within that first column, and the height of the row would increase to accommodate them.\n- If labels have been added to an alert, and the alert is promoted to an incident, the labels should be added automatically to the incident.\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/GlT6Lcm2c9fvMmrXUGHElB/Re-work-alerts-list-gitlab-com-and-322468?node-id=1%3A79)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-22T16:40:51.660Z","updated_at":"2021-10-06T02:20:33.093Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T22:30:56.781Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["Technical Writing","UI text","UX","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322468","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322468","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322468/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322468/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322468","relative":"#322468","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322468"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5684,"epic":{"id":235098,"iid":5684,"title":"Alert list improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5684","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79570425,"iid":322467,"project_id":278964,"title":"Experiment cleanup: Trim-down the \"skip copy\" in the .com trial flow for non-GL users","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Experiment Name] Successful Cleanup --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis experiment has been deemed a success and is in the process of being rolled out to 100% of traffic.\nThe changes need to become an official part of the product.\n\n* Engineering issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284955\n* Experiment tracking issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284956\n* Feature Flag: `trimmed_skip_trial_copy`\n\n## Steps\n\n- [X] Determine whether the feature should apply to SaaS and/or self-managed\n  - SaaS trial experience only\n- [X] Determine whether the feature should apply to EE - and which tiers - and/or Core\n  - This experience only applies to net new SaaS trial sign-ups\n- [X] Determine if tracking should be kept as is, removed, or modified.\n  - Tracking should be kept (we always want to be able to monitor the trial 'skip rate')\n- [x] Migrate experiment to a default enabled [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/development.html) for one milestone and add a changelog.

They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nThe Security Configuration page is receiving lots of changes as part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4787, and also extended via https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4908 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263251.\n\nIn order to support this and ease future work, we'll refactor the page on both the ~frontend and ~backend. (See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322624.)\n\nTo increase confidence in these changes/refactorings, we should add [feature tests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/testing_levels.html#white-box-tests-at-the-system-level-formerly-known-as-system--feature-tests) for basic functionality/presentation.\n\nFinally, this is only about adding specs for ~\"GitLab Ultimate\" behaviour. While the Core page is currently a completely separate implementation, the eventual goal is to make these share as much code as possible. Writing feature specs for both I think might violate the guidelines laid out in the [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/testing_levels.html#white-box-tests-at-the-system-level-formerly-known-as-system--feature-tests).\n\n## Relevant links\n- [Feature specs docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/testing_levels.html#white-box-tests-at-the-system-level-formerly-known-as-system--feature-tests)\n\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\n- [-] Documentation:\n- [-] Feature flag:\n- [-] Performance:\n- [x] Testing: That's the only goal of this issue!

Have some project in GitHub you don't have in GitLab. (You don't actually have to complete the import so it can be a fake / blank project)\n1. Create a group or subgroup in GitLab, or find one you've already got to test with.\n1. In **Settings \u003e General \u003e Permissions, LFS, 2FA**, make sure **Allowed to create projects** is set to \"Developers + Maintainers\"\n1. Add someone as a developer to your group (make sure they don't have higher permissions in a parent group, they must have developer level)\n1. Have that developer user go to **New Project \u003e Import \u003e GitHub** and [pick an authentication method](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html#import-your-github-repository-into-gitlab) if not already connected. I tried with both access tokens and the OAuth integration and they both show the issue.\n1. Find your GitHub project in the list, and look at the dropdown to choose a namespace. \"Groups\" only shows groups where the user is a maintainer, and none of the ones where they can create projects with developer permission.\n\n### Example Project\n\nN/A, it's the creating/importing of a project that's the problem\n\nI did however replicate on GitLab.com using my basic team member permissions. I'm a developer of the `/gitlab-com` group as all GitLab team members are by default. I can select \"New project\" and choose to make a new random blank project in that namespace, but it does not appear in the dropdown if I want to import from GitHub. Only groups I am a maintainer of, such as the `gitlab-com/support` subgroup, were listed.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly groups where a user is a maintainer are listed in the dropdown when importing from GitHub.\nNone of the groups where they are a developer, but project creation is set to \"Developer + Maintainers\" are available.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nProjects that have \"Developers + Maintainers\" set to create projects where the user is a developer should be listed.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for screenshots\u003c/summary\u003e\nHere are my subgroup's settings, it's \"subgroup-b\" under \"parent-group-a\":\n\n![settings for \"can create projects\"](/uploads/d47be074a63da68686eb2fa9cdcb04cc/settings.png)\n\nHere are my group's test user members, one a developer and one a maintainer.\n\n![members of \"subgroup-b\"](/uploads/1fc2e3622ea55974aa0de3fc7ceb4d8a/members.png)\n\nThe maintainer is not a maintainer of any other groups.

For the developer user it returned an empty array. So I figured okay, I'll look at [that controller's code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.8.2-ee/app/controllers/import/available_namespaces_controller.rb). It seems to be calling this [managable groups with routes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.8.2-ee/app/models/user.rb#L1463-1467) method in the user model. That method has an option to return the developer maintainer access groups, but it defaults to false, and the AvailableNamespacesController doesn't seem to be sending in any override or anything.\n\nI confirmed in the rails console for my two test users that the one with maintainer access I can see the group by calling `User.find_by(username: 'maintuser').manageable_groups_with_routes`, but the developer I have to add the extra parameter to see it, so `User.find_by(username: 'devuser').manageable_groups_with_routes(include_groups_with_developer_maintainer_access: true)`. Without the extra parameter it returns an empty array.\n\nIs this intentional? Should we be checking for groups with maintainer developer access when importing? \n\n- If yes, we should check for those projects, then this is a bug and I think we just need to include that parameter.\n- If no, let me know and I can close this and update the docs to make sure that's clear!","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-22T15:34:44.965Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T13:10:36.359Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T10:01:33.163Z","closed_by":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Github","Importer:GitHub","Next Up","backend","customer","devops::manage","estimation::completed","frontend","group::import","milestone::p3","missed:14.2","section::dev","sup-eng-contrib-potential","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"}],"author":{"id":5461018,"username":"kchappell","name":"Kaitlyn Chappell","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/055da6acd1f2f9f5ceeefb4601d192e9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kchappell"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322459","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322459","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322459/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322459/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322459","relative":"#322459","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322459"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3050,"epic":{"id":39430,"iid":3050,"title":"🐞 GitHub Importer bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3050","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79560318,"iid":322449,"project_id":278964,"title":"On `New Issue` the description box says \"Write a comment\"","description":"## Description\n\nNoticed on `.com`\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-02-22_at_8.15.20_AM](/uploads/ce6e95e90b6dd5445e32a394a29e743a/Screen_Shot_2021-02-22_at_8.15.20_AM.png)\n\nI would expect this to say \"Write a description\" :sweat_smile:","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-22T14:16:50.408Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T19:06:40.676Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T19:06:40.655Z","closed_by":{"id":1646689,"username":"oregand","name":"David O'Regan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1646689/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/oregand"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly.

without waiting for a network request\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e.  \n\nCritically, the app would need partial loading states: when data has been populated, but the app is currently loading data that **could** change what's displayed. This may need to disallow commenting, for example, to avoid a user trying to leave a comment on a file or a line that doesn't exist in an updated version.\n\n## Implementation\n\nCreate a local database with IndexedDB that stores MR info and Diff File info (to start).\n\nThese two types of information are both uniquely identifiable: Diff Files are [IDed when they are loaded from the backend](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/utils/diff_file.js#L62), and MRs can be identified in a similar way using their user/group, project, number, and version.\n\nNew interceptors will be used to coordinate two potential data sources: the local database and the remote API request. Calls to the interceptor would **simultaneously** check the database for information\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e, and begin a load from the back end\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e. Because MR information (\"metadata\") and Diff File information can both be uniquely identified, these loads are inserted into the local database as soon as a network request completes - after they've been identified, but before any other data is added or removed from the payload.\n\nNote that there's no caveat to the load from the backend: since we don't have any expiration date for MR or Diff information, the front end must request an update from the back end.\n\n## Security\n\nSince this information is stored locally to a user, there is a risk of anything confidential being leaked.\n\nThere are many ways to avoid this, of increasing complexity:\n\n1. Delete everything in the database when a browser session ends\n    - This is the most obvious way to avoid leaking data, but would likely also remove most of the performance gains for repeat visits.\n1. Delete everything in the database when the user logs out\n    - This has the same problems as before, but may happen less frequently.\n    - In addition, there's still potential for leaked data, as a user may have a cached local copy of an issue that was public, but has been changed to confidential\n1. Never store anything marked confidential\n    - This may still leave once-public items turned confidential in the cache\n1. Encrypt the data stored in the database with a user's key\n\nIn any of these scenarios, we would also want to delete any data from the local database that the user cannot access. E.g., if an MR is switched to confidential and the user has a cached copy of the public versions of that MR, the next attempt to load that MR for that user that fails should delete all past copies of it.\n\nThere are undoubtedly even more potential security scenarios that should be fully explored before an implementation decision is made.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nIDB wrapper that turns the (extremely clunky, difficult to use) browser-native API into a promise-based abstraction: [DexieJS](https://dexie.org).\n\n----\n\n\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e: The assumption here is that the **majority** of page loads are to MRs already visited at least once. There will be no benefit when visiting MRs the user has never seen before.  \n\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e: The database check here will be for broad information like the current MR, not for specific information like the current version. This way it can load the latest version stored **in the database**, which may not be the latest version **that exists**.  \n\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e: Not only will this have an significant positive impact on the load times for the app, it will also lay most of the groundwork for a fully offline app, which would only require an additional Service Worker to intercept requests at the network layer.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-19T23:04:25.697Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T20:35:33.505Z","closed_at":"2021-06-04T17:52:11.580Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","bug::performance","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.11","missed:13.12","section::dev","spike","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"}],"author":{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322202","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322202","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322202/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322202/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322202","relative":"#322202","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322202"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79441413,"iid":322197,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update backend messages displayed for group migration failures","description":"### Problem description\n\nThis is a follow-up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300684#note_513391345\n\nWhen a group migration fails on the backend, a message is propagated to the frontend and displayed to the user. \n\n![image](/uploads/25d2efdd2455bc63e0d7e4f00eb74fb5/image.png)\n\nThe message reads `Validation failed: Destination namespace destination group cannot be part of the source group tree`.

open","description":"__Related__: Sidekiq jobs don't currently include client transaction timing metrics: this is documented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/894\n\n**EDIT** Also `BuildTraceChunkFlushWorker`, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336048\n\nThere is some evidence that `ArchiveTraceWorker` is holding client transactions open. \n\nWhen reviewing postgres activity in `pg_stat_activity`, and grouping by marginalia comments and state, we see that there are frequently a high number of open `ArchiveTraceWorker` active connections on the primary instance, with status of `idle in transaction`. \n\nObtained with:\n\n```console\n$ sudo gitlab-psql -c \"SELECT a.matches[1] AS application, coalesce(a.matches[6], concat_ws('#', a.matches[2], a.matches[3])) as endpoint, a.state, count(*) c FROM ( SELECT regexp_matches(query, '\\/\\*(?:application:(\\w+),?)(?:controller:(\\w+),?)?(?:action:(\\w+),?)?(?:correlation_id:(\\w+),?)(?:jid:(\\w+),?)?(?:job_class:([\\w:]+),?)?', 'g') AS matches, state FROM pg_stat_activity) a GROUP BY 1,2,3 ORDER BY 4 DESC, 1,2,3;\"\n```\n\n![image](/uploads/539cf46c010fc6467d486c1b54765d87/image.png)\n\nThis probably indicates that these transactions are being opened through `ActiveRecord::Base#transaction`. \n\nSince `ArchiveTraceWorker` is a high throughput endpoint, we should ensure that unless there is a very good reason, it doesn't use client transactions, and if we have to, that they are being held open for the minimum time possible.\n\ncc @abrandl @Finotto

The below is a list of things that need changing (though there may be more)!\n\n- [ ] Change any access from `this.line...` to `props.line`\n- [ ] Move the methods we have _up_ a component and pass them down as methods (or emit an event?)\n- [ ] Remove computed properties \u0026 move them onto the line object (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/fd23a0edd8e735ec8eace3a1cd3785febeda719f/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_row_utils.js#L91).\n- [ ] Remove Vuex state and getters and pass in as props (might not need them with the above?)\n- [ ] Something to try - move the `GlIcon` from here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9b66491045c9acdaff790bf16caba4c96fcf48de/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/diff_row.vue#L212 to be in CSS maybe? :shrug: \n\n## Improvements\n\nWhat do we gain from this? Well...\n\n**note:** these numbers came from a merge request with 105 files and 8668 additions.\n\nWe get a huge performance boost. From my very quick try locally (though it was messy...) we can from a TBT of approx 26s to approx 8s. I say approx because 1. the page kept locking up so the audits didn't always work and 2. I didn't fully to do the changes above, so numbers may be better or worse :shrug: \n\nThis would be the single biggest performance improvement that we have **EVER** had since the refactor of the diffs to Vue and this is only possible thanks to the unified diffs state and the unified diff components!\n\n/cc @andr3 Please schedule as soon as possible :see_no_evil:","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-19T12:24:48.066Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:59:55.126Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T11:34:17.573Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["devops::create","frontend","group::code review","section::dev","type::maintenance"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322130","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322130","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322130/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322130/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322130","relative":"#322130","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322130"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79408929,"iid":322127,"project_id":278964,"title":"License Scanning reports no license for some complex Gradle projects","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n**This has been closed in favor of 4 additional issues**\n\n1.

`members_with_parents.pluck('distinct user_id')`\n\n## Reason being:\n\nImagine your `user_id`  is `1` in the users table, and there is a group named `GitLabGroup` and imagine that you are explicitly added as a member of each of the following groups \n\n - the ancestor of the group `GitLabGroup`, \n - the  `GitLabGroup` group itself\n - and of a group that is shared with `GitLabGroup`.\n\n\nIf we execute, `GitLabGroup.user_ids_for_project_authorizations` , it would return an array of user ids, but with duplicate items included like `[1,1,1...]`\n\nand when it comes to project authroizations worker that uses these array of ids, `UserProjectAccessChangedService` enqueues multiple jobs but for these same ids.\n\nUsing `distinct` would make sure that we only enqueue one job per `user_id`, which would ofcourse helps us with enqueuing even fewe jobs than what we enqueue today when a project authorizations refresh  is triggered for a specific group, thus reducing the number of jobs in the queue, leading to better performance, fewer queries and lesser time taken for authorization refreshes to complete.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-19T04:54:39.974Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T17:35:47.707Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T06:33:32.790Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj

Within those projects, we did not identify any popular workflows that this change would break.\n\nThe parsing problem was identified in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207485, and our feature-flagged change was implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52644\n\nFor the configuration:\n\n```yaml\nparallel 02 17 2021 stuff:\n  script: echo $CI_NODEX_INDEX\n  parallel: 7\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n![image](/uploads/a847d18d6ceb50dc912260f7b704a361/image.png)\n\nWe will see:\n\n![image](/uploads/36043ad49d7365f1ccb1bfadb8582d9f/image.png)\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nSome customers who are expecting their jobs to be grouped with a very specific name might see them grouped under a different name. Also, jobs that may have been grouped before could show up as two separate groups. We believe this to be a small bug, as we only add parallelization suffixes to the end of build names. It's not impossible for someone to be expecting this incidental behavior.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can alse be useful to review --\u003e\n\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- All of gitlab.com, and wait for any bug reports that might be opened\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Update documentation as identified in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/301101\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`.

So if low privilege user DISABLE the maven repository then current packages in projects may be affected.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [pr1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8948569b-88da-4b8e-8bc2-da387af174b4/pr1.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-18T19:56:56.970Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T07:18:09.362Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T17:41:10.042Z","closed_by":{"id":4992072,"username":"dcouture","name":"Dominic Couture","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4992072/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dcouture"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-284","bug::vulnerability","devops::package","group::package registry","priority::3","section::ops","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-05-19","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322055","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322055","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322055/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322055/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322055","relative":"#322055","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322055"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7593,"epic":{"id":448592,"iid":7593,"title":"FY23-Q1 KR: Security vulnerability burndown - 100% reduction in past due","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7593","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79366546,"iid":322048,"project_id":278964,"title":"Multiple issues with Create Merge Request dropdown","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Create Merge Request dropdown has a few issues making it frustrating to use.\n\n#### 1) Typing a source branch name is difficult\nHere I am simply pressing backspace so I could attempt to type in a branch name that does not start with `m`. The autocompletion continues to insert a real `m` character and I can't erase the whole branch name.\n\n![backspacing](/uploads/264aa9a00d97605e045b8d0dcd3f52f2/backspacing.gif)\n\n#### 2) Not checking source branch validity in some cases\nSeems in some cases that the source branch validity is not checked when the source input is valid, preventing the creation of the merge request/branch. \n\n![source_not_available](/uploads/b0d3183b0c282d41362a7d17bdd463a6/source_not_available.gif)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n#### Summary item 1:\n1. Create an issue and click to open the merge request dropdown\n2. Attempt to delete the prepopulated `master` source branch\n\nIt seems that the input's value is being overwritten with the value at the time the check was sent to the server, even if other user input happened during that time.\n\n#### Summary item 2:\n1. Partially type in a branch name and let autocomplete finish it. Source will not be valid at this point w/ partially entered branch name.\n2. Click with the mouse to \"accept\" the autocompleted branch name. Entire branch name turns black.\n3. No check is performed, UI still indicates source branch is not valid and prevents creating mr/branch.\n\nPressing tab seems to trigger the correct behavior to accept the autocomplete suggestion + check source branch validity.\n\n### Example Project\n\nAny project can be used.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nExplained in Steps to Reproduce.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nSummary item 1: Do not overwrite user's input\n\nSummary item 2: Source branch validity is checked any time the concrete part (solid black characters, not grey autocomplete suggestion) of the input changes.\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\nN/A\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\nN/A\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-18T19:25:50.355Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T19:24:08.401Z","closed_at":"2022-04-13T19:24:07.944Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","priority::2","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Unfortunately, this API does not provide all the information required to make a full migration from one instance to another. To fix that, ~\"group::import\" is evolving the GraphQL API every time a missing information/relation is found.\n\n## Problem to Solve\n\nAdding new fields/relations to the GraphQL restricts the migration tool compatibility to only the versions that include the new fields/relations.\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n1. Given a group type in graphql was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/f5c7c3b9ae8b91662830f46b595ce1512050be89) in %\"11.11\" that allows us to migrate group attributes, subgroups, etc.\n1. A minimum overall version for our tool is v11.11.0 that allows to import just that.\n1. You recently made a change to epics query to add `includeDescendantGroups: false`  attributes, in %\"13.7\". This means that any graphql request we make to instance that is %\"13.6\" or less will result in a syntax error. This puts a version dependency of %\"13.7\" for epics.\n1. Similar thing can be done for other Migration Pipelines. The newer the version the more complete a migration is going to be.\n1. Each query module (e.g. GetEpicsQuery) would need to have an minimum_version (or a similar name) method that returns a version in which it was introduced/updated\n1.

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWe introduced the ability to set the project_limit and can_create_groups attributes on users created via SAML. This does not cover users created via SCIM or updates to these values if they are changed later in the IdP.\n\n### Proposal \n\nWe should allow updates to these values for all Enterprise users with the data received in the subsequent SAML response. With each SAML response, we should get the latest values from the IdP and update the user in GitLab. This ensures that the IdP is the source of truth for this information.\n\n#### Refinement assessment\n\nChanges will be isolated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/gitlab/auth/group_saml/user.rb, probably in the `find_and_update!` method. The `#save` method passes the `gl_user` object to the `Users::UpdateService` so we should update those attributes on `gl_user` before save.\n\n**NOTE:** ONLY do this for users who's attribute `provisioned_by_group_id` is set and matches the group they're signing in to. We shouldn't update attributes if the user wasn't provisioned by the current group. \n\nNote: We should verify that `find_and_update` is indeed called when a user is sent through the auth flow after the 1 day session expiry. I *think* they are. If not, it could cause the code location to change slightly, but still within this class probably.\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager).
