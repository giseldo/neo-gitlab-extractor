There are some interesting challenges though:\n\n- The service worker needs to be loaded in a separate unauthenticated domain. How can it make requests to file data then?\n- What happens when someone has two IDE's open? Do service workers effect the entire browser session or just that tab? Is there a way we can scope the worker to the specific ide session?\n\n##

([no code changes required](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218403#note_670281041))\n\n## Background\n\n**[HackerOne report #874401](https://hackerone.com/reports/874401)** by `jobert` on 2020-05-14, assigned to @cmaxim:\n\nI was digging through the `gitlab-foss`  repository and noticed an interested pattern that seems to be adopted in a few places: the use of `Forwardable` with meta-programming over delegators, explicit `attr_reader` methods or `method_missing`. Heads up: the arbitrary file read vulnerability I demonstrate in this report isn't currently exploitable. I was somewhat hesitant to submit this, but I think it'd be a good refactor nonetheless. Before diving into the vulnerability, I'd like to start by describing Ruby's `Forwardable` module behavior in combination with `def_delegators`.\n\nBefore Ruby 2.5.1, delegators could be implemented using the `delegate` or `method_missing` methods. It would look something like this:\n\n```ruby  \nclass HelloWorld  \n  def initialize(attributes)  \n    [@]options = OpenStruct.new(attributes)  \n  end\n\n  def say_it  \n    \"Hello world\"  \n  end\n\n  def method_missing(method, *args)  \n    [@]options.send(method, *args)  \n  end  \nend  \n```\n\nWhen a method would be called on a `HelloWorld` instance that wouldn't exist, it would pass it along to the `[@]options` instance variable.\n\n```ruby  \nHelloWorld.new({}).say_it  \n# =\u003e \"Hello world\"\n\nHelloWorld.new(hello: \"world\").hello  \n# =\u003e \"world\"\n\nHelloWorld.new(say_it: \"Not hello world\").say_it  \n# =\u003e \"Hello world\"  \n```\n\nBecause the `say_it` method is already defined on the class, its behavior won't be overridden when passing `say_it` to the initializer.\n\nThis class can be refactored to use the `Forwardable` method and `def_delegators`:\n\n```ruby  \nclass HelloWorld  \n  extend Forwardable\n\n  def initialize(attributes)  \n    [@]options = OpenStruct.new(attributes)\n\n    self.class.instance_eval do  \n      def_delegators :[@]options, *attributes.keys  \n    end  \n  end\n\n  def say_it  \n    \"Hello world\"  \n  end  \nend  \n```\n\nAt first glance, this seems like it has the same behavior as the first code example; but there's one crucial difference: **because the delegators are meta-programmed after the class was loaded, it can overwrite existing methods**:\n\n```ruby  \nHelloWorld.new({}).say_it  \n# =\u003e \"Hello world\"\n\nHelloWorld.new(hello: \"world\").hello  \n# =\u003e \"world\"\n\nHelloWorld.new(say_it: \"Not hello world\").say_it  \n# =\u003e \"Not hello world\"  \n#        ^------------------ The method is overwritten  \n```\n\nAs can be seen in the above example, the `say_it` method is overwritten when passing it to the initializer.\n\nGoing back to GitLab's main Ruby repository, there are a number of places where the `Forwardable` module is used. One place in particular stands out: `Gitlab::ImportExport::AfterExportStrategies::BaseAfterExportStrategy`. This class is a base class used for:\n\n* `Gitlab::ImportExport::AfterExportStrategies::MoveFileStrategy`  \n* `Gitlab::ImportExport::AfterExportStrategies::DownloadNotificationStrategy`  \n* `Gitlab::ImportExport::AfterExportStrategies::WebUploadStrategy`\n\n```ruby  \n# frozen_string_literal: true\n\nmodule Gitlab  \n  module ImportExport  \n    module AfterExportStrategies  \n      class BaseAfterExportStrategy  \n        extend Gitlab::ImportExport::CommandLineUtil  \n        include ActiveModel::Validations  \n        extend Forwardable\n\n        # ...\n\n        def initialize(attributes = {})  \n          [@]options = OpenStruct.new(attributes)\n\n          self.class.instance_eval do  \n            def_delegators :[@]options, *attributes.keys  \n          end  \n        end\n\n        # ...\n\n        def archive_path  \n          project.import_export_shared.archive_path  \n        end\n\n        # ...  \n      end  \n    end  \n  end  \nend  \n```\n\nThe `MoveFileStrategy` and `WebUploadStrategy` classes overwrite the initializer method or declare its arguments, so these don't meta-program the arguments on the class or limit what can be delegated. My worry, and the potential security vulnerabilities, is that if a new strategy would be declared that inherits from the `BaseAfterExportStrategy` without overwriting the initializer, it may give attackers the ability to change the behavior of existing methods.\n\nAs an example, let's say the `DownloadNotificationStrategy` class would be initialized with a user-inputted hash: if the user would specify the `archive_path` argument, it could overwrite the method and point it to a different archive on the local system. Same for the `WebUploadStrategy`: if the `initialize` method would be removed today, specs would still pass, but suddenly a security vulnerability would be present if the user could give it arbitrary arguments (same thing, overwrite the `archive_path`).\n\nI know that this isn't the security vulnerabilities you typically receive from me, but after reading the code, I felt it was the right thing to do to warn you about the potential security vulnerabilities that could be introduced in the future.\n\nThis is based on the `master` branch as of May 13, 2020.\n\n# Recommendation  \nGiven that there are only three classes inheriting from the base class, I'd rewrite the code like this to avoid trouble in the future (untested).

Deprecate `sourced_pipelines` in bridge/job in favour of `sourced_pipeline`","description":"## Problem\n\nThe relation `has_many :sourced_pipelines` defined in `Ci::Bridge` and `Ci::Build` is not correct because a job can only trigger 1 downstream pipeline. This could cause confusion as well as data inconsistency if we ever end up having multiple downstream pipelines for a given job. This data inconsistency was in fact experienced recently in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205705 and contributed to a major issue on production.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe have introduced `has_one :sourced_pipeline` in `Ci::Bridge` as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31370 to make explicit that `bridge` `has_one :downstream_pipeline`.\n\nWe should move the relation to `Ci::Processable`, so that both bridge and build have 1 sourced pipeline, and deprecate `sourced_pipelines` relationship.\n\n## Update \\[2022-12-01\\]\n\nThe [removal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/103980 \"Remove `has_many: sourced_pipelines` association in CI bridge/build job\") of the `has_many :sourced_pipelines` relationship caused a regression (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384053) as it was discovered that some customers are triggering multiple downstream pipelines from a single `Build` job via the API (using `CI_JOB_TOKEN`).\n\nWe reverted the [removal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/103980 \"Remove `has_many: sourced_pipelines` association in CI bridge/build job\") and decided to:\n\n```\nMaintain this difference between trigger (1 downstream pipeline) and builds (many downstream pipelines).\n```\n\n## New Solution\n\nRemove the `has_many :sourced pipelines` relationship for **only** `Bridge` jobs, and have the change made behind a `feature flag` for safe measure.\n\n## Implementation\n\n| ~backend | Ref |\n|----------|-----|\n| Move has_one

This would require one to also add the [Personal/project access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html#personalproject-access-tokens) to authenticate the request while configuring the [Webhook](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#overview):\n\n* Navigate to **Settings ➔ Webhooks**\n* Add the Webhook URL\n\n```\nhttps://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/:id/mirror/pull?private_token=\u003cyour_access_token\u003e\n```\n* Ensure that the Push Events checkbox is selected\n\n![image](/uploads/6c28d12dc433705d9fa069520b73d551/image.png)\n\n* Click on **Add Webhook** to save the web hook.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAfter saving the new Webhook is saved and shown below. As can be seen, the private token is also shown and is not encrypted. \n\n![Screenshot_2020-05-19_at_16.27.39](/uploads/ab3503442cea866e556d6c4078414945/Screenshot_2020-05-19_at_16.27.39.png)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Web token should be encrypted and not easily visible from the Web UI.\n\n![Screenshot_2020-05-19_at_17.44.42](/uploads/147b619a622bb03393312f82e6c328ba/Screenshot_2020-05-19_at_17.44.42.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-19T11:55:04.022Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T18:23:26.695Z","closed_at":"2022-05-02T22:50:52.780Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"labels":["Category:Webhooks","SUS::Impacting","Stretch","UI polish","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","backend-weight::4","customer","devops::manage","frontend","frontend-weight::1","group::integrations","personal access tokens","priority::4","section::dev","security","settings","severity::4","type::feature","vintage","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5532616,"username":"swainaina","name":"Silvester Wainaina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5532616/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/swainaina"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218389","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218389","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218389/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218389/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218389","relative":"#218389","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218389"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34719215,"iid":218365,"project_id":278964,"title":"Pages access_control doesn't respect the global settings","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nPages are publically accessible by default when `force_pages_access_control` is set to `true`.\n\nPages access_control on the creation of the project is set to:\n\n`access_control: !project.public_pages?`\n\nWhich doesn't take into consideration the global setting:\n\n`::Gitlab::Pages.access_control_is_forced?`\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCouldn't reproduce, but a [Premium ZD client (internal link)](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/156188) is able to reproduce this every time at their instance.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe Pages are publically accessible even when a project is private **and** `force_pages_access_control` is set to `true`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Pages are only accessible to logged-in users for private projects, and in all cases, if `force_pages_access_control` is set to `true`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs -

Some questions arise from this: Should we save that the alert was dismissed? Is that a normal pattern at GitLab? If so, is this saved per-browser in session storage? I assume this isn't the kind of thing saved per user (and saved in the DB), but perhaps?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-19T03:23:17.666Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T09:41:23.756Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T04:56:02.613Z","closed_by":{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo

goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCommenting on a single line is great for simple kinds of code review feedback, but frequently a comment is actually addressing multiple lines in the diff, perhaps a portion of a logic block, a paragraph of prose or an entire function. This forces users to chose a single line to provide feedback, but the feedback may in fact be resolved with a change to a different line.\n\nThe drop down introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211255 is a great MVC, but it still presents some cognitive overload to the user as they have to match the code they want to include with the line number the code is on.\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nVery easy to define an interval of a comment in an MR from the MR diffs view.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen highlighting multiple lines in diff, offer one comment bubble to comment on the range\n\n![CleanShot_2020-10-27_at_16.43.55](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/eb8fe977730c0df37330e43ef185147d/CleanShot_2020-10-27_at_16.43.55.gif)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eold proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nClicking and dragging is an accepted and learned pattern. \n\nRange selection is by performed by clicking the start of the range, and shift clicking the end of the range. This is consistent with typical text/range selection patterns.\n\n1. **Click** the line number of the first or last line of the range\n1. **Shift-Click** the line number of the last or first line of the range respectively or **drag** to final line number.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n* selecting over collapsed regions: *Optional.* Support will likely eventually added, but the there is no requirement for this in the first iteration.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nFinal implementation might depend on further discussions with ~UX during development and review.\n\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\nUpdate documentation of MR Multi Line comments to address the final state of funcionality.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n- Click-and-drag actions tend to be flaky when automated, so if a feature spec is added it might be wise to run it several times in CI before merging to be confident it's stable.\n- If there's no feature spec a simple E2E test should be added (@mlapierre can do that).\n- [ ] Run `package-and-qa` to confirm no other commenting-related QA tests are affected.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nEasy to add a comment spanning multiple lines. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-18T17:37:59.572Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:49:57.993Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T17:51:11.777Z","closed_by":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Category:Source Code Management","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","design-weight::3","devops::create","direction","frontend","group::code review","missed-deliverable","missed:13.6","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

In other words, the user will not now that the processing ended up in error. Packages that are still to be processed by the worker don't appear in the GitLab UI.

Those who manage work via timeboxes such as iterations need a way to see contextual information about what is being worked on across the entire iteration. \n\n### Proposal\n\n- Status, Start/End Dates, [Button-Ellipsis](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#ellipsis) to expose Edit/Archive\n- Title, Description, % Complete (Completed / Scope) which is dynamic based on the unit of value the report is filtered upon, Days Remaining\n- Burndown Chart, Burnup Chart filterable by Issue Count, Issue Weight, Issue Time. \n- Simple issue list that displays all issues in a given iteration ordered by In Progress (Open + Assigned), Open, Closed. \n\n![Basic View](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/48e4256bdacb896d1667bdc1b86fb11b/Screen_Shot_2020-05-26_at_5.36.59_PM.png)\n\n### Technical Considerations\n\n- Create a Vue app for the report view. \n- Keep the Vue app extensible so we can backport it to the Milestone view. The goal is to have a single Vue app for all timebox report views. \n- Consider pagination from the start for the Issue List. \n\n### What is not in scope for this MVC\n\n- The \"Group By\" scoping behavior. For the MVC, let's just create a simple issue list (follow on MVC).\n- The \"Start Iteration\" behavior. When creating an Iteration, you already define start and end dates. \n- Inherited iteration report (follow on MVC).

MR shows 500 error if the source project was deleted","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen trying to edit an MR of which the source project was already deleted, GitLab returns 500 error.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n - Create a project.\n - Fork it to a different namespace or group.\n - Create a branch, push something and submit an MR from the fork.\n - Go back to original project and merge MR (with delete source branch option enabled).\n - Delete the fork (source of MR) project.\n - Now, try to edit the MR from original project. It will give 500 error.\n\n### Example Project\n\nCould not reproduce this on GitLab.com. Though, I have created [this project](https://gitlab.com/psureshbabu/mr-test) for testing. Not sure if editing MR is working because the source project is still not hard deleted (which is now pending for deletion).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitLab returns 500 error while attempting to edit an MR of which the source project was deleted.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUser should be able to edit the MR.\nIf this should not be allowed, at least a helpful message must be shown.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nLog:\n \n```\n==\u003e /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/production.log \u003c==\nStarted GET \"/sw/aksjdhkjas/-/merge_requests/2/edit\" for 10.20.0.1 at 2020-05-18 05:43:16 +0000\nProcessing by Projects::MergeRequestsController#edit as HTML\n  Parameters: {\"namespace_id\"=\u003e\"sw\", \"project_id\"=\u003e\"aksjdhkjas\", \"id\"=\u003e\"2\"}\nCompleted 500 Internal Server Error in 156ms (ActiveRecord: 8.8ms | Elasticsearch: 0.0ms | Allocations: 179691)\n\nActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `empty_repo?' for nil:NilClass):\n     8:     %label\n     9:       = _('Merge options')\n    10:   .col-sm-10\n    11:     - if issuable.can_remove_source_branch?(current_user)\n    12:       .form-check.append-bottom-default\n    13:         = hidden_field_tag 'merge_request[force_remove_source_branch]', '0', id: nil\n    14:         = check_box_tag 'merge_request[force_remove_source_branch]', '1', issuable.force_remove_source_branch?, class: 'form-check-input'\n\napp/models/protected_branch.rb:24:in `protected?'\napp/models/merge_request.rb:936:in `can_remove_source_branch?'\napp/views/shared/issuable/form/_merge_params.html.haml:11\napp/views/shared/issuable/_form.html.haml:38\napp/views/projects/merge_requests/_form.html.haml:3\napp/views/projects/merge_requests/_form.html.haml:1\napp/views/projects/merge_requests/edit.html.haml:5\napp/controllers/application_controller.rb:125:in `render'\nee/lib/gitlab/ip_address_state.rb:10:in `with'\nee/app/controllers/ee/application_controller.rb:43:in `set_current_ip_address'\napp/controllers/application_controller.rb:479:in `set_current_admin'\nlib/gitlab/session.rb:11:in `with_session'\napp/controllers/application_controller.rb:470:in `set_session_storage'\nlib/gitlab/i18n.rb:55:in `with_locale'\nlib/gitlab/i18n.rb:61:in `with_user_locale'\napp/controllers/application_controller.rb:464:in `set_locale'\nlib/gitlab/error_tracking.rb:48:in `with_context'\napp/controllers/application_controller.rb:559:in `sentry_context'\nlib/gitlab/application_context.rb:52:in `block in use'\nlib/gitlab/application_context.rb:52:in `use'\nlib/gitlab/application_context.rb:20:in `with_context'\napp/controllers/application_controller.rb:455:in `set_current_context'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/rails_queue_duration.rb:29:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/metrics/rack_middleware.rb:17:in `block in call'\nlib/gitlab/metrics/transaction.rb:62:in `run'\nlib/gitlab/metrics/rack_middleware.rb:17:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/request_profiler/middleware.rb:17:in `call'\nee/lib/gitlab/jira/middleware.rb:19:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/go.rb:20:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/etag_caching/middleware.rb:13:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/multipart.rb:124:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/read_only/controller.rb:53:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/read_only.rb:18:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/same_site_cookies.rb:27:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/basic_health_check.rb:25:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/request_context.rb:23:in `call'\nconfig/initializers/fix_local_cache_middleware.rb:9:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/metrics/requests_rack_middleware.rb:60:in `call'\nlib/gitlab/middleware/release_env.rb:12:in `call'\n```\nScreenshot: \n\n![image](/uploads/cf18c43af36d2a23b71c727da382b47f/image.png)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n```\nroot@12103-ee:/home/vagrant# gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\t\tUbuntu 16.04\nProxy:\t\tno\nCurrent User:\tgit\nUsing RVM:\tno\nRuby Version:\t2.6.5p114\nGem Version:\t2.7.10\nBundler Version:1.17.3\nRake Version:\t12.3.3\nRedis Version:\t5.0.7\nGit Version:\t2.26.2\nSidekiq Version:5.2.7\nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:\t12.10.3-ee\nRevision:\t7c0ab260960\nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL\nDB Version:\t11.7\nURL:\t\thttp://12103-ee\nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://12103-ee/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@12103-ee:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:\tno\nGeo:\t\tno\nUsing LDAP:\tno\nUsing Omniauth:\tyes\nOmniauth Providers:\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:\t12.2.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n```\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n```\nroot@12103-ee:/home/vagrant# sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

Nevertheless, we discovered that the process has an edge case that needs to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, once the snippet is valid and the files are committed to the repository, then we move the files to the snippet. But, what happens if the uploaded files are wrong or have been tampered with? An exception will be raised. This ends up in a 500 error, leaving the uploaded files still in the user ownership instead of the snippet one (besides we should gracefully fail).\n\nMy proposal is to check, even before the snippet is created, if the files are valid. If not we add an error, and return.\n\nBut, there can be some other types of errors. The files might be valid but the `move` operation might fail. Then, in that case, we should gracefully catch that exception in the existing `rescue` block we have.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-18T06:18:05.959Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T03:03:26.332Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T03:03:26.278Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","group::editor","maintenance::refactor","priority::4","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We can pass now a `ref` param and also a file name to the request.\n\nIf no ref and file name are passed we will return the first blob raw content. This way we will keep backward compatibility.\n\nWe need to update the documentation as well to reflect this change.\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter some work was carried out to implement this change, @fjsanpedro and I decided it would be better to instead add a new REST endpoint to return the raw blob content for a given `file_path` and `ref`. This way the new route/pattern can more easily be extended in future to support things like `blame`, as well as avoid needing to deal with additional params on the existing endpoint.\n\nThis would mean we could then officially deprecate the \"old\" raw endpoint for 14.0, if we so choose.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-18T06:05:38.988Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T07:06:16.101Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T05:44:12.248Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","group::editor","quad-planning::complete-no-action","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218226","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218226","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218226/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218226/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218226","relative":"#218226","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218226"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2829,"epic":{"id":28402,"iid":2829,"title":"Snippets with Multiple Files","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2829","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34666974,"iid":218225,"project_id":278964,"title":"[StepN|BE] Add presence validation to snippet create/update mutations","description":"We are going to remove the presence validation on the `content` fields at some point.

You can set the weight from 0 to 100 to implement that kind of application release. At any time, only one of the environments is production. For this example, currently green is production and blue is canary. Initially, the weight of canary is set to 0which means no traffic is forwarded to this release. You can introduce a small portion of traffic to blue version step by step, test and verify it. If everything is OK then you can shift all requests from green to blue by set the weight of blue to 100which makes blue the production release. In a word, with such canary releasing process, the application is upgraded smoothly.\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/c4448b7809b958df84c5c7eb56c55444/image.png)\n\n`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: `The integer based (0 - 100) percent of random requests that should be routed to the service specified in the canary Ingress. A weight of 0 implies that no requests will be sent to the service in the Canary ingress by this canary rule. A weight of 100 means implies all requests will be sent to the alternative service specified in the Ingress.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-17T08:54:32.248Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T19:30:51.840Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T14:44:36.063Z","closed_by":{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"},"labels":["Category:Advanced Deployments","Deliverable","Release::P1","UX","cicd::active","devops::release","direction","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::release","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"},"user_notes_count":83,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218139","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218139","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218139/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218139/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218139","relative":"#218139","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218139"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3142,"epic":{"id":44626,"iid":3142,"title":"Update NGNIX Ingress Parameters annotations to Helm","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3142","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34641368,"iid":218098,"project_id":278964,"title":"Technical discovery - SAST analyzers have a build step that could be skipped with a env var","description":"## Description\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195252 exposes an env var to skip compilation for the [spotbugs analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/).

extended it to group-managed accounts for GitLab.com in 12.8 to help customers gain visibility into all of the PAT and SSH credentials that existed within their self-managed instance and groups. This inventory provided necessary insight into the access users had for a particular instance or group, but it does not provide other necessary capabilities such as forcing a credential rotation (in the event of a known compromise).\n\nCurrently, when an SSH is revoked, that revocation is not mentioned in the credentials inventory. There's no way for `administrators` and `group owners` to see, in aggregate, when credentials have been revoked.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a column for \"Revoked on\" to the PAT tab in the [credential inventory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36742) that shows the date a PAT was revoked (or nothing for PATs that have not been revoked):\n\n| Revoked PATs |\n| ------ |\n| ![PATs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/efeb13d9df05122863d234b3d9ef28b4/PATs.png) |\n\n### Out of scope\n\nSSH keys are out of scope because they [cannot be revoked](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218046#note_345773401).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nOnly `administrators` and `group owners` would see this specific signal since they are the only users who can view the credential inventory.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n* The `Open` and `Closed` lists can possibly inherit more epics (aka swimlanes) into the board than a user expects. \n* Independent of swimlanes- users perhaps don't even wish to use the `Open` and `Closed` swimlanes, as they are using another construct or flow and would like to use their own labels for these states.\n\n###### Hiding a list entirely\nThe open column makes sense mostly for backlog management as we don’t have this elsewhere in the product. We could potentially be forcing users in to a construct they do not follow, however a “true” kanban flow / CI flow needs this, so we shouldn’t entirely remove it.\n\n###### Open and closed list\nEngineers don’t always close issue, goes into production- which causes confusion. Needs to match filtering and perhaps have a custom closed state (ie production instead of put in workflow production AND close). All the other lists are based on label, not state. \n\n\u003e When monitoring a team's work in flight, I need to be able to easily review and digest the current progress so that I can confidently report to stakeholders and leadership.\n\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers are able to build their own workflows, and focus on swimlanes/epics that are relevant to them.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add a section right under `Board name` \n* Title this section `Board configuration options`\n* This section has 2 options for MVC:\n   * Show the Open list, Show the Closed list\n* Unchecking the `Show the Open list` option hides the open list from the board view and no longer inherits those epics and issues into the board, unchecking the `Show the Closed list` option hides the closed list from the board view and no longer inherits those epics and issues into the board\n\n| Creating a new board | Editing a current board |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|

Falco","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\nAs a security analyst, I need to monitor my containers for potentially anomalous behavior so that I can be confident that my containers have not been compromised by a malicious actor.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \nThe user will be able to follow GitLab documentation to install Falco into their Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n* The user will be able to follow GitLab documentation to install Falco in their Kubernetes cluster and connect it to GitLab\n* After installation, the user will be able to do the following:\n  * Detect when a new process is started inside a container\n  * Detect when changes are made to a file inside a container\n  * Detect when a new shell/terminal is started in the container\n  * Detect when a new port is opened\n* As we are whitelabeling the Falco functionality, the user will see that there are no direct references to falco in the UI or in the code (references can exist in documentation).  Instead of Falco, the term \"Container Host Security\" should be used to refer to the complete solution architecture (Falco + AppArmor + PSPs, etc.) and the term \"Monitoring\" should be used to refer to the Falco piece of the broader architecture.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\nInstalling Falco is a first step as part of our [Container Behavior Analytics strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/defend/container_behavior_analytics/) and a prerequisite to installing other technologies to extend the feature/functionality set that is provided by Falco.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\nThis aligns with the current GitLab permission model.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\nDocumentation will be added to inform a user how to install Falco into their environment.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n* Unit tests will be built as appropriate\n* Falco will be able to be installed together with Cilium and neither product will interfere with the other one or cause undue performance problems\n* [as much as time allows] A long-running performance test will be done to verify that there are no memory leaks or other performance problems introduced over time\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216983","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-15T20:32:58.276Z","updated_at":"2020-07-30T04:11:09.670Z","closed_at":"2020-06-23T03:54:59.549Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Container Host Security","GitLab Core","Stretch","backend","devops::govern","direction","documentation","group::security policies","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},{"id":4946308,"username":"ngaskill","name":"Nick Gaskill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4946308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ngaskill"},{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"}],"author":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218026","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218026","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218026/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218026/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218026","relative":"#218026","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218026"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3161,"epic":{"id":45248,"iid":3161,"title":"Container Host Security - Planned to Minimal","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3161","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 22, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34619920,"iid":218023,"project_id":278964,"title":"Package name validation improvements","description":"### Problem\n\nWe use a single [regex](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/481ec0956fbc3d37ade25030126c109cb47bc95b/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/regex.rb#L27) for validating the package name for all package types except for Conan.

We should find out what those are and create similar regex patterns for validating each package type separately rather than trying to combine all of the rules in one regex.\n\nMaven, NPM, NuGet, and

Cloud Native Job Logs on production for a short period and measure the performance impacts","description":"Currently our Cloud Native Job Logs ~~CI Incremental Logging~~ feature allows users to store live job logs directly in object storage, without needing an intermediate shared disk: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/job_logs.html#new-incremental-logging-architecture.\n\nUnfortunately due to performance problems, this is not yet enabled on GitLab.com. \n\nWe should work to resolve this, so we can remove NFS in GitLab.com, and also ensure this feature works at scale as it is necessary for our cloud native architecture.\n\nThe next step is to re-enable incremental logging and determine what is causing the slow downs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/4667\n\nIn order to move forward with the rollout plan all blocking issues must be resolved.

We should change this so that the target branch report uses the latest commit instead of the merged result.\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n#### Detached Merge Request, i.e. commit-on-branch, pipelines\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[\"Commit A (master)\"] --\u003e B[\"Commit B (master, A+B, BASE_PIPELINE)\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"Commit C (master, A+B+C)\"]\n  B --\u003e F[\"Commit F (feature, A+B+F, HEAD_PIPELINE)\"]\n  C --\u003e D[\"Commit D (master, A+B+C+D)\"]\n  D --\u003e E[\"Commit E (master, A+B+C+D+E)\"]\n```\n\nHere, the comparison is clear between the before and after state of the commits in the merge request. The reports are out of date against current master (not including `C`/`D`/`E`), but consistent and stable for the merge request's context.\n\n#### Merge Request Pipelines (project state is a combination of both branches)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[\"Commit A (master)\"] --\u003e B[\"Commit B (master, A+B, BASE_PIPELINE)\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"Commit C (master, A+B+C)\"]\n  B --\u003e F[\"Commit F (feature, A+B+F)\"]\n  C --\u003e D[\"Commit D (master, A+B+C+D)\"]\n  F --\u003e G[\"Commit Z (Ephemeral merge commit, A+B+C+D+F, HEAD_PIPELINE)\"]\n  D --\u003e E[\"Commit E (master, A+B+C+D+E)\"]\n  D--\u003e G\n```\n\nHere, the reports include newer information from master, which unintentionally makes things worse because our references to \"before\" and \"after\" the merge request are not in line with the actual states of the project as `base_pipeline` and `head_pipeline`.\n\n#### Options\n\nTo produce accurate reports:\n\n1. `base_pipeline` should be pointing to commit `D` OR\n1. `head_pipeline` needs to point to commit `F`\n\n**Option 1** has the benefit of including more recent information, and will be less out of date when they're first opened, as every MR pipeline creates a fresh merge commit with the current state of the target branch. However I did include commit `E` in this diagram to illustrate that in a large and/or fast-moving project (GitLab), it's likely that these widgets will become out-of-date relatively quickly. They'll also be very likely to change with every single new MR pipeline. Widgets can be refreshed by a simple click to run a new merge request pipeline. Because changing `base_pipeline` to point to a new location would have effects beyond just the code quality widget, we would likely want to introduce a new reference to `commit D` and refer to that in the code quality comparison specifically.\n\n**Option 2** has the benefit of working in the exact same way detached merge request pipelines do. The meaning of a merge request diff widget will be constant throughout every configuration of GitLab CI. To update stale widget data, the merge request will need to be rebased on the target branch, triggering a new merge request pipeline. Because the typical implementation of Merged Result Pipelines doesn't run the branch pipeline when the merged result pipeline is ran, we would have to change the code quality job to checkout `commit F` and generate the report based on that.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\nBecause the branch pipeline likely doesn't exist, option 2 is more difficult than previously thought. We should take **Option 1** above in order to fix this. It has the lowest impact and highest upside potential. We should bear in mind that we likely also want to make this change for all ~\"group::testing\" widgets, including:\n\n1. Accessibility\n1. Browser Performance\n1. Load testing\n1. Code coverage\n\nSo while making this change for CodeQuality we should look for reusability as well. It is likely that other widgets will also use this solution if we take **Option 1**\n\n#### Further Implementation Details\n\n`CodeQuality`, `BrowserPerformance`, and `LoadPerformance` are all implemented the same way in `MergeRequestWidgetEntity`, so I can confidently say that those are affected.\n\nThe security scanning widgets *seem* to suffer from this differently. They use `MergeRequest#compare_reports`:\n\n```ruby\n  def compare_reports(service_class, current_user = nil, report_type = nil )\n    with_reactive_cache(service_class.name, current_user\u0026.id, report_type) do |data|\n      unless service_class.new(project, current_user, id: id, report_type: report_type)\n        .latest?(base_pipeline, actual_head_pipeline, data)\n        raise InvalidateReactiveCache\n      end\n\n      data\n    end || { status: :parsing }\n  end\n```\n\nwhich uses `MergeRequest#actual_head_pipeline`:\n\n```ruby\n  # Use this method whenever you need to make sure the head_pipeline is synced with the\n  # branch head commit, for example checking if a merge request can be merged.\n  # For more information check: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/40004\n  def actual_head_pipeline\n    head_pipeline\u0026.matches_sha_or_source_sha?(diff_head_sha) ? head_pipeline : nil\n  end\n```\n\nwhich appears to return either `head_pipeline` (which we now know to contain changes from `target_branch`) or nil. So I think once `actual_head_pipeline` returns nil, we render the same report out of ReactiveCache forever. I'd have to investigate this more to confirm this behavior.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\nWe should explain the comparison in the documentation, likely including the diagrams above. We should find the appropriate place to explain the comparison, it may be that it belongs in the contributor documentation.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\nIf this works to improve relevancy of the widget content, this approach may be taken for other widgets. You can see a larger discussion about the relevancy of widget data here: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4006\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n[Discussion in Slack](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0SFP840G/p1596059988368500)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-15T15:56:24.191Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T14:17:18.839Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T21:05:10.310Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"labels":["Category:Code Quality","Deliverable","MR-Improvements","UX","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","merge request widget","missed-deliverable","missed:13.4","quad-planning::ready","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},{"id":3385446,"username":"zeffmorgan","name":"Zeff Morgan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3385446/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zeffmorgan"},{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"}],"author":{"id":4554255,"username":"jj-ramirez","name":"Juan J.

Mirror https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics \n2. Clone it on to your local machine\n3. Run `git lfs fetch --all` \n\nDo the same for the GitHub repo directly and no error will show up.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nYou get an error and the `lfs fetch` fails.\n\nThe mirror status received from initial sync appears to be complete and successful, when it is actually incomplete.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`lfs fetch` to work like with the GitHub Repo.\n\nWe should show the actual status of the initial sync correctly.\n\nLarge Premium customer: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/156723 (internal only)\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWhen we create a Mirror project, we trigger the [RepositoryImportWorker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/dd1e70d3676891025534dc4a1e89ca9383178fe7/app/workers/repository_import_worker.rb#L3), that calls a service that imports the [repository and after that downloads the LFS objects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/dd1e70d3676891025534dc4a1e89ca9383178fe7/app/services/projects/import_service.rb#L23).\n\nTo download the LFS objects, we make several calls to the source server requesting batches of 100 LFS object's URLs, and then we put all the URLs in a list. And after getting all the URLs, we start downloading them.\n\nAs mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217925#note_389947865, it can take a long time to get all the URLs, and because GitHub's URLs expire after 60 minutes, by the time we start downloading the files, the URLs can have expired.\n\nSo a proper solution would be to request 100 URLs, download the files, then request more 100 URLs, download the files, and repeat the process until all files are downloaded. (from @rodrigo.tomonari [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217925#note_1108829074))\n\nWe should also show the actual status of the initial sync correctly ([issue for this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375731)).\n\n### Possible workaround\n\n* [Read this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217925#note_1113727541)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-15T08:54:36.140Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T12:04:10.775Z","closed_at":"2022-12-12T15:50:34.866Z","closed_by":{"id":2277639,"username":"knockfog-ext","name":"Rostyslav Safonov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2277639/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/knockfog-ext"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Deliverable","Importer:GitHub","SoftServe::Import","customer","devops::manage","group::import","mirror","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":2277639,"username":"knockfog-ext","name":"Rostyslav Safonov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2277639/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/knockfog-ext"}],"author":{"id":2369952,"username":"rvzon","name":"Ronald van Zon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2369952/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rvzon"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2277639,"username":"knockfog-ext","name":"Rostyslav Safonov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2277639/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/knockfog-ext"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217925","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217925","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217925/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217925/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#217925","relative":"#217925","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#217925"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3050,"epic":{"id":39430,"iid":3050,"title":"🐞 GitHub Importer bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3050","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34587393,"iid":217913,"project_id":278964,"title":"Deprecate -domain-source configuration for GitLab Pages","description":"The `-domain-config-source` configuration flag for GitLab Pages was introduced with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217912 to incrementally rollout use of GitLab API-based source configuration self-managed instances of Pages.\n\n## TODO\n\n1.

When an error occurs during the execution of [gemnasiumDumpDependencies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/3c990a3387e65e0e4597e811a41e0f12e1e2bb1a/analyze.go#L171) command, no errors are surfaced and instead the message \"No dependencies found in project.\" is shown. This could lead the user to the wrong conclusions with what happened in the job.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUpdate your gradle project to point at a non-existent maven repository url:\n```\nrepositories {\n    maven { url \"https://example.com\" }\n}\n```\n\nRun `/gradle-plugin-builder/gradlew build`:\n```\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':compileJava'.\n\u003e Could not resolve all files for configuration ':compileClasspath'.\n   \u003e Could not resolve io.netty:netty:3.9.1.Final.\n     Required by:\n         project :\n      \u003e Could not resolve io.netty:netty:3.9.1.Final.\n         \u003e Could not get resource 'https://example.com/io/netty/netty/3.9.1.Final/netty-3.9.1.Final.pom'.\n            \u003e Could not GET 'https://example.com/io/netty/netty/3.9.1.Final/netty-3.9.1.Final.pom'.\n               \u003e example.com: Name or service not known\n\n```\n\nRun the plugin `` (you can do this by shelling into your project via the `gemnasium-maven` image):\n```\nroot@docker-desktop:/tmp/project# /gradle-plugin-builder/gradlew --init-script /gemnasium-gradle-plugin-init.gradle gemnasiumDumpDependencies\n\n\u003e Task :gemnasiumDumpDependencies\nNo dependencies found in project.\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s\n1 actionable task: 1 executed\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\nHere's a job where the analyzer passes successfully, but a `/gradle-plugin-builder/gradlew build` step failing with the error `No dependencies found in project.`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle/-/jobs/553604286\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe analyzer hides the errors it encounters passing jobs that ought to fail otherwise.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe analyzer should throw the errors it encounters and the jobs it is part of should fail.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. [x] Update the [walk function](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin/-/blob/98e33422f125b0d5396d2b231828779f5690aa22/src/main/kotlin/com/gemnasium/tasks/DumpDependenciesTask.kt#L139) of the [gemnasium-gradle-plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin) to throw a `GradleException` exception if the project has unresolved dependencies:\n\n   ```diff\n   val resolutionResult = configuration.incoming.resolutionResult\n   val root = resolutionResult.root\n\n   \n   + if (root.dependencies.filterIsInstance\u003cUnresolvedDependencyResult\u003e().isNotEmpty()) {\n   +   throw GradleException(\"Project has unresolved dependencies\")\n   + }\n\n   // Keep track of all direct dependencies\n   directDependencies.addAll(root.dependencies.map { it.requested.displayName })\n   ```\n\n1. [x] The [`buildGradle`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/3c990a3387e65e0e4597e811a41e0f12e1e2bb1a/analyze.go#L172-183) function shouldn't need to be updated - it should automatically output the error provided by the modified `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` from step `1.`\n1. [x] Add unit tests for the above behaviour\n   - [invalid dependency project exits with an error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin/-/blob/f3cde50a69e9cc3b0f534707b63441d7974b9742/src/functionalTest/kotlin/com/gemnasium/GemnasiumGradlePluginFunctionalTest.kt#L106-145)\n1. [x] Add manual test to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle test project\n   - [job fails as expected](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle/-/jobs/687442981) when the project has unresolved dependencies:\n     ```\n     \u003e Task :gemnasiumDumpDependencies FAILED\n     FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n     * What went wrong:\n     Execution failed for task ':gemnasiumDumpDependencies'.\n     \u003e Project has unresolved dependencies\n     BUILD FAILED in 17s\n     1 actionable task: 1 executed\n     exit status 1\n     ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1\n     ```\n   - [job passes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle/-/jobs/687447225) when the project is valid and has _no unresolved_ dependencies.\n1.
