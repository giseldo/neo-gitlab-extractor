[{"id":24697293,"iid":29243,"project_id":278964,"title":"Migrate all-remaining non-browser related Karma specs to Jest","description":"(Identified in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/895#note_175969145)\n\nKarma causes [pipeline issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/-/jobs/221517486) frequently and [seems to be getting worse](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1559135730109300?thread_ts=1559134936.109000\u0026cid=C02PF508L). Let's finish moving everything we can to Jest.\n\n## Important Links\n\n- [The `migrate-karma-to-jest` script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/playground/migrate-karma-to-jest)\n- [Jest vs. Karma counter](https://leipert-projects.gitlab.io/is-gitlab-pretty-yet/jest/)\n\n## How?\n\nWe started toying [with a bash script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/playground/migrate-karma-to-jest) to do this. This works nicely for simple find and replace patterns, but some migration steps might need a bit more logic. IMO, we should write a Node script that:\n\n1. Uses [`@babel/parser`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser) to parse the file.\n1. Passes the parsed contents through a list of functions for each rule mentioned in the \"Necessary steps\" above.\n1. Writes the result to the new file location.\n\nTo ease the burden on reviewers and reduce conflicts, let's shoot for one MR per directory.\n\n## Why use a script rather than manually migrating them?\n\n* A script is more reliable which makes it easier to review the MR.\n* There are 500+ of these specs, so writing a script could be faster.\n* If it turns out that writing a script causes too many issues, then we should revert to manually moving as many as possible.\n\n## Why \"non-browser\" related Karma specs?\n\nJest tests run with jsdom while Karma uses Chrome. As a result, we lose some native browser functionality which some tests may be dependent on. This isn't a blocker to the jestodus, but would be the next step after moving the specs that don't have this dependency.\n\n/cc @andr3 @winh","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-05T00:42:21.445Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T07:06:33.331Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T18:55:33.186Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:12.4","missed:12.5","missed:12.6","unit testing"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"}],"author":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29243","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29243","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29243/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29243/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#29243","relative":"#29243","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#29243"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":895,"epic":{"id":4891,"iid":895,"title":"Jest migration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/895","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":21583749,"iid":11957,"project_id":278964,"title":"Failing Geo specs in master","description":"* rspec geo pg ee 2/3 -

This is mostly around [security concerns](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/#important-notes-about-merge-requests-from-forked-projects) for those pipelines.  It would expose the parent projects runner, CI variables and other items to the forked project - which is likely not desired by many.\n\nHowever, there are many valid use cases where this should be allowed to happen.  For instance, take an enterprise that uses a forking instead of a branching git workflow. We should provide a way to run a pipeline in this way, with the appropriate security considerations accounted for.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* Enterprise that uses forking workflow with GitLab (GitLab.com and on-premise)\n* Open source\u2029 users (Including GitLab contributors)\n\nIn the future we will also solve this issue for non-local repos\n\n\n\n### Latest Proposal\n\n* Forked projects cannot create pipelines in the parent project by default.\n* In parent project, there is a project-level config (**Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e General pipelines**) called \"Allow MRs/PRs from forked projects to create pipelines in parent\". \n  which is off by default. If this option is enabled, [pipelines for merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/)/[pull requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/index.html#pipelines-for-external-pull-requests)\n  are created in parent project instead of forked projects.\n* With the option enabled, forked projects **can** 1. Create/Read/Update pipelines 2. Read container registry, by default.\n* With the option enabled, forked projects **cannot** access 1. [Project/group-level secret variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) 2. [Clusters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/) 3. [Project/group-level specific runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/#shared-specific-and-group-runners), 4. [Environments/Deployments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/environments.html), 5. [Service Integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/project_services.html), 6. [Release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) by default.\n* This rule is applied in both Public/Private fork workflow.\n\n\n In a future release we will handle: the parent project can allow forked projects to access these resources by enabling additional checkboxes. \nNOTE:\n\n* In PR workflow, we'd need service account in order to identify users/permissions. =\u003e More discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/5667\n* In private-fork workflow, the parent project's runners do not need to have an ability to read repository from private-fork, because merge request refs (`refs/head` or `refs/merge`) are available in the parent project already.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eProposal-v0.1\u003c/summary\u003e\n### Proposal\n\nBy taking advantage of the \"Run Pipeline for MR\" button at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/65940, we can introduce a way for members of the main (non-forked) project to run a pipeline for a fork. The way this would work is:\n\nDescription \n\n1. The button would only be available to members of the non-forked project. This could be inconvenient in some cases, but is the only way to ensure a project member is able to review the MR and ensure there are no malicious contents.\n1. Upon clicking the button, a pipeline would run in the context of the MR containing the forked pipeline ref. The pipeline runs as the user who clicked on the button, with their permissions and access. This ensures the pipeline has the access it needs.\n\nFor users of the feature, there are two main ways of working to choose from here:\n\n- Authors of the fork can be made a member of the source project, allowing them to run pipelines themselves.\n- For arbitrary/untrusted forks, the author should reach out to a project member to run the pipeline.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n \nProject membership is required, in order to use parent resources. \n\n### UX Proposal\n\n  - Add \"Allow forked projects to create pipelines\" section to CI/CD \u003e General pipelines [screenshot](/uploads/05f36156dd6359a304c21dba2b89163b/CICD_settings.png)\n  - Default checkbox to unselected\n\n![Allow_forked](/uploads/6402108c79893937de666277ccb317a8/Allow_forked.png)\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nBecause project membership is required, there is no back-door to gaining unauthorized access through this approach.\n\n### Documentation\n\nTBD\n\n### Testing\n\nTBD\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \nThis would be driven by organizational development practices, most likely set by a Director of Engineering or above.\n\n### Links / references\n* See \u0026957 for additional UX items around `only: merge requests`\n* [Circle CI's use of forked projects](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/oss/)\n* [Travis' use of forked projects](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#Pull-Requests-and-Security-Restrictions)\n\n#### Interested Customers (internal only)\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000005cxCt\n* https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/115341\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001NkpKR\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001ZzcXy\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000dG6oO\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0066100000MeW4f\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000sPtrS\n\n## TODOs:\n\n~backend \n\n- [ ] Create a new project-level config \"Allow fork pipelines to run in parent\".\n- [ ] Check pipeline triggerer's permission when the system collects variables.\n- [ ] Check pipeline triggerer's permission when the system creates deployments/evnrionemtns.\n- [ ] Allow fork MR pipelines to be created in the parent project.\n- [ ] Disallow Project/Group-level runners to pick jobs if the pipeline triggerer doesn't have access to it.\n- [ ] Remove a feature flag and update documentation (e.g. [Important notes about merge requests from forked projects](https://gitlab.com/help/ci/merge_request_pipelines/index.md#important-notes-about-merge-requests-from-forked-projects)\n\n~frontend \n\n- [ ] Create a new project-level config \"Allow fork pipelines to run in parent\"\n\n## Feature Flag\n\nThis feature is behind the feature flag `allow_fork_pipelines_to_run_in_parent` (with project scope).\n### Slack \n\n[#f_continuous_delivery](https://gitlab.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=f_continuous_delivery)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-04T16:17:58.246Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T18:49:23.324Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T10:19:50.420Z","closed_by":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"labels":["CEO Interest","CS Top 10 (2018CQ2)","Category:Continuous Delivery","GitLab Starter","Product Vision FY20","Release::P2","UI text","UX","cicd::planning","customer","customer+","devops::release","direction","frontend","group::release","internal customer","missed-deliverable","missed:12.4","missed:12.5","missed:12.6","missed:12.7","needs weight","pipeline","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Because we can't really control the service running in the build, there are several risks attached to this approach (discussion started https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/merge_requests/370#note_157586226).\n\nWe have tried to use GitLab Pages for this and use the current implementation for regular HTTP requests. but there are several workflows that wouldn't work at all. (investigation of this approach in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11078#note_175938212)\n\nThe solution seems to go through exposing the service directly and access it from outside the pod (node?). In this scenario, we can prevent these security problems and also some CORS ones.\n\nBut there is a disadvantage in this approach. We need a sidecar container running before the build service that will check the authorization for the user to access it.\n\n/cc @DouweM","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-03T14:11:31.509Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T14:59:35.634Z","closed_at":"2019-06-24T10:48:43.079Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::create","group::editor","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":693520,"iid":34,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.1","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/07/22/gitlab-12-1-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:47:58.826Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:09.107Z","due_date":"2019-07-22","start_date":"2019-06-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/34"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11913","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11913","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11913/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11913/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11913","relative":"#11913","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11913"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":167,"epic":{"id":301,"iid":167,"title":"Server side evaluation in the Web IDE","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/167","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":21529242,"iid":11912,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST log warns about non existant \"Default Context\"","description":"While running [DAST](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast), I came up with this warning in **zap.out** file.\n\n```\n10830 [ZAP-ProxyThread-7] WARN org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.API  -

This covers the following package registries: rubygems.org, Maven Central, pypi.org, and npmjs.com. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db-toolbox/-/merge_requests/11.\n- [ ] Add [packagist.org](https://packagist.org) support to gemnasium-db-toolbox. That's because this was not supported by Gemnasium Package Syncer.\n- [ ] Configure the pipeline of gemnasium-db, call `gemnasium-db-toolbox preview` for new and updated advisories.

Introduce an EventsManager factory to handle replication events creation","description":"Every event that is replicated is persisted on the database with a class that loosely follows this pattern: `Geo::#{What}#{Action}Event` like this example: `Geo::RepositoryCreatedEvent`. The initialization is handled by another class with similar name pattern: `Geo::RepositoryCreatedEventStore`. So for every “action” on every “thing” that we replicate there is at least 2 new classes just to register the events.\n\nIn order to organize the codebase and make it easier to expand what we replicate, easiser to test etc, we should try to simplify this.\n\nMy proposal is that we implement a central factory that will handle events creation and can also be used for other purposes. The API will be something like this:\n\n```ruby\nGeo::EventManager.publish_event(:repository, :created, model)\n```\n\nThis allows us to do a few things in a easier way than current strucuture:\n\n1. Intercept the events to do all sorts of things like logging, making it easier to test, etc\n2. Allow us to test with other replication mechanisms like plugging a rabbitmq/nats\n3. Publish to a PubSub (Redis/Rails Channel) for debug purpose (like showing live whats going on via a websocket livestream component, would be useful for debugging)\n4. Easier to understand what we replicate and what we are lacking\n\nWith this structure in place, we can improve our testing by having something like: \n\n```ruby\nexpect { Something.action }.to register_geo_replication_event(:repository, :created)\n```\n\nand/or implement something similar to the `Sidekiq::Testing.fake!` that will register the events in memory so you can easily/cheaply inspect them etc.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-29T14:33:28.968Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T02:48:15.068Z","closed_at":"2021-02-19T02:48:15.029Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","Enterprise Edition","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::systems","group::geo","maintenance::refactor","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This is great if all tests are run but Sasha is starting to write more complex tests that are sometimes skipped based on previous test results or other external factors to the test suite. Today those skipped tests are showing up as successful test executions in the GitLab reports, an incorrect signal to Sasha and the team about the reliability of their code.\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eThe original writeup for this feature was from @sethraymond, thanks!\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n## Description\nSome testing frameworks allow for tests to be skipped at runtime. This is convenient for various reasons, such as if resources cannot be properly allocated or if there is a filesystem issue. Currently, if a test is skipped, the CI pipeline passes with no indication of skipped tests. While a skipped test shouldn't necessarily be a total failure, it also shouldn't be a success. It would be nice for a warning to be displayed if one or more tests are skipped at runtime.\n\u003c!--\nInclude problem, use cases, benefits, and/or goals\n--\u003e\n\n## Proposal\nIf a test case result is \"skipped\", the CI pipeline should pass with warnings.\n## Links to related issues and merge requests / references\n[GoogleTest GTEST_SKIP Example](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/test/gtest_xml_output_unittest_.cc#L73)\n\n[GoogleTest GTEST_SKIP Corresponding JUnit Report](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/test/gtest_xml_output_unittest.py#L111)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who is seeing test results in pipeline results and merge requests.\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test) - Who is validating test coverage and effectiveness of those tests.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis enhances the [JUnit reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#viewing-junit-test-reports-on-gitlab) which already has a column for skipped but is not being populated today.\n\nA future enhancement could be to update the [Test Summary Widget](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#how-it-works) to include additional information about the tests skipped on the head branch compared to results on the base branch.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Update parsing of JUnit results to capture skipped tests as their own counted item.\n\t* The docs indicate cases will have a \u003cskipped\u003e entry and the test suite will have a skipped= count.\n\nThis is mentioned in the related issue.\n\n\u003e This seems to be a spec/test for this feature, it does not seem to inlcude a test for skipped tests: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acc05479b1723f8804579548d8d3bde2478c18fd/spec/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/test/junit_spec.rb\n\n\u003e This code seems to be where it creates the report - it seems to only handle pass, fail and error, not skipped. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acc05479b1723f8804579548d8d3bde2478c18fd/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/test/junit.rb#L48\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

Create a new repository\n1. Add a gitlab-ci file to run tests only against the `default` branch\n1. Enable \"merged results pipelines\" and \"pipelines must succeed before merging\"\n1. Create a merge request from `dev-1` to `dev-2`\n1.

The setting `pipeline must succeed` requires a pipeline to be created and to be `success` for a MR to be merged. Because when merging `dev-1` into `dev-2` there is no pipeline created, according to the project's CI configs, then `pipeline must succeed` requirement is not met.\n\nWhen enabling `pipeline must succeed` the author of pipeline configs must ensure that there will be a pipeline for any merge request. Only creating a pipeline when merging into `master` does not cover all cases, as in this issue.\n\nHowever, the wording of the message should be fixed and we should say exactly what's missing, like we do for open threads:\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/61a9ad1778427ea2a9345a4dba01cf09/image.png)\n\nAnother thing we could do is to ensure [our doc page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html#only-allow-merge-requests-to-be-merged-if-the-pipeline-succeeds) says that\n\n\u003e When enabling `pipeline must succeed` the author of pipeline configs must ensure that there will be a pipeline for any merge request.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-27T22:41:11.865Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T15:40:51.415Z","closed_at":"2021-01-26T13:27:27.962Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["CI/CD Core Platform","Deliverable","MR-Improvements","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","awaiting feedback","bug::transient","candidate::13.9","customer","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","merge requests","missed-SLO","pd::finished","priority::2","section::ops","severity::3","support request","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":26467,"username":"Jamesking56","name":"James King","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/da4788a54e2228df525f462e904f95b2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Jamesking56"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":81,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":27,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35562","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35562","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35562/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35562/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#35562","relative":"#35562","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#35562"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5455,"epic":{"id":212466,"iid":5455,"title":"Bugs: MR Mergeability","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5455","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24696529,"iid":29013,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make merge request harder to delete accidentally","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nMake something similar to deleting a project where you have to type some specific text in a box to confirm.\n\nWe recently had an issue suddenly deleted.

We're trying different architectural options to fix this, like ElasticSearch, but, in the meantime, there are several things we can do to improve it.\r\n\r\nGlobal search performs all these operations when we use it:\r\n- Count all projects that match the search term (with a Limit value of 1001)\r\n- Count all issues that match the search term (with a Limit value of 1001) (depending on the results we may perform 2 count operations here)\r\n- Count all merge requests that match the search term (with a Limit value of 1001)\r\n- Count all milestones that match the search term (with a Limit value of 1001)\r\n- Count all users that match the search term (with a Limit value of 1001)\r\n\r\nThen we need to perform a `SELECT` operation depending on the scope. \r\n\r\nThe time spent on each operation is:\r\n\r\n- Projects: 67ms (https://explain.depesz.com/s/wRnU)\r\n- Issues: 87ms + 6.2**s** (https://explain.depesz.com/s/zEIX and https://explain.depesz.com/s/QqCS)\r\n- Merge requests: 355ms (https://explain.depesz.com/s/xVcU)\r\n- Milestones: 13ms (https://explain.depesz.com/s/T8k)\r\n- Users: 32ms (https://explain.depesz.com/s/uLlB)\r\n\r\nThe `SELECT` operation is quicker because the `LIMIT` value is `21` but, for extrapolation, let's say we use the same `LIMIT` as in counts (1001) and a 4 chars length term. This operation takes 6.349**s** (https://explain.depesz.com/s/bL49). The other scopes are quicker than this one.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of quick fixes that will help us to improve the response time:\r\n\r\n- Lower the `LIMIT` value to 101, for example. With this value, we can cut almost in half the time spent in the issue count operation. From 6.2**s** to 3.849**s** (https://explain.depesz.com/s/fuNg).\r\n- ~~Set a min search term length. At the moment, we allow as a search term, a single char which, due to our DB size, is going to time out the request for sure. We should enforce, at least, a search term with 3 chars (I would even increase it to 4 or even 5). Here is a small comparison depending on the length of the search term:~~\r\n  - ~~4 chars: 6.349**s** (https://explain.depesz.com/s/bL49)~~\r\n  - ~~5 chars: 5.782**s** (https://explain.depesz.com/s/b4Pe)~~\r\n  - ~~6 chars: 4.371**s** (https://explain.depesz.com/s/gIbPs)~~\r\n\r\n~~In order to set the guard clause in the search term, we would need to return and show some kind of error to the user.~~\r\n\r\n### Update\r\nWe can't set a max length in the search term because we allow some resources to have a name length below that limit. For example, projects, users, they don't have a name limit. If we set the limit we won't ever be able to find those resources in searches.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nChanges in the `SearchController` may break the global search.\r\n\r\n## Involved components\r\n\r\n- `SearchController`\r\n- `SearchService`\r\n- The related views.\r\n\r\n/cc @phikai @DouweM","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-27T08:46:39.808Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T08:15:53.543Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T13:46:28.729Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","UX","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","bug::performance","devops::create","group::editor","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11777","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11777","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11777/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11777/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11777","relative":"#11777","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11777"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1609,"epic":{"id":9772,"iid":1609,"title":"Rails Controller Performance","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1609","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24696477,"iid":28987,"project_id":278964,"title":"Can't extend CI YAML templates in a reusable and non-breaking way","description":"### Proposed workaround \n\nbased on the [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28987#note_392419953)\n\nAs a workaround you can prefix the include with arbitrary number of slashes:\n\nJob1.yaml\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n  -

This JSON doc is similar to the one `pipdeptree` creates. `pipenv graph` installs the project dependencies, and this might fail if the installed packages require a specific version of Python, or specific system libraries.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDependency Scanning accurately lists and scans the package versions listed in `Pipfile.lock`, and not the highest version in range when installing from `Pipfile`.\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Implementation plan \n\n* [x] Add branch to the pipenv test project, to prove `Pipfile.lock` support; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv/-/commits/pipfile-lock-FREEZE\n* [x] Add QA job to `gemnasium-python` to test `Pipfile.lock` support; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/86\n* [x] Update user docs; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/51445\n\n### Product Management - @NicoleSchwartz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   \n* [ ] [Release Post](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/32381)\n\ncc @NicoleSchwartz @gonzoyumo @plafoucriere","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-25T08:49:49.503Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T19:23:52.021Z","closed_at":"2021-01-20T09:37:23.666Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","customer","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:12.4","missed:12.5","release post item","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":41,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":11,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11756","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":3},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11756","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11756/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11756/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11756","relative":"#11756","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11756"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1400,"epic":{"id":7868,"iid":1400,"title":"Improve Dependency Scanning support for Python","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1400","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24696473,"iid":28985,"project_id":278964,"title":"Links to notes in collapsed discussions in the same issue / MR don't work","description":"### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

It was identified that we are overwriting the subscription information every time it changes, which leaves us with no historical record of when a free user might have become a paying user and when they change the namespaces for which payments are collected. In order to be able to quantify improvements to retention and conversion, we need to have a log / track subscription information changes. Single Client View has been a problem for banking for many years and is currently costing banks a lot of money. We should ensure that we address this problem early on.\n\nCurrently, we store plan information on namespaces in the follow places and data quality seems particularly bad (a couple of examples can be found in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/251#note_179112461, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/251#note_179113734):\n\n- namespaces (gitlab.com) - under plan_id (the current plan under which the namespace is)\n- gitlab_subscriptions, where we see when the subscription was created, updated and the plan\n- orders, where we are supposed to see each transaction.\n\n### Intended users\n\nAny PM/ Data analyst looking at the data\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. @tipyn The more I look at the data, the more I am convinced that we need to have free and paid plans in 1 table with a transaction log for each change. Otherwise, there are a lot of issues with connecting the data. We should just have the user with a plan registered as free or core. We should probably have all of these have the one account number (A-S00015031 I assume has 1:1 mapping with customer_id in orders table) as we see them in the customers's portal but keep all history of changes.\n\n2. I think we can leave `namespaces` to contain only the most recent information, but we should add `product_rate_plan_id` from the orders table in customers.gitlab.com in order to know which namespaces are actually free as per (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11991). If we can get which one is free gold vs paid would be ideal, but not a requirement as we can get a proxy from Zuora. I basically excluded : `Gold Plan - 1 Year (EDU or OSS)`\u0026 `Ultimate - 1 Year (EDU or OSS)`, but I do not get all the right info this was as `Iowa State University of Science and Technology` namespace is still part of the dataset as it has just `Gold Plan` for it.\n\n3. I would imagine that `gitlab_subscriptions` comes partly from `orders` table in customers.gitlab.com. As per Eli's comments here we can add a row with every new subscription on the namespaces and have a column that indicates which one is active: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6763#note_178291594. We should also have the correct start and end date when a subscription is changed from 1 namespace to another so that it's easier to combine the information under 1 parent account and not have puzzling situations as in this example where the plan starts before the namespace is created (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/251#note_173884161).\n\n4. In `orders`\n\n* I think we should ensure that every change is registered as a transaction so that when a user changes the namespace a subscription relates to we can see that a subscription on the previous namespace has ended and a new subscription on another namespace has started. It seems like some orders are cancelled, which we can see in Zuora but cannot see in orders. We should have a way to reflect this potentially in a separate column?\n\n* We seem to have situations where a salesperson enters an order and doesn't associate a namespace, so we don't know what namespace the subscription relates to. We should potentially enforce a namespace requirement so that sales cannot enter orders without the association? It seems when a namespace is a user one and not a group, we don't register the name, so cannot easily connect to any of its data before it became paid.\n\n* We seem to miss the plan id information for certain subscriptions so we cannot quantify them as self-managed vs hosted - ex: (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/251#note_179138487 might be an example of this)\n\n* We seem to miss orders for customers where we know there is a paid namespace - ex: `appian`, https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C8D1LGC23/p1559938633040900\n\n* Yet to identify the solution for : https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/251#note_179112461 \u0026 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/251#note_179113734 (bots, which we must have the info that sth was cancelled in some way?)\n\n@amandarueda: am I missing anything here from the edge cases we discussed? Thank you!\n\n@tipyn - please note that you should probably collaborate on this issue with @eli_kastelein more closely so that all edge cases are cleared out and the free to paid analysis can be done on a recurrent basis.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-23T21:38:12.275Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T20:46:23.345Z","closed_at":"2019-09-02T10:05:22.479Z","closed_by":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James

It would be helpful if the scanner wrote a verbose log of what happened before the failure to help debug the issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAt first, the idea of just passing the `--verbose` command line argument to the upstream scanner seemed to make sense. However, this does not seem to work as after some testing it was noted that when run with `outputformat` and `outputpath` variables (these are needed by the analyzer to generate a report), the `retire.js` scanner does not output logging information.\n\nAn update to the upstream `retire.js` scanner is needed, after which verbose mode can be added to the analyzer.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] update the upstream [retire.js scanner](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js) to split logging from the report output and created a PR in the project\n- [ ] add `RETIREJS_VERBOSE` flag to the [retire.js analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/)\n- [ ] pass flag to the scanner via a command line argument\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] Add `RETIREJS_VERBOSE` as available variable in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#available-variables\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n- [ ] run analyzer against test projects ([js-npm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm), [js-yarn](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-yarn)) with `RETIREJS_VERBOSE` flag set, this should succeed AND generate verbose output from the scanner in the analyzer's job output.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nUsers are able to see verbose logging in the `retire.js` analyzer's job output by setting the `RETIREJS_VERBOSE` environment variable to `true`.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

projects","description":"**[HackerOne report #578057](https://hackerone.com/reports/578057)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-05-12, assigned to `estrike`:\n\n### Summary\n\nHello,\n\nAs per this article `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#resolvable-comments-and-discussions` , \n\n`They can then be individually resolved by anyone with at least Developer access to the project or by the author of the change being reviewed.`\n\nThis is true and they can resolve/unresolved all discussions individually. However, the user with no permissions to public projects can resolve/unresolved their own reply too!.\n\nThe problem with this is , if all the other comments/replies from the discussion thread is resolved , non members can simply change the whole discussions status to resolve/unresolved by simply posting a reply on discussions!\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \n1. Create any discussion thread in merge difference on public projects merge requests.  \n2. Now mark all the replies from this thread to resolved. This will eventually mark the discussion thread as Resolved too!\n\n![Screenshot_2019-05-12_at_18.13.46.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/783d9fcc-f68e-49da-9ec3-7d6322b5a1c1/Screenshot_2019-05-12_at_18.13.46.png)\n\n3. Now as any non member, simply post a reply on this thread. The reply will automatically posted as `Resolved` as discussion is resolved already!\n\n4. However, he can now just use this resolve/unresolved button to change the status of his own reply. Just click on green check\n\n![Screenshot_2019-05-12_at_18.16.09.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/24b9cbd8-0b67-453a-851e-8adca7d7d6a9/Screenshot_2019-05-12_at_18.16.09.png)\n\n5. On changing the status of his own reply, the whole discussion threads status changed as well! and the thread appears like below and resolved by username who is not a member of the project!\n\n![Screenshot_2019-05-12_at_18.16.54.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4db585c8-94a3-4627-ae21-ff78216849fd/Screenshot_2019-05-12_at_18.16.54.png) \n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNon- members can resolve/unresolved discussions from public projects\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnly developer or author of the change should be allowed to change the statuses as mentioned in the article\n\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and should also happen on omnibus installations too!\n\n#### Suggested Fix\n\nGuest/ reporter/non members should-not be allowed to resolve their own replies Also\n\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nNon members can resolve/unresolved discussions from public projects\n\n##

Click on any of them and look at the request in burp.\n\n```  \nGET /gitlabadminrsspl1111/thisispublicproject/activity?limit=20\u0026offset=0 HTTP/1.1  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nConnection: close  \nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*  \nX-CSRF-Token: 1  \nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.131 Safari/537.36  \nReferer: https://gitlab.com/gitlabadminrsspl1111/thisispublicproject  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nAccept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8  \nCookie: issue_board_welcome_hidden=true; promote_burndown_charts_dismissed=true; cycle_analytics_help_dismissed=1; _ga=GA1.2.922314095.1537686075; _mkto_trk=id:194-VVC-221\u0026token:_mch-gitlab.com-1537686075533-44677; pipeline_schedules_callout_dismissed=true; _biz_uid=18351712817945caaf2f1d99e4ae1589; auto_devops_settings_dismissed=true; _biz_flagsA=%7B%22Version%22%3A1%2C%22XDomain%22%3A%221%22%2C%22Mkto%22%3A%221%22%2C%22Frm%22%3A%221%22%7D; _fbp=fb.1.1549094360636.1901280804; sidebar_collapsed=false; frequently_used_emojis=thumbsup%2Cart%2Cbasketball%2Cthumbsdown%2Cbicyclist_tone3%2Cbaseball; _sp_id.6b85=1-c31c-4026-821a-1-06a8-492f-b0f0-9929021a8ee4; _gid=GA1.2.973204736.1557559750; _gitlab_session=1; _biz_sid=10f6f3; _biz_nA=1113; _biz_pendingA=%5B%5D; event_filter=team  \nIf-None-Match: W/\"1\"\n\n\n```\n\n4. If you see the `Cookie` header in above request, there is a parameter named `event_filter` . This is responsible for getting these events.\n\n5. Now to get issue or merge events, simply send this to burp repeater and change the value of `event_filter` to `issue` or `merged`.\n\n6. In response, you will get something like `{\"html\":\"\\n\",\"count\":3}` for say `merged`. This means 3 merged event took place in this project!.\n\n7. If you get count as `{\"html\":\"\\n\",\"count\":20}` , then increase the `offset` from above request by multiple of `10` till you get `count \u003c20` and then add all the counts which will give you total events for that particular action!\n\n\n### Examples POC  \nUse my project here at `https://gitlab.com/gitlabadminrsspl1111/thisispublicproject` to reproduce. you will see that 3 merged events although you cant see merge requests!\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nAble to see activity counts of actions despite only project members settings in public projects\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nThis count shouldn't be visible publicly when settings are applied\n\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too!\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nIssue/merge activity events counts visible despite only project members settings in public projects\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [Screenshot_2019-05-11_at_14.30.08.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4fb73fe0-4fb0-4ebd-8ff9-5d2f071fe349/Screenshot_2019-05-11_at_14.30.08.png)\n* [Screenshot_2019-05-11_at_14.29.54.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7a0344b1-bff9-41d6-831c-01d71e6fb992/Screenshot_2019-05-11_at_14.29.54.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-20T21:16:05.455Z","updated_at":"2020-05-27T05:45:22.866Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T21:54:07.444Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","HackerOne","Manage [DEPRECATED]","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::authentication and authorization","priority::3","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-08-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28840","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28840","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28840/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28840/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#28840","relative":"#28840","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#28840"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22555326,"iid":12651,"project_id":278964,"title":"license-management for dotnet core","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently the license-management fails while checking nuget packages from a dotnet core project.\n\n```\n/usr/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web/Sdk/Sdk.props(27,3): error : Unable to locate the .NET Core SDK.

2019-05-10, assigned to `asaba`:\n\n### Summary  \nIn Github, once the repo goes private, all the fork relationship they had before will be erased, this is for privacy reason because once the project go private, no related info should be disclosed.\n\nHowever in Gitlab, even the project goes private, the previously forked repo can still get the private project's info, i.e. the fork relationship persists. Thus disclosing info of the private project.\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \n- Create a new project say the name is `foo project` as user A  \n- User B fork `foo project`, and now user B's forked project is `bar project`  \n- User A set the permission of the project to private in `https://gitlab.com/PROJECT_PATH/edit`  \n- User B should not be able to view `https://gitlab.com/PROJECT_PATH/` anymore, which is good  \n- However User B can still somehow spy on `foo project` by visiting the link `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/ID_OF_BAR_PROJECT`, and the value of `fork_from_project` will be the info of `foo project`\n\n\n\n### Impact\n\nKeep on spying on private project if it was public before\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAllow user to keep on spying on private project if it was public before\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll fork relationship should be detached after public project goes private\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![anotherpoc2.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c61389c7-2ae3-4483-801f-5b5663894e14/anotherpoc2.PNG)\n\n## Impact\n\nKeep on spying on private project if it was public before\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [anotherpoc2.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c61389c7-2ae3-4483-801f-5b5663894e14/anotherpoc2.PNG)e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-17T22:15:37.058Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T17:10:58.903Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T14:32:12.973Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","api","backend","devops::create","forking","group::source code","priority::3","project","security","severity::3","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-07-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28802","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28802","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28802/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/28802/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#28802","relative":"#28802","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#28802"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24696080,"iid":28800,"project_id":278964,"title":"Protected tags API reveals the private groups new name even after they are removed from project membership","description":"**[HackerOne report #566078](https://hackerone.com/reports/566078)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-05-04, assigned to `estrike`:\n\n### Summary  \nHello,\n\nAt `https://gitlab.com/\u003cGroupName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e/settings/repository#js-protected-tags-settings` , you can add a group in protected tags only if it is shared with this project.\n\nWhen you add such groups here, these group remains there even after they are removed from the projects.\n\nThis is issue specially for Private projects because this vulnerability may reveal the new name of the groups( if it renamed after removing).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. As a project Maintainer, add a group in protected tags here at `https://gitlab.com/\u003cGroupName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e/settings/repository#js-protected-tags-settings` which is shared in this project Lets say `GroupA` (Public group as of now)\n\n2. Other project maintainer/owner , removes this `GroupA` from this project membership here at `https://gitlab.com/\u003cGroupName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e/project_members` and then makes it private and then renames it as `GroupB`\n\n3. The other maintainers of the project wont see this new group name as they dont have access to it and is private now.\n\n4. But , it was added in protected tags before, So they can use a below API endpoint\n\n`https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cProjectID\u003e/protected_tags`\n\n5. This will reveal the new group name through `access_level_description` parameter from response!\n\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nProtected tags API reveals the private group name even after they are removed from project membership\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnce group is removed from project membership, they shouldn't be part of protected tags. This works as expected for protected branches but not for protected tags\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nAs mentioned previously, this reveals the new private group names even after they are removed from project membership!","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-17T18:44:44.809Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T22:40:16.482Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T03:00:38.756Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick

And exposure of those services would bring a high security impact to gitlab infrastructure.\n\n### Examples\n\nCheck the user username4 on gitlab.com, you will see his email address is ngalog@gitlab.com and verified.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nEmail is verified without going through the verification process\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nEmail should not be verified using this method\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-05-04_at_5.47.01_PM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/15c06325-19e0-4b52-9167-85f524d84c1a/Screen_Shot_2019-05-04_at_5.47.01_PM.png)\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com)\n\n## Impact\n\nsee above\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [Screen_Shot_2019-05-04_at_5.47.01_PM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/15c06325-19e0-4b52-9167-85f524d84c1a/Screen_Shot_2019-05-04_at_5.47.01_PM.png)\n\nIssue on DEV: https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/issues/2870","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-17T12:38:08.732Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T20:22:26.036Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T10:09:52.116Z","closed_by":{"id":4056133,"username":"jeremymatos","name":"Jeremy Matos","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c972d878793ca2302186e5d8c0c0dd8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremymatos"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","HackerOne","Manage [DEPRECATED]","backend","group::authentication and authorization","priority::2","security","severity::2"],"milestone":{"id":693520,"iid":34,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.1","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/07/22/gitlab-12-1-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:47:58.826Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:09.107Z","due_date":"2019-07-22","start_date":"2019-06-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/34"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-06-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11643","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11643","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11643/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/11643/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11643","relative":"#11643","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#11643"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1321,"epic":{"id":7381,"iid":1321,"title":"Manage Global Optimization: S2","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1321","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":20989792,"iid":11640,"project_id":278964,"title":"SCIM token is still Viewable After Creation","description":"**[HackerOne report #565884](https://hackerone.com/reports/565884)** by `ngalog` on 2019-05-04, assigned to `hackerjuan`:\n\n### Summary  \nSCIM token of the group should be hidden once it's reset/create.

However, there is not currently a way to purge the cache, which could result in additional storage costs down the road. \n\n### Intended users\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n- The Package group has been discussing utilizing GraphQL to power the front-end. This may be a simple use case, and give us the ability to add a frontend for the API relatively quickly. \n\n#### Investigation details\n\n#### Purge all cached blobs for the given group\n\n`DELETE /groups/:id/dependency_proxy/cache`\n\nTo delete all cached blobs for a group, we simply need to run some variation of `group.dependency_proxy_blobs.delete_all`. Blobs are handled within disk or object storage by `DependencyProxy::FileUploader`.\n\n1. Add endpoint to delete cached blobs for a group\n\n#### Use cases\n1. From the command line, group administrators may utilize the GitLab API to manually purge the blobs from their group's Dependency Proxy. \n1. From the user interface, an admin may click a button and purge the cache for the group's dependency proxy. \n\n### Proposal\nAs an MVC, create a new GitLab API for the Dependency Proxy, which will allow Admin the ability to purge the cache of a group's Dependency Proxy. and define an interval in which to routinely purge the cache. \n\n#### Examples\n- `DELETE /groups/:id/dependency_proxy/cache`\n  - Purge all cached blobs for the given group\n- `POST /groups/:id/dependency_proxy/expiration_cadence`\n  - Define the cadence for which to regularly purge the group's Dependency Proxy.\n  - Set the default for all groups to 60 days. \n\n#### Beyond the MVC\n- [Define the cadence for which to regularly purge the group's Dependency Proxy.]()\n- Add a user interface to allow admin to update via the UI\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- The API should be limited to Admin\n\n### Documentation\n- Create documentation for the Dependency Proxy API\n\n### Testing\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nSuccess looks like we give Admin an easy way to manage storage costs.\n\n#### Metrics\n- Count the number of API events run for self-managed and GitLab.com\n- Track the defined cadence as part of the API event, so we can continue to refine our default settings.\n\n### Links / references\n- [Dependency proxy

This is amplified by our UI that relies on icons and tooltips for resolvable comments. It does not help that the two actions are often extremely close to each other and the associated tooltip for a resolvable comment so far said `Mark as resolved` without mentioning whether it meant the discussion or just the comment.\n\n![image](/uploads/572634f4382b5687c1774318b90bce97/image.png)\n\nIt also creates problems in situations like the following:\n- Person A resolves a comment\n- Person B resolves the discussion\n- Person A unresolves the discussion\n\nIn the scenario above, all comments are unresolved again, even though Person A had already resolved the individual comment.\n\nThere also is a lot of functionality around the discussions, e.g. unresolved discussions blocking merge requests or the possibility to jump to unresolved discussions. None of this exists for comments. \n\n### Proposal\n\nLooking at how often this feature is being used, we should consider getting rid of resolvable comments altogether, so we can avoid this confusion. For every use case I heard so far, there are workarounds such as adding a checkmark icon, which do not have the same problems as our current UI solution and do not make our interface even more complex.\n\nNote: the top comment resolve checkmark now needs to resolve the whole thread and not just the individual root note.
