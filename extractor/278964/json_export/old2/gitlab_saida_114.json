[{"id":70058233,"iid":238989,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support managed group owners revoking PATs in the RevokeService","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe `RevokeService` is a centralised tool to handle the revoking of PATs. However, this currently only supports either revoking your own tokens or others if you are an instance admin.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nN/A - This will lead to user experience goals but this issue is specifically about providing the tooling to do so.\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the `RevokeService` to allow managed group owners the ability to revoke PATs created by users within their managed group. This will probably entail adding the `:revoke_token` ability to managed group owners in a limited capacity.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis is currently blocking the implementation of a [revoke button within the credentials inventory on managed groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214811).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis will add a new permission to the managed group owners. Care should be taken to make sure that these owners are only able to control PATs within their managed group and we don't inadvertently leak to other managed groups or all instance users.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-20T09:45:38.699Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T22:53:29.886Z","closed_at":"2020-10-14T14:55:13.409Z","closed_by":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Deliverable","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::2","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"}],"author":{"id":5209897,"username":"rob.hunt","name":"Robert Hunt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5209897/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rob.hunt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238989","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/238989","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/238989/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/238989/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#238989","relative":"#238989","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#238989"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70057937,"iid":238988,"project_id":278964,"title":"Denial of Service Attack on gitlab-shell","description":"**[HackerOne report #953444](https://hackerone.com/reports/953444)** by `yvvdwf` on 2020-08-07, assigned to @ngeorge1:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\nHi,\n\nI found that gitlab-shell allows to generate 2F keys by executing `2fa_recovery_codes` command.   \nBefore generating the key, it reads directly confirmation from user [twofactorrecover.go#L36](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/-/blob/2fdcd175ce7a8aa0a93aa41f47f55d39824adc13/internal/command/twofactorrecover/twofactorrecover.go#L36)\n\n```go  \n       ....  \n\tvar answer string  \n\tfmt.Fscanln(c.ReadWriter.In, \u0026amp;answer)\n\n\treturn answer == \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;  \n       ....  \n```\n\nThe user\u0026#39;s response will be loaded into `answer` variable.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\nAs a GitLab Engineer I want to know how many unique unit tests are parsed on a weekly basis on a GitLab instance as part of the usage ping payload so that I can effectively plan how I need to structure data related to the unit test features. Establishing an average number of unique unit tests per instance will be enormously helpful in planning the technical implementation of future testing features, including test history.\n\nAs a GitLab Product Manager I want to know how many unique unit tests are parsed on a weekly basis on a GitLab instance as part of the usage ping payload so that I can measure usage of the JUnit testing report feature and monitor it over time.\n\n### Intended users\n@rickywiens \n@jheimbuck_gl \n\n\n### User experience goal\nNo visible change to UX\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n\n### Proposal\nWhen we parse a JUnit report in the background we should use the [HLL counter](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/telemetry/usage_ping.html#redis-hll-counters) in Usage ping to count the key created for the test. HLL counters will increment only if the key passed is unique. We should think about how to make the key more meaningful. One idea is that we could concatenate the job name to the [existing key](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/test_case.rb#L26). We should hash whatever key we decide on before passing it to the HLL counter. We should pass them to the HLL counter in batches of 1000.\n\n#### Concerns\nWe likely want to pass as many unit tests as possible in batches to the HLL function. I'm not sure how the HLL wrapper class works, but we likely only want to pass a few hundred/thousand at a time into Redis directly. Keep in mind when we are parsing the JUnit report there can be _hundreds of thousands_ of keys that we will want to insert into the HLL.\n\nWe [benchmarked the different batch sizes](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CSW59LY67/p1598385623001500) (internal) and decided to go with batches of 1k, with hashed values.\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWhen replacing `Ci::LegacyStage` with `Ci::Stage` there are a few places to consider:\n\n- removing `Ci::Pipeline#legacy_stages`\n  - replacing `legacy_stages` in templates\n- `latest_statuses_ordered_by_stage` (consider `import_export/all_models.yml`)\n- removing `Ci::Pipeline#legacy_stage`\n  - replacing `legacy_stages` in `Projects::PipelinesController`\n\nAdditional notes from comment:\n* When we remove `Ci::LegacyStage` we should evaluate whether it's possible to remove `StageUpdateWorker` and `Ci::EnsureStageService`. This would be an additional step towards deprecating [stage related columns of ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213103#note_319167524)`ci_builds` table.  \n:white_check_mark: ~~* Before we remove `Ci::LegacyStage` we should make `Ci::Stage` presentable so we can replace `pipeline.legacy_stages` in the view with `pipeline.stages`. Perhaps we need to make this behind a feature flag an in separate MR prior to actually removing `Ci::LegacyStage`~~ \u003c- `Ci::Stage` is already presentable: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/presenters/ci/stage_presenter.rb\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n- related issue: #28406\n- related issue: #213103\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

file](https://www.figma.com/file/7CaJqOTOpPEOzkYkoU5bs5/DAST-Ondemand-Profile?node-id=1024%3A0)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] The `Validation` section should be hidden as long as the `Target URL` is invalid\n- [x] Add `GlToggle` and section that is expanded / collapsed based on the toggle's state\n- [x] Default to the toggle set to `false` but if the site has been verified it should be set to `true`\n- [x] Within the section:\n  - [x] Show an alert if the current profile has not been validated\n    - [ ] Enabling the toggle, or changing the `Target URL` while the toggle is enabled should trigger a GraphQL query to verify whether the site has already been validated (TODO: agree on schema)\n  - [x] Step 1:\n    - [x] Add `GlFormGroup` which contains a button that lets the user download the text file specific to the project (?profile)\n  - [x] Step 2:\n    - [x] Add `GlFormGroup` which contains a text input (prepending the `targetURL`)\n- [x]

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nOur Commercial customers have expressed interest in a way to add users to their groups without validating their emails. The theory is, if they come through their SSO solution, they should not need to be verified again in GitLab. Since this could result in a security issue, the verifying of emails coming through SSO should be limited to domains the customer proves ownership over. Related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23611. If an email added through SSO does not belong to the customer's group verified domain(s), then it should require extra validation. We should not automatically validate emails for any other domains coming through SSO.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAllow customers to add verified domains to their GitLab.com hosted group as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23611. The framework for such a feature already exists within [Pages Custom domains and SSL/TLS Certificates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/). We can then use that verified domain to auto-verify account emails that belong to that verified domain. We could expand this a little more and prevent users from adding additional emails to these types of accounts. Tying into and further locking down [Group Managed Accounts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/group_managed_accounts.html).\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nWhen users are added through SSO that do not have resolvable emails, they are unable to validate them. Since SaaS users do to have access to admin tools, users need to open a support ticket to resolve. We have customers that run into this issue on a regular basis, requiring many tickets to validate those accounts. We should make it easier for companies and their employees to adopt and grow their userbase, with as little friction to getting started as possible, while also keeping their groups secure.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\nOnly group Owners should be able to verify a corporate domain and enable the verification bypass on that verified domain. Both in the UI and via the API.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n- [Group Managed Accounts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/group_managed_accounts.html) - amended to add the auto-verify option. Describing that feature is available after a domain is verified.\n- [GitLab authentication and authorization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/) - all providers updated to note how to enable the bypass of validation for verified emails.\n- [Group Advanced Settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#advanced-settings) - describes how to verify the domain in their group.\n\nSelf-managed customers can already bypass the validation by disabling [User email confirmation at sign-up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/user_email_confirmation.html). They also have admin rights, so can do all of the things described in [Updating to GitLab 13.2: Email confirmation issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/upgrade_email_bypass.html#what-do-i-need-to-know-as-an-administrator-of-a-gitlab-self-managed-instance)\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nSuccess is customer SSO accounts being created with their corporate domains without any friction. Measured by the reduction in support tickets and requests to verify corporate domain accounts.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n* [Skyler (Chief Information Security  Officer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#skyler---the-chief-information-security-officer)\n\nFor the SSO validation bypass, the tier could be Ultimate/Gold based on the type of buyer. It would fit better in Premium/Silver with the rest of the Group SSO features. This feature was initially requested by a current Ultimate customer - https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000KvahJ (Internal) and entered on their behalf.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

As we discovered in [the profile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238194#note_478137563), the bottle neck is the Markdown rendering for the release descriptions. \n\n## How the current caching works\n\nBasically, there are two process steps on markdown rendering:\n\n* Pre-processing. When a user inputs `description` filed of `release`, the plain texts will be converted to HTML that will be rendered as Markdown. This converted data will be persisted into database as `description_html`.\n* Post-processing. Re-process the `description_html` when it's provided **for users**. Specifically,\n  * [Redacting confidential issues](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/-/merge_requests/2869)\n  * [Render special references for release entities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26554)\n\nThe key point is that pre-processing doesn't take **user information** into account. The final content of the markdown will *vary per user*. For example, non-project members see the confidential issue as just a plaintext URL, but project members see the issue title on tooltip.\n\nSo if we want to address the core performance problem, here are some approaches to consider:\n\n* Improve the post-processing facility `MarkupHelper.markdown_field`. There *might* be room for the further optimization (I've not checked the entire implementation).\n* We cache post-processed content into Redis when user accesses the GraphQL query, so the second or latter rendering will be significantly faster. But, since cached data could exist for the number of users, this could pressurize the redis capacity. Also, we have to think we these data should be invalided.\n* We don't post-process `description_html`, but present it directly. We change pre-processing to persist redacted data beforehand. Users can no longer see [any special references](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26554). i.e. sacrificing UX for performance.\n\n\n# Proposal\n\nGiven the approaches described above takes some efforts/times to get this issue fixed, at first we take the most boring, but effective approach that reducing page size to 10 from 20.\n\nAs the smaller number of entries that need to post-process the `description_html`, we can expect an immediate performance improvement. For example, in my local environment, The loading time is cut down to half.:\n\n[`PAGE_SIZE = 20`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/releases/constants.js#L16) =\u003e 1490 msec\n\n![screenshot_222](/uploads/179fc03a500d6e11cb11e9f943289ca5/screenshot_222.png)\n\n[`PAGE_SIZE = 10`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/releases/constants.js#L16) =\u003e 691 msec\n \n![screenshot_221](/uploads/baed2438572ffd68b5eeeba311961149/screenshot_221.png)\n\nThis per-page-size seems same with Git**Hub** releases that shows 10 releases by default ([Example](https://github.com/rails/rails/releases)).\n\n# Reference\n\n- [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19VENf6d54vuQn7RWjGbA4j2yCgjnNnHHzZ0FZqgonPU/edit#gid=0) (Internal Only)\n---\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eprevious description\u003c/summary\u003e\nhttps://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/releases?per_page=20 takes 1-1.5 seconds to load, which is very slow for only 20 items being rendered.\n\n* [ ] We [expose assets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a901c04ba1d4bd86613efddc583fcf7e02da9005/lib/api/entities/release.rb#L23), but [don't preload them](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a901c04ba1d4bd86613efddc583fcf7e02da9005/app/models/release.rb#L29).

for link_type package","description":"### Summary\n\nCreating a release with an asset file path via the API does not generate a direct asset link for `link_type=package`.\n\nThe [Releases API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#create-a-release) create release documentation states that setting a `assets:links:filepath` should generate a [Direct Asset Link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html#permanent-links-to-release-assets) that should have the format `https://host/namespace/project/releases/:release/downloads/:filepath`.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a release including `filepath` and `link_type=package` via the Releases API\n1. Visit a release page and check the URL for the assets or\n1. Get the link from the API \n\n```shell\ncurl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: $GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/18239424/releases/v1.8.0-rc/assets/links\"\n\n[{\"id\":66329,\"name\":\"image1\",\"url\":\"https://image.freepik.com/free-vector/shining-circle-purple-lighting-isolated-dark-background_1441-2396.jpg\",\"direct_asset_url\":\"https://image.freepik.com/free-vector/shining-circle-purple-lighting-isolated-dark-background_1441-2396.jpg\",\"external\":true,\"link_type\":\"package\"}]%\n```\n\n1. The value of `url` and `direct_asset_url` are the same.\n\nThis does *NOT* happens for `image` and `other` `link_type`\n\n### Example Project\n\n- Issue for `link_type=package` [`v1.8.0-rc1`](https://gitlab.com/jaime/hello/-/releases/v1.8.0-rc1)\n\n- Not an issue for `link_type=other`  [`v1.8.0-rc2`](https://gitlab.com/jaime/hello/-/releases/v1.8.0-rc2)\n- Not an issue for `link_type=image` [`v1.8.0-rc3`](https://gitlab.com/jaime/hello/-/releases/v1.8.0-rc3)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nA direct asset url is not generated for `link_type=package`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe direct asset URL should be of the form `https://host/namespace/project/releases/:release/downloads/:filepath` as described in [Direct Asset

As many issues may be in the process of loading, this could possibly take some time, and we want to reduce any uncertainty for users. We also want to reduce risk of overwhelming users with multiple loading states and issues popping in and changing the height of their board, etc. Preventing users from interacting  with the data until it is a stable state can also help prevent some error.\n\nThis could also apply to classic boards or boards without swimlanes as well.\n\n\n| Current state |\n| ------ |\n| \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/eac1527ccffba9168cdd2f527ec76155/image.png\" width=\"500\"\u003e | \n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers understand that their entire board is still loading (even at slow internet speeds), or that they have correctly applied a change and their board is in a state of loading to reflect those changes. Users have a general expectation of what type of content will be loaded- reducing uncertainty.\n\n### Proposal\n\n**For MVC:**\n\n- Introduce a skeleton loader that displays until the initial batch of issues on a board has been fetched. This would apply to boards with and without swimlanes.\n   - In other words- the skeleton displays until the first batch of issues has been loaded into all columns, or all initial swimlanes. \n   - Spinners would still display in instances when a user is \"loading more\".\n- Skeleton should be fairly low fidelity and just serve to reduce uncertainty about the board loading, not to represent the exact data on the board.\n- This could look something like:\n![swimlanesloading](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/66e260b8c6d02616628a6446f01a1ad5/swimlanesloading.mov)\n- Add this loader to gitlab-ui and Figma via issues in those projects\n\n**Future scope:**\n- Ideate perhaps on skeleton loads for swimlanes and *maybe* columns to enable better progressive loading\n\n------\n\n| Less

configurable maximum mirroring frequency on self-hosted","description":"\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nGitLab [CI for external repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/) is currently reliant on the [repository mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html#overview) capability. In 13.0, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118753 added an application limit on pull mirroring that enforced a 5 minute delay between mirroring/updates. This hard-coded maximum mirror frequency negatively impacted CI pipelines for external repos, making this CI feature effectively un-usable for teams pushing more often than once every 5 minutes. This problem applies to both self-hosted and GitLab.com users.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nAllow the maximum mirror frequency to be a configurable application limit so that:\n- On self-hosted instances, admins can adjust or even disable the 5 minute delay\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Make the maximum mirror frequency a configurable application limit.\n2. Make the limit of \"create the pipeline for the first 4 refs in a single push\" a configurable application limit that can be customized on self-hosted.\n\n\nNOTE: Long term solution to make CI for external repositories more performant will be addressed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235916.\n\n### Further details\n\nWhile the limitation implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118753 was intended to address performance issue with excessive mirroring and to prevent problems at GitLab.com at scale, this had unintended and significant negative impact on the `CI for External Repository` feature.\n\nExample:\nIf Developer A pushed a change in minute 1, all pushes from any developer are ignored from a CI perspective until minute 6. Then if at minute 6 Dev B pushes, all subsequent changes are ignored. And given that all queued mirroring attempts are purged, any push in between minutes 1 and 6 will need to be manually run by specifying the commit in the New Pipeline page - and only after the push at minute 6 occurs. \n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes - Yes, please have test for all new/updated implementations \n* End-to-end test change - Yes, with this new E2E test scenario https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/144 (WIP MR that can be completed once this feature is implemented !42289)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly.

The analyzer ends up appending the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` contents to the `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-cert-additional-gitlab-bundle.pem` without any newlines, which causes an invalid certificate:\n\n   ```\n   /code # cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-cert-additional-gitlab-bundle.pem\n\n   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n   MIIEQzCCAyugAwIBAgIUe5OYnWvcwt2MgCpVSUgvFa8E3D0wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL\n   IPcVVawMK/ChUcbktFylIAu9ohWrJHU5KuDrzhEOyG+0hEFGFnzYfpJSADIHvNNS\n   Gtpf/YEZclLD7wHrkhbeIThnU/Z9q270dm15wEGO9MLACEob6DZo\n   -----END CERTIFICATE----------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n   MIIEQzCCAyugAwIBAgIUe5OYnWvcwt2MgCpVSUgvFa8E3D0wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL\n   IPcVVawMK/ChUcbktFylIAu9ohWrJHU5KuDrzhEOyG+0hEFGFnzYfpJSADIHvNNS\n   Gtpf/YEZclLD7wHrkhbeIThnU/Z9q270dm15wEGO9MLACEob6DZo\n   -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n   ```\n\n   The above certificate file is invalid and will cause other tools that try to use it, such as `git`, to fail.

Figure out the correct way to read the certificate file into the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` environment variable when running Docker from the commandline, because using `-e ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE=\"$(cat test.crt)\"` doesn't work correctly, even when I tried adding newlines into the `test.crt` file\n1. Switch to using `fmt.Fprintln(f, b.content)` so that newlines are automatically inserted - I've tested this and it doesn't seem to alter the current behaviour when passing the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` value as a CI environment variable\n1. Update the logic for writing the CA certificate file so it checks to see if the certificate has already been written to the `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-cert-additional-gitlab-bundle.pem` file, and if so, it doesn't append another copy of it\n1. Do nothing, but this means that developers testing this locally will only be able to execute the `/analyzer run` command once before it results in an invalid certificate file\n\n### Further details\n\n@dsearles also experienced the problem described in this issue and had the following to say:\n\n\u003e I remember running into a similar error when I was working through changing the behavior to append rather than override. I'm not sure how to solve `1.`, but that would be a nice approach. When I noticed the same behavior, then I switched to `2.`, but noticed that it added an extra newline between the certs and stuck with this approach as it's more common for a single run to happen in an analyzer than multiple runs. From my perspective, `3.` would be ideal, but likely quite difficult to achieve. In the end, I'm open to any of the options above as I'd like to eventually move away from using common for certs in the ~\"group::static analysis\" analyzers (for more info, see: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218840).\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nSince the git config write in the same package already uses `fmt.Fprintln` to achieve the desired result, it will be consistent to continue to use this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/master/cacert/bundle.go#L82\n\n- [x] update https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/master/cacert/bundle.go#L54 with `fmt.Fprintln`\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/merge_requests/140\n- [x] test by building an analyzer with the new version of common and ensuring that running `/analyzer run` multiple times does not corrupt the ca cert in `DefaultBundlePath = \"`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-cert-additional-gitlab-bundle.pem`\n   -

experiment grouping on subsequent record_experiment_user calls","description":"## The Problem\n\nThe way we currently have [the new `experiments` and `experiment_users` tables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38397/diffs#41af4a6fa5a10c7068559ce21c5188483751d934) set up is likely to cause issues when experiments roll out to more \u0026 more users over time.\n\nHere’s the relevant code from the updated `lib/gitlab/experimentation.rb` file:\n\n```ruby\nmodule Gitlab\n  module Experimentation\n    def record_experiment_user(experiment_key)\n      return unless Experimentation.enabled?(experiment_key) \u0026\u0026 current_user\n\n      ::Experiment.add_user(experiment_key, tracking_group(experiment_key), current_user)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nAnd here are the related bits from the new `app/models/experiment.rb` file:\n\n```ruby\nclass Experiment \u003c ApplicationRecord\n  has_many :experiment_users\n\n  def self.add_user(name, group_type, user)\n    experiment = find_or_create_by(name: name)\n\n    return unless experiment\n    return if experiment.experiment_users.where(user: user).exists?\n\n    group_type == ::Gitlab::Experimentation::GROUP_CONTROL ? experiment.add_control_user(user) : experiment.add_experimental_user(user)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe problem really comes into play on this line from `Experiment.add_user`:\n\n```ruby\nreturn if experiment.experiment_users.where(user: user).exists?\n```\n\nWhat that line is doing is exiting the method early if we’ve already recorded the given user’s `id` for the given experiment name. It does not take into account what the `group_type` was or what it is now.\n\nWhat will happen is that when we first roll out an experiment we might open it up to 10% of users, and then as we gain insights or gain confidence in the experiment code, we might ramp that up to 25% of users. When we change from 10% to 25% we’ll begin including users in the “experiment” group who were previously in the “control” group. That means we’ve already recorded them in the `experiment_users` database and we’ve already recorded them as being in the “control” group. Even though they are now in the “experiment” group, we’ll see that we’ve already recorded this user `id` for this experiment `name` and we’ll skip recording them again (even though they’re now in the “experiment” `group_type`).\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nRather than bailing out on the method altogether, we should run an `update` on the found `experiment_users` row to change the recorded `group_type` from “control” to “experiment”. We should also add a `group_type_updated_at` timestamp column to keep track of when the user’s `group_type` was changed from “control” to “experiment”.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T20:43:43.891Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T19:42:47.575Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T19:42:47.447Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"labels":["devops::growth","group::acquisition","milestone::p3","section::growth","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"}],"author":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/236185","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/236185","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/236185/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/236185/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#236185","relative":"#236185","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#236185"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4481,"epic":{"id":115881,"iid":4481,"title":"Record Experiment Data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4481","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69817076,"iid":236181,"project_id":278964,"title":"Set default for current_value in SAST config UI","description":"In the current implementation of SAST config UI, we are reading the default_value from SAST template and current_value from `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.

Beware of the \"select text\" pattern.\n\n## Involved components\n\n* `app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/inline_diff_view.vue` and descendants\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n## Availability and Testing\n\nThere are QA tests involving some of the markup to be changed (for example, there's [a QA selector in at least one file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d8af8dd1e0c87233c280aebe45fa6c0432631bab/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components/inline_diff_table_row.vue#L154)), so some QA page objects may need to be updated and `package-and-qa` should be run.\n\n- [ ] Please run `package-and-qa` and consult ~Quality if any tests fail.\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease select the appropriate label from the following:\n    ~\"feature::addition\"\n    ~\"feature::maintenance\"\n    ~\"tooling::pipelines\"\n    ~\"tooling::workflow\"\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T18:44:49.251Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:09:09.912Z","closed_at":"2020-11-23T17:53:41.497Z","closed_by":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","devops::create","diff","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.5","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/236075","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/236075","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/236075/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/236075/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#236075","relative":"#236075","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#236075"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4208,"epic":{"id":94875,"iid":4208,"title":"Decrease DOM node and component count of MR Diffs app","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4208","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
