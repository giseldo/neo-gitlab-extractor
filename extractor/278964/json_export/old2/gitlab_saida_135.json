This will take less time and be more performant.\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst) can use GraphQL aware tools more effectively if this functionality is available.\n--\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nBring GraphQL up to feature parity with REST api with respect to Merge Requests.\n\n### Documentation\n\nGraphQL documentation is automated and enforced by static checks.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nNew GraphQL features need unit tests (at the type, field, resolver, finder and request level).\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nTools that use the REST api for merge requests can always be re-written to use the GraphQL api.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-12T14:01:30.535Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T16:52:26.754Z","closed_at":"2021-06-14T16:52:26.744Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","GraphQL","devops::create","group::source code","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217475","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217475","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217475/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217475/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#217475","relative":"#217475","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#217475"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34454963,"iid":217472,"project_id":278964,"title":"Dismissed vulnerabilities displayed by default in the Security Dashboard with standalone vulnerabilities","description":"### Summary\n\nIn the new Security Dashboard using [Standalone Vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/634), dismissed vulnerabilities are now displayed by default, while in the previous version of the dashboard, they were hidden by default.\nIt creates a lot of noise, and users will be confused about this new behavior. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Go to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/security/dashboard\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/security/dashboard\nhttps://staging.gitlab.com/secure-team-test/dependency-list-test/-/security/dashboard\n\n### What is the current behavior?\n\nAll vulnerabilities appear in the list, whatever their status. The Status filter defaults to `All`, meaning even the resolved ones!\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nI want to see what's next, not the whole history of vulnerabilities all the time.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI'd suggest to default to `Detected` + `Confirmed` by default.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] The `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/first_class_vulnerability_filters.vue` contains a watcher for `$route.query`. This initialise the filters based on the URL. If there is no filters defined in the URL, we can simply default to `confirmed` + `detected`. The only thing that needs to be figured out is whether we reflect this in the URL or not. Otherwise we'll have a mismatch between the URL state and filters state. Alternatively, we can replace the history if there are no filters and redirect the user to `confirmed` + `detected`. I (@svedova) personally like this approach more as it keeps the URL and the filters state in sync.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-12T13:41:07.780Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T08:09:12.412Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T05:34:36.191Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","UX","UX debt","devops::secure","frontend","group::threat insights","type::maintenance","workflow::staging"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"}],"author":{"id":30915,"username":"plafoucriere","name":"Philippe Lafoucrière","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/30915/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/plafoucriere"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217472","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217472","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217472/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217472/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#217472","relative":"#217472","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#217472"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3400,"epic":{"id":59167,"iid":3400,"title":"Enhance Finding → Vulnerability → Issue/MR workflow","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3400","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34450486,"iid":217466,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Check if primary can be contacted from secondary","description":"# Problem to solve\n\nThe primary node must be offline or in maintenance before promoting a secondary to prevent a split brain situation.

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nOnly project members in the parent project can create pipelines in the parent, thus they can create pipelines from the fork-MR\" (See more https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11934#note_184868345 or https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/23902#note_123120541). The good thing of this approach is that the code has already been reviewed by maintainer/reviewers so that parent project members would notice malicious code (e.g. trying to steal secret variables, etc) before they create a pipeline for fork-MR. The downside is that it's manual process. External contributors have to ask project members to run pipelines in the parent project.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAllow parent project's members with Role Developer and up to create [pipelines for merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/) for fork MRs.\n\n**Note** Since a member of the paren't project is running the pipeline he/she has access to all the project's resources. This does add a manual step for the member to perform a code review but also, adds the opportunity to review and make sure no malicious code is merged (for example stealing secrets)\n\nFor this first iteration - we will show a security warning \n\n__note:__ The following mocks are final except the copy which is being discussed at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217451#note_375870832\n\n| Mockup of merge request pipeline section if the user has enough permissions ([Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/3V6RCjp7cAOmEI3MBYOD3K/Create-project-pipelines-for-fork-merge-requests-gitlab-org-gitlab-217451?node-id=2%3A29))  |\n| --- |\n| ![Widget_pipeline_section_-_member](/uploads/5f3217e14749fb13dda224898923fc7e/Widget_pipeline_section_-_member.png) |\n\n| Mockup of merge request pipeline section if the user does not have enough permissions ([Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/3V6RCjp7cAOmEI3MBYOD3K/Create-project-pipelines-for-fork-merge-requests-gitlab-org-gitlab-217451?node-id=2%3A29))  |\n| --- |\n| ![Widget_pipeline_section_-_anyone](/uploads/6e9dd7eacfbef51c85df9229c301b96e/Widget_pipeline_section_-_anyone.png) |\n\n| Mockup of modal shown when triggering a pipeline that runs forked project code on the parent ref ([Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/3V6RCjp7cAOmEI3MBYOD3K/Create-project-pipelines-for-fork-merge-requests-gitlab-org-gitlab-217451?node-id=2%3A29))  |\n| --- |\n| ![Modal_run_pipeline](/uploads/398d65bcf8d68ffdcede60ab54ad6df5/Modal_run_pipeline.png) |\n\n__Note:__ The following warning needs to be rewritten.

With this issue, the problem can effectively be resolved. This brings significant values to us that basically allows us to dogfooding merge train on `gitlab-org/gitlab` project. You can see more context in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/issues/195.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nAny project member with developer Role and up should be able to run the parent pipeline\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n[Example fork merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/27490)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-12T10:17:20.382Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T10:25:38.456Z","closed_at":"2020-07-29T08:41:59.972Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["CEO Interest","CS Top 10 (2018CQ2)","Category:Continuous Delivery","GitLab Starter","Product Vision FY20","Release::P2","UI text","UX","backend","cicd::active","customer","customer+","devops::release","direction","frontend","group::release","internal customer","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","pipeline","release post item::in review","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":94,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217451","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217451","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217451/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217451/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#217451","relative":"#217451","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#217451"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3278,"epic":{"id":52700,"iid":3278,"title":"Allow fork pipelines to run in parent project","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3278","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34437185,"iid":217450,"project_id":278964,"title":"ActionView::Template::Error: undefined method `can?' for nil:NilClass","description":"https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/1587940/?referrer=gitlab_plugin\n\n```\nNoMethodError: undefined method `can?' for nil:NilClass\n  ci/minutes/context.rb:22:in `can_see_status?'\n    user.can?(:create_pipeline, project)\n  ci/minutes/notification.rb:34:in `eligible_for_notifications?'\n    context.shared_runners_minutes_limit_enabled?

There is no validation to assert that the IP address has been stored or that the value is a valid IP address. \n\nWe would also have access to [postgres specific CIDR and IP address operators](https://www.endpoint.com/blog/2017/09/28/using-postgresql-cidr-and-inet-types) for additional filtering by subnet. This could be useful for self-hosted customers looking to see which part of a network an audited action came from.\n\nAlso see parent proposal: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220116\n\n### Proposal\n\nStore `ip_address` in a dedicated column for every AuditEvent (regardless of whether it is stored in the `details` hash).  This should probably use the `ip_address` Rails datatype as this will integrate closely with Ruby's native `IPAddr` class.\n\nAll instances where AuditEvent IP address is displayed to the user on the frontend should also be updated, but the actual output to the user both in views and APIs should be left unchanged.\n\n### Out of scope\n\n- Do not add an index for the new `ip_address` column.  An index [may be indexed in a future enhancement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217442#note_355375134).\n- Do not add a backfill migration for historical data, as there will be a single backfill migration per the [AuditEvent refactor](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2765)\n\n### Further details\n\nThis will need to include a data migration to move existing audit logs to use the new data structure.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-12T08:34:31.190Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T22:03:25.390Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T08:30:30.164Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::manage","group::compliance","maintenance::refactor","missed:13.1","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217442","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217442","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217442/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/217442/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#217442","relative":"#217442","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#217442"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2765,"epic":{"id":26374,"iid":2765,"title":"Refactor AuditEvent","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2765","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34433630,"iid":217439,"project_id":278964,"title":"Record request remote_ip on audit event","description":"The following discussion from !30970 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @stanhu started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/30970#note_340650167):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e I think this is the last IP used to sign-in by the user.

Internally, this changes the risk level associated with the ZAP alert to False Positive. This ensures that vulnerabilities are not added for the rule.\n\nA limitation of this approach is that the rule always executes, even though there it will create no vulnerabilities. This takes up unnecessary resources and time to execute the DAST scan. It creates confusion for users as the DAST log mentions that the rule passes.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nAnother approach should be identified to exclude rules. Rules should be completely excluded to ensure that they are never executed. One potential for this is to use ZAP Scan Policies.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

COTERMS .COM: - API call to pull user/seat data from GitLab.com","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUsers, particularly customers, often ask how they can see/count the number of unique members and see a list of them.\n\n### Target audience\n\nFinance/Billing, Group owner\n\n### Further details\n\nParticularly in the context of GitLab.com, two main reasons they ask for this:\n\n- align with subscription licensing number\n- access management\n\nCurrently, support will pull a report for customers upon request using a rails script. This is also not currently possible with a single API call.\n\n---\n### Proposal\n\nMake billable users which roll up to a group namespace accessible via the API. The billable members count is defined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/group.rb#L285)\n\n#### In the API include:\n\n1. Member Name \n1. Username\n1. ~~Email address - only display when the member has elected to display the email address publicly. (see example screenshot below)~~ UPDATE: email address will not be included in this iteration but will be addressed in a follow-up iteration.\n\nNice to have if this does not increase scope greatly:\n1. Role - where multiple, provide the highest role (eg. Developer is higher than Reporter)\n1. Highest Membership Location: The Group/Subgroup/Project where they were added. \n\n**Example:**\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n**Group X**: Members = **Red** (role: developer), **Yellow** (role: developer)\n1. **Subgroup 1**: Members = **Red** (role: developer), **Yellow** (role: developer), **Green** (owner)\n2. **Subgroup 2**: Members = **Red** (role: owner), **Yellow** (role: developer)\n     - **Project 000**: Members = **Red** (role: maintainer), **Yellow** (role: developer), **Purple** (maintainer)\n3. **Project YYY**: Members = **Red** (role: developer), **Yellow** (role: developer), **Blue** (reporter)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nExpected members w/ role and membership location provided in API:\n\n| Member Name | Role | Highest Membership location | \n| ---      |  :---------:  |:---------:|\n| Red   | Owner   | Subgroup 2   |\n| Yellow   | Developer   |  Group X  | \n| Green   | Owner   |  Subgroup 1  |\n| Purple   | Maintainer   |  Project 000  | \n| Blue   | Reporter   | Project YYY   |\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis is consistent with what group Owners can already do, but it requires viewing every project members list, or similar calls to the API. We are consulting legal [in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216307) to be sure we can provide the email address.\n\n### Documentation\n\nWould need to update:\n\n- [Groups and projects members API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- Group owners can match their subscription user count to the group members list via API.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Support tool: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/glgl\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/27074#note_257541284\n\n### Links /

Related to #36332 which updates the vulnerability modal. \n\nA user of DAST should be able to determine the source of a vulnerability. This information can be used to dismiss false positives, or resolve the vulnerability by making a change in the source code.\n\nThe issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36328 will ensure that the URL and the ZAProxy \"evidence\" is displayed to users on the Security Dashboard, Security Pipeline view and the MR widget. While useful as a MVP, there is more information that if displayed will enable a user to investigate vulnerabilities faster and with more precision.\n\nThese information includes:\n- The request method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, etc)\n- The response status code (e.g. `200`, `500`, `404`, etc)\n- All of the request headers (e.g. `accept: */*`)\n- All of the response headers (e.g. `x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN`)\n\n### Why is this information useful?\n\nThe request method is useful because different application code typically serves different method/URLs. For example, the request to `GET http://myserver.com/person` would be served by different code than a request to `POST http://myserver.com/person`. Without the method, the user will not know which place to resolve the vulnerability.\n\nThe response status code is useful because if a server returns an error, or a redirect, then different headers/body will be returned, resulting in different vulnerabilities. For example, if the user fails to login using the `DAST_AUTH_URL` fields the scan may continue to run, not scanning all of the pages as intended. A redirect to login from a page intended to serve content will flag this problem.\n\nThe request and response headers are useful because they often show the cause of a vulnerability (e.g. `X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing`). This allows the user to verify whether or not the vulnerability is a false positive or not. Users can also add custom headers, this will allow the user to verify they were sent as intended. An example of this use case is when adding basic auth to a request.\n\n### Why not also show the body?\n\nIn theory, this is also useful. Body sizes can be extremely large, for this reason it has been left out of this issue.

When users add a variable value with $ (which is very common for generated passwords), the value is treated as a variable reference, which isn't expected behavior. \n\nUsers find it surprising that the variable gets expanded by default when the value contains a $. Often times the value is machine generated and might contain a $ to make it more secure.\n\nNote that UX here includes both within the web UI and .gitlab-ci.yml.\n\nWe should consider the following: \n\n- all our predefined variables as `raw`, as they are constant by design: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html\n- all our masked variables as `raw` as we want to ensure that their content is never changed\n- allowing user to mark other variables as `raw`, considering that the `raw` should likely be by default\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve?

However, this would require changing the current product behavior. In order to start with a safer, smaller iteration we will add an optional setting to the variables in CI/CD settings to turn off variable expansion.\n\n**The scope of this issue is to only address the UI aspect of adding new variables in the project and group CI/CD variables settings.**\n\n#### MVC Scope\n\n- Add help text to the Value input field as in [this design.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217309/designs/Add_variable_-_Default.png)\n- Add an option \"Expand variable reference\" to the new variable form in the CI/CD variables settings. This setting will be turned on by default for all existing and new variables. User can turn it off manually when creating a new variable or editing an existing variable.\n- When user adds a value with $, update the alert text as in [this design.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217309/designs/Add_variable_-_Password_with__.png)\n- When user unselects \"Expand variable reference\", update the Value input help text as described in [this design.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217309/designs/Add_variable_-_Don_t_expand_this_variable.png)\n- The variables table should show if the variable is expanded or not.

However, the pages are visible publicly and don't require a login if the pages is visited in an incognito window.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. [Create a new project via the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#create-project). I used the following payload:\n\n    ```\n    name:pages-custom-access-control-bug-via-api\n    template_name:plainhtml\n    pages_access_level:private\n    ```\n2. Initiate a pipeline so the pages is deployed.\n\n3. Observe under **Settings \u003e General \u003e Visibility, project features, permissions \u003e Pages** that the setting is **Only Project Members**. In the Rails console, `Project.find(\u003cID\u003e).pages_access_level` is `30`, which is incorrect (it should be `10`).\n\n4.

Details can be found within https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/156226 (internal use). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAttempt to publish a NuGet package to the GitLab registry with a version containing *3 or more* periods. For example, a package with this version will not upload (though NuGet will claim it was uploaded successfully):\n\n```\n1.1.1.1\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/calebw/nuget_tests\n\nThe above package can be used to replicate the behavior. Simply adjust the version number within `nuget_tests/nuget_tests/nuget_tests.csproj`, create the package and attempt to push it to GitLab. \n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAfter attempting to push the package, NuGet will state the package was pushed, but nothing will be viewable within GitLab. Tailing the sidekiq logs while attempting to push will show the `ActiveRecord` error. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPackages should be uploaded and viewable successfully.\n\nIf this is intended behavior as a result of recent changes, then we should add documentation stating supported versioning conventions. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```\n==\u003e

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nBased on the desire to add support for the following languages\n\n* .Net Framework / Core (NuGet)\n* c++\n* c\n* C#\n\nPlease do some research and propose which should be the first to be researched and have a proof of concept done. POC can be either adding support ourselves, or integration of an OSS project\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe same as we have today for DS, just an additional supported language\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [x] write down a [list of requirements](#note_351881766) to add support for a new language/package manager\n- [x] investigate on implementing [Conan support in Gemnasium](#note_362250053) (C/C++)\n- [x] investigate on implementing [NuGet support in Gemnasium](#note_362248949) (.NET, C#)\n- ~~implement a PoC, either as part of the [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) analyzer, or using by integrating an existing Open Source tool~~\n\n### Discovery conclusion\n\n**Both NuGet and Conan can be supported, at a similar cost.**\n\nConan lock files `conan.lock` can be supported in Gemnasium. Users need to generate the lock file using `conan graph lock`, and `conan.lock` to their repo.\n\nNuGet lock files `packages.lock.json` can be supported in Gemnasium. Users need to configure their .NET project to [enable lock files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#enabling-lock-file), and add `packages.lock.json` to their repo. This feature is available [with NuGet 4.9 or above and with Visual Studio 2017 15.9 or above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#enabling-lock-file).\n\nLock file support involves:\n- implementing a lock file parser in [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium)\n- adding a [test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests) using this lock, and use it for QA\n- updating the list of [supported languages and package managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#supported-languages-and-package-managers)\n\nDependency file support (as opposed to lock file) could later be implemented by running `conan` or `nuget` to generate the lock file before parsing it. This lock file parsers would be reused.\n\n### Links /

This issue is an MVC of the desired implementation found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/27074\n\n\n___\n\n## MVC Proposal\n\nOn the parent group billing page, beneath the current subscription table, create a collapsible list of members who tie to the `Seats currently in use value`.\n\n### In the table include:\n\n1. Member Name (first, last)\n1. Username\n1. Email address - only if the email address is publicly available, otherwise display `private`\n1. ~~IP~~ _we should not serve up this information per legal_\n1. This information will only be accessible by members of the parent group with `owner` permissions\n\n### Rules\n\n1. Only display a member once if they are members of multiple subgroups/projects\n1. Display only billable members. Exclude GitLab generated bots (Support Bot, Alert Bot), Ghost Users, and Users with Guest permissions if the namespace subscribes to the Gold plan.\n1. Include members invited from shared groups as long as they meet the conditions in rule 2.\n1. The data should be updated dynamically as changes to the members in the instance are made. If this is too draining, let's update once a day and include a hover text which states that the table is updated at xx:xx time daily (including the timezone).\n\n### Testing \u0026 Availability\nTests should cover scenarios defined in `Rules` section, and following \n1. list only displays for root group with subscription\n1. list can only be retrieved for members with owner permission\n1. email displayed as `private` is member doesn't set public email\n1. list is paginated with a default order\n1. members removed from 1 of the subgroups they belong to still included in list \n\n### Documentation\n\nWould need to update:\n\n- [Groups docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/), currently has nothing on Members list in general, only [adding users to group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#add-users-to-a-group)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- Group owners can match their subscription user count to the group members list via UI.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-07T17:56:06.433Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T02:21:50.822Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T00:28:16.987Z","closed_by":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"labels":["Deliverable","Engineering","Fulfillment Priority","[deprecated] Category:Provision","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","link::child issue","quad-planning::complete-action","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"}],"author":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216996","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216996","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216996/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216996/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216996","relative":"#216996","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216996"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4547,"epic":{"id":121875,"iid":4547,"title":"GitLab.com Billable Members List","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4547","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34275872,"iid":216995,"project_id":278964,"title":"Drop support for `license_management` artifact","description":"**FEATURE FLAG**\n\n`drop_license_management_artifact`\n\n-----\n\nParent issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8912\n\nWe need to drop support for `license_management`.

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\nGroups owners feel confident that their intellectual property is safe. Group members receive clear explanations about why they can't fork. There is a clear alternative path for them to follow to do their work. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nFor groups, a group Owner should be able to toggle whether or not forks can be created outside of the group in the top level group. The setting should be inherited down to all projects in that subgroup.\n\n* When enabled, creating a fork should only be allowed if the fork is created inside the group.\n* When disabled, group members should be able to fork anywhere.\n* Option should be available for Silver level and above.\n\nThis option should be disabled by default (changing behavior of existing groups is not desired).\nNote that this restriction would only apply to attempts to create new forks and won't affect any existing forks that are already in personal namespaces, which we should make clear in the documentation. This setting should inherit down a group hierarchy just like the \"Private\" setting.\n\n### Further details\n\nAs part of this change, we should remove this option from the Managed Accounts section so there's not 2 places to do the same thing. This option should be available to both private and public groups. It should only be able to be applied in the top level group and the setting flows down to all projects underneath.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis will live within group settings so the same permission rules apply as with other options there.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n**What risks does this change pose to our availability?**\n\nThis feature does would not affect GitLab.com or self managed instance's availability as a whole. In the worst case, forking might get be disabled for all users.\n\n**What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?**\n\n* When forking restriction is disabled on a group:\n  * Any user should be able to fork a project. (Existing functionality and should be already covered by tests)\n\n* When forking restriction is enabled on a group:\n  * A user (including owner) should not be able to fork a project to outside of group.\n  * All users should should be able to fork a project to inside of the group.\n  * A user (including owner) should not be able to fork a project in a sub-group to outside of group.\n\nTests should be added [for the fork API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#fork-project) as well.\n\nNew end-to-end tests are not needed as the coverage at lower level should be enough. However, we should ensure existing end-to-end tests are green by running the `package-and-qa` manual job.\n\n### Links / references\nExisting Functionality in Projects:\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-07_at_2.47.18_PM](/uploads/cb837e9d67dfde420787788aa50ccef3/Screen_Shot_2020-05-07_at_2.47.18_PM.png)\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/#outer-forks-restriction-for-group-managed-accounts\n\n\nOther providers:\n* https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-forks-in-bitbucket-server-776639958.html\n\n## Issue readiness\n\n* [x] Product: issue description is accurate with an acceptable proposal for an MVC\n* [x] Engineering: issue is implementable with few remaining questions, is sufficiently broken down, and is able to be estimated","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-07T16:27:55.817Z","updated_at":"2022-03-05T16:08:10.061Z","closed_at":"2020-08-04T13:57:34.843Z","closed_by":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"},"labels":["GitLab Premium","backend","devops::manage","direction","group::authentication and authorization","quad-planning::complete-action","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"}],"author":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216987","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216987","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216987/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216987/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216987","relative":"#216987","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216987"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3191,"epic":{"id":47957,"iid":3191,"title":"Workspace Isolation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3191","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34272638,"iid":216979,"project_id":278964,"title":"Link to failed test screenshot in Test Details Modal","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\n[Sasha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) and the team have worked to create browser tests using [Selenium and Webdriver.io](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/end_to_end_testing_webdriverio/#selenium-and-webdriverio).

\"hard-coded\" and any new replicable items will need to be manually added.

Users publish and pull images using GitLab CI/CD, the command line, or the GitLab API. \n\nOften, users would like to understand more detail about a specific tag but currently there isn't a good way to view these details in the user interface.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nImprove the experience surrounding understanding specific image tag details.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd an expandable detail view (similar to the commit message on the commit UI) that allows users to see more details around a tag, including the specific image repository, date, time, and the manifest ID.\n\n| Image Repository list view with closed details |\n|---|\n| ![Add_the_detail_expansion_UI_component](/uploads/a0cce0bcffa41264261fa51681a69a57/Add_the_detail_expansion_UI_component.png) |\n\n|Image Repository list view with open details |\n|---|\n| ![Add_the_detail_expansion_UI_component__OPEN](/uploads/8ab97ad5b3620e63a69fc1dda7028283/Add_the_detail_expansion_UI_component__OPEN.png) |\n\n### Further details\n\nThe major focus of this issue is to create the UI moment of an expandable tag detail view.

to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen using workhorse, Project import **via the UI** uses the setting `Gitlab::CurrentSettings.max_attachment_size` which the user can set in the admin settings: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8160ad36/app/controllers/import/gitlab_projects_controller.rb#L41-41\n\n`.../admin/application_settings/general`\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-07_at_1.20.04_PM](/uploads/8d8ce4a4a55c7f43c9a8409a9cf51481/Screen_Shot_2020-05-07_at_1.20.04_PM.png)\n\n\nThis setting should govern the max attachment size for attachments to entities like issues, not to the entire size of the export. In the Project import API, we use a constant of `50 megabytes` instead: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8160ad36/lib/api/project_import.rb#L7-7\n\nWe should align both these endpoints to use the same value, and not base this on the attachment size.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Export a project with a size larger than 10mb\n1.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe Package stage allows you to publish, consume, and discover images, all in one place. Users publish and pull images using GitLab CI/CD, the command line, or the GitLab API. \n\nWhen users have long tag names, or a large number of tags, the current table view is often cumbersome to work within. \n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nImprove the experience of viewing the tags held inside an image repository.\n\n### Proposal\n\nConvert the current UI from using the table UI component over to the list view component.\n\n| Image repository detail view |\n|---|\n| ![Convert_table_view_to_list_view](/uploads/5d34125269654592df5b2b769a09f581/Convert_table_view_to_list_view.png) |\n\n| Image repository detail view w/ active delete |\n|---|\n|![Convert_Table_to_List_+_Selected_for_Delete](/uploads/322eaefcbde2364e46961c32fe4ea5d0/Convert_Table_to_List_+_Selected_for_Delete.png)|\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the process of converting to the list view, the multi-select delete also has some improvements, including utilizing a light blue highlight to selected list items and shifting from the trashcan icon button over to a `Delete selected` button.\n\nUsers have often mentioned some initial confusion on the disabled multi-select delete button. After introducing the image repository delete button the \"Delete selected\" verbiage will also help clarify the different delete utilities. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly.

See [node/lib/resolve.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/1aba081b5d5363add13710edeb470d5eb4f3c914/node/lib/resolve.js#L62) and [read-installed.js#L175](https://github.com/npm/read-installed/blob/master/read-installed.js#L175).\n\n[quoting @ifrenkel](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33323#note_336859655):\n\n\u003e there seems to be discussion about replacing `read-installed`: https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/issues/241#issuecomment-404292287\n\u003e\n\u003e `retire.js` used to have a more robust method of figuring out installed dependencies (`npm` itself) but was replaced because of the bloat of using `npm`: https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/issues/16\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n- [ ] Add a local dependencies to [tests/js-npm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm), and make sure QA passes.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] Dependency Scanning docs say there's a limitation when `Referencing local dependencies using a path in JavaScript projects`, and this limitation needs to be removed.

The ~backend issue for this MVC found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216996\n1. This issue is an MVC of the desired implementation found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/27074\n\n___\n\n## MVC Proposal\n\nOn the parent group billing page, beneath the current subscription table, create a list of members who tie to the `Seats currently in use value`.\n\nThis has to be under the `api_billable_member_list` feature flag.\n\n### In the table include:\n\n1. Member Name (first, last)\n1. Username\n1. ~~Email address - only display when the member has elected to display the email address publicly. (see example screenshot below)~~ UPDATE: email address will not be included in this iteration but will be addressed in a follow-up iteration.\n1. ~~IP~~ _we should not serve up this information per legal_\n1. This information will only be accessible by members of the parent group with `owner` permissions\n\n### Rules\n\n1. 20 members per page\n1. Only display a member once if they are members of multiple subgroups/projects\n1. Display only billable members. Exclude GitLab generated bots (Support Bot, Alert Bot), Ghost Users, and Users with Guest permissions if the namespace subscribes to the Gold plan.\n1. Include members invited from shared groups as long as they meet the conditions in rule 2.\n1. The data should be updated dynamically as changes to the members in the instance are made. If this is too draining, let's update once a day and include a hover text which states that the table is updated at xx:xx time daily (including the timezone).\n\n### Documentation\n\nWould need to update:\n\n- [Groups docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/), currently has nothing on Members list in general, only [adding users to group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#add-users-to-a-group)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- Group owners can match their subscription user count to the group members list via UI.\n\n### Additional information\n\nOnly display email if the user has elected to publicly display it:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-18_at_8.42.16](/uploads/8979b2233760992720ea7d7b365b425a/Screen_Shot_2020-05-18_at_8.42.16.png)\n\n## ROI\n\n* [ ] IACV \n* [ ] Cost Reduction\n* [x] Sales Efficiency: [$50k in first 90-days post implementation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLu95rdXLa1Y9zq5oI86AAneVsdMctB7NA7EAb7UgLM/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [ ] Other\n* [x] Support Efficiency\n\n## TODOs \n- [x] New route - set it up\n- [x] User count per page - agree on number (ATM 20 is the consensus - discussion [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216899#note_425573777))\n- [x] Billings table uses daily snapshot data / Seats table uses live data - [discussion here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216899#note_425585369)\n  - [x] Add explanatory text about this (consensus ATM on *The table data is refreshed live. This contrasts with the billing table, which refreshes once per day.* - [discussion here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216899#note_426198120))\n- [ ] When the table is on the bottom of the billing page, it conditionally shows only if there are billable users. However, when the table is on its own page, it needs to always show up and just show an empty state if there are no users.([discussion here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216899#note_425759222))\n- [x] Put the feature under the feature flag `api_billable_member_list`\n- [ ] Tests\n- [ ] MR that removes the feature flag\n- [ ] Docs\n- [ ] Open follow-ups\n  - [x] Add email\n  - [ ] (?)

The ability to more easily remove labels will also appear on Merge Requests.\n\n### Links / references\n1. [Show applied labels at the top](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17361) to at least reduce the need to browse the list\n1. Remove filter functionality on-click and instead make a click disassociate the label from that issue. (Would need to understand: Is it really adding value to make the label's on-click functionality take the user to a new screen that shows all issues filtered by that label? This would be changing an existing user pattern to a very different flow. What is the expectation on the user's part for clicking on labels within issues?)\n1. Display an X-to-remove or single [click removal process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33379)\n\n### Release Notes\n\nRemoving a label from an Issue is a pretty clunky workflow that requires three clicks, fetching a fresh list of labels from the server, and using a search box to find the label you want to remove. Not only is this unintuitive, it's not efficient given labels are removed from Issues approximately 55,000 times per day costing the wider community over 900 minutes of precious time. It may not be [revolutionary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#boring-solutions), but you can now remove an Issue's label with a single click. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#assign-and-unassign-labels\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-07T00:03:06.231Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:03:42.408Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T11:03:44.839Z","closed_by":{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","Deliverable","GitLab Core","GitLab Premium","GitLab Starter","GitLab Ultimate","closed::complete","devops::plan","direction","documentation","frontend","group::project management","labels","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"}],"author":{"id":5031341,"username":"mikelong","name":"Mike Long","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5031341/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikelong"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"},"user_notes_count":61,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216881","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216881","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216881/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216881/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216881","relative":"#216881","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216881"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3220,"epic":{"id":50771,"iid":3220,"title":"Improve Labels","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3220","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 22, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34239281,"iid":216880,"project_id":278964,"title":"FY21-Q2 IACV - UX :: Sticky Issue Titles","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Some languages lack proofreaders. Some languages were translated by translators who are not GitLab users, which leads to lesser quality translations.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThere seems to be an untapped source of translations - GitLab users who are using non-English UI. Currently, we have 10k+ users who selected French, German, Japanese (and few others), but only a handful of contributing translators. \n\nDepending on a user's language preference, invite them to contribute to translations. The invite could be tailored to each language, such as finding users who would vote up/down existing translations in languages that have a high number of translations, but not many proofreaders.\n\nWe can also add this invitation whenever we end up asking for feedback on the translation into a specific language.\n\n### MVC Solution\n\nPut a link on https://gitlab.com/-/profile/preferences under \"Localization\":\n\n```\nThis feature is experimental and translations are not complete yet.\n\u003ca href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/i18n/translation.html\"\u003eHelp translate GitLab to your language.\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nAn alternative solution was proposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352410.\n\n## Implementation Guide\n\nImplement the **MVC Solution**, as described above.\n\n* [ ] Add `\u003ca href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/i18n/translation.html\"\u003eHelp translate GitLab to your language.\u003c/a\u003e` to https://gitlab.com/-/profile/preferences, under `Localization`\n* [ ] Externalize the string `Help translate GitLab to your language.`","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-06T16:37:28.668Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T11:38:06.608Z","closed_at":"2022-08-11T08:47:13.976Z","closed_by":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"labels":["Category:Internationalization","Hackathon","Seeking community contributions","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::manage","feature::addition","frontend","good for new contributors","group::import","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":12213465,"username":"paarth551","name":"Paarth Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dafa9886cb589ac63d671dbab53ca926?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/paarth551"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":12213465,"username":"paarth551","name":"Paarth Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dafa9886cb589ac63d671dbab53ca926?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/paarth551"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216842","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216842","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216842/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216842/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216842","relative":"#216842","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216842"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3199,"epic":{"id":49396,"iid":3199,"title":"Improve Current Translations","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3199","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34226004,"iid":216832,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Form fields discussion","description":"## Context\n\nHi @geo-team, I would like to get your feedback on the possible value for each form on Geo UI.\nIt seems like we don't have a strict rule for each form field as a limitation.\n\nIf we could set the rule, it would be very helpful to make some progress on this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213732.\n\n## Rules on forms\n\n### Editing a primary node\n\n![Screenshot_2020-05-06_at_17.36.31](/uploads/383c1a31c9a5b9bf77a3c1a652d3471f/Screenshot_2020-05-06_at_17.36.31.png)\n\n| Input type | Field name | Possible value range | Default value |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | \n| Text | Node name | Max characters: `255` | -
