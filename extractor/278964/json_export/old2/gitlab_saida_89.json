(For our project, this output exceeds the allowed length of a log, which means we couldn't see the end of the output, which is the part which would have explained the problem)\n* The job continues as if there were no packages found, so it appears to succeed but no packages appear in the license report\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nEither: the job should fail, so the user knows there is a problem\n\nOr: the job should print a warning about the unmet peer dependencies, and continue to analyse the licenses for the rest of the installed packages. (This is the behaviour of the LicenseFinder gem, which is taken out by the license-finder image's monkeypatches).\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com \n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWhen there are unmet peer dependencies, the LicenseFinder gem attempts to continue: https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/lib/license_finder/package_managers/npm.rb#L39\n\nThe license-finder image monkeypatches this class. It ignores the error and returns an empty hash here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/license-finder/-/blob/main/lib/license/finder/ext/npm.rb#L37\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/license-finder/-/blob/main/lib/license/finder/ext/npm.rb#L37 add check for `status.exitstatus = 1` (status for unmet peer dependencies), continue parsing in case of this positive condition.\n1.

see information for and manage the tokens that have been created for the cluster `agentk` connection to GitLab's `kas` agent. In the UI they should be able to identify each token in the list, see that the expected tokens are active, the tokens that pose security concerns have been revoked, which tokens have been used and which have expired. They should also be able to see further information such as when a token was created and by who. In addition, the user should be able to create new tokens from this page without having to navigate to another page.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### Information\n\n**Top level info**\n\n- The Agent name + numeric agent id\n- The Agent connection status\n- Which cluster the Agent is installed on (optional)\n- User who installed the Agent and when the Agent was installed.\n- The Agent version.\n- Kubernetes version.\n- Date Agent last contacted GitLab.\n- Agent Namespace.\n\n\n**Tooltips**\n\n- A warning icon if the Agent version is older than the kas version with a tooltip prompting the user to update the Agent version and the reasons).\n- For the connection status \"Not connected\" and \"Never connected\" show a **popover** explaining possible reasons and including a link to the troubleshooting docs.\n- For Connected status a tooltip with the relative date/time that the connection was established.\n- A tooltip will be shown on hover of the **Namespace** and will explain that it's the Agent namespace.\n\n**Token list**\n\nAdd a list of tokens that have been created for the cluster `agentk` connection to GitLab's `kas` agent.

which will trial information and an upgrade CTA - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288015\n* [x] Open the hover modal at specific days remaining in the trial to remind users they need to upgrade to maintain paid feature access - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288016\n \n## Experiment tracking\n\nWe'll run this experiment at 50% where 50% of namespaces in the experiment group will get this experience described above and 50% of users will get the control experience which by the time this experiment launches should include the MVC active trial status where it displays the time remaining in the trial and clicking on the item brings the user to the billing page. \n \nIn the control group, we'll track clicks on the trial status option. \n \nIn the experiment group we'll want to track:\n \n**On hover**\n\n* Hovers that trigger the module to open \n* Clicks within the active trial module per CTA from a user that hovered\n \n**When we open the module at predetermined time intervals**\n\n* Module opens due to time remaining in the trial \n* Clicks when the module was opened with specific time remaining in the trial \n* closures of the module (when a user does not select one of the primary CTAs)\n  * Note Ideally we also capture the clicks and closures here if they occurred either at the 14 day or 3 days remaining in the trial as additional context within the events as this will help us understand if either warning is more valuable to the user.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-14T16:10:31.411Z","updated_at":"2021-08-29T21:39:15.841Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T17:43:54.818Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas

child pipeline with `strategy: depend` and any jobs fail in the child pipeline the parent pipeline becomes stuck. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41930 addressed the parent pipeline not getting updated when the child job was retried but this doesn't address the the fact that the parent pipeline won't continue, even after the child successfully passes. Below is a demo, the child pipeline jobs are simple bash scripts that exit either 0 or 1 randomly. The child pipeline fails and if you replay those jobs they eventually pass and the parent is updated as \"passed\" but the parent pipeline won't continue to the next stage.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nStart a pipeline with the .yml files outlined in the following repo: https://gitlab.com/learoy.klinginsmith/ci-test/-/tree/master\n\n### Example Project\nhttps://gitlab.com/learoy.klinginsmith/ci-test/-/tree/master\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/learoy.klinginsmith/ci-test/-/pipelines/241400949\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nWhen a child pipeline fails and is restarted, then runs successfully, the parent is updated to a \"passed\" state but the next stage in the parent pipeline is never executed.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nWhen the child pipeline fails and is restarted, then runs successfully, the parent pipeline should proceed to the next stage.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n![image](/uploads/6241c686769397543c729cfeedc8b198/image.png)\n![image](/uploads/6d7311d22cf5b4e0cd1ca4627cadc7ce/image.png)\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\nThis bug happens on 13.6.3-ee as well as Gitlab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-14T02:18:05.505Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T17:58:39.812Z","closed_at":"2021-05-11T20:33:28.779Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","automation:ml","backend","customer","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":7988843,"username":"learoy.klinginsmith","name":"Lea Roy Klinginsmith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/490e829c764fbc953395865caccd49dd?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/learoy.klinginsmith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":14,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297678","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297678","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297678/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297678/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297678","relative":"#297678","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297678"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":77191554,"iid":297665,"project_id":278964,"title":"Spoofing commit author for signed commits","description":"**[HackerOne report #1077019](https://hackerone.com/reports/1077019)** by `subbotin` on 2021-01-12, assigned to @rchan-gitlab:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nLabel \"Verified\" for signed commits not checks email for x509 signs.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nInstruction for linux, but it can be useful for reproducing on over OS.  \n1. Create valid x509 certificate for some email (I use https://www.actalis.it/en/certificates-for-secure-electronic-mail.aspx because it's only one service which makes free mime certs).   \n1. Import cert to storage `gpgsm --import PKCS12_Credential_new@fake.email.pfx`  \n1. Create .gitconfig like \n\n```  \n[user]  \n\temail = new@fake.email  \n\tname = target_account_on_gitlab_name  \n\tsigningkey = 0xBFD04A72 # (you key id from previous step. can be find by `gpgsm -k`)  \n[commit]  \n\tgpgsign = true  \n[gpg]  \n\tprogram = gpgsm  \n```  \n1. make new commit and push it to gitlab.  \n1. go to page https://gitlab.com/group_name/project_name/-/commits/master and looks on bages  \n1. for better picture you can change avatar via gravatar.com\n\n#####  Impact\n\nSomeone with compromised ssh key but not compromised GPG key or x509 cert.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/mr_tron/test/-/commits/master  \nYou can see on this page two commits:   \nBoth made by me, both has label \"Verified\". They looks identically (only one difference - link under commit name. one follows on my gitlab account, and second is just \"mailto:my@email\").  Both commits signed by x509 MIME certificate. Initial commit I signed with my certificate issued to my email denis@subbot.in which I use for registration on gitlab.org, but second commit is signed by certificate issued to random temporary email (not really random - that's my old email, but i never mentioned it on gitlab.org).   \nGithub.com for example in this situation adds label \"Unverified\". Look on two last commits on this page - https://github.com/mr-tron/test-sign-x509/commits/master\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitlab display commits signed by x509 certificate for any email like Verified  \nAlso it displays login for gitlab users detected based on login in same manner as \"user.name\" from commit info.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIt should should display label \"Signed\" or \"Unverified\" and not green color.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nIn attachments.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens me on gitlab.org\n\n####  Impact\n\nAttacker can impersonate someone else in gitlab web interface.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_2021-01-12_16-28-54.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/bdaf53bf-9bc4-48e3-8413-a181b1ba751b/Screenshot_2021-01-12_16-28-54.png)\n* [Screenshot_2021-01-12_16-29-43.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/24390e51-b22e-4d6b-81d8-1de0d0fb220f/Screenshot_2021-01-12_16-29-43.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-13T23:04:21.236Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T12:39:04.034Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T10:21:11.194Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-840","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-04-13","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297665","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297665","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297665/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297665/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297665","relative":"#297665","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297665"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77191302,"iid":297664,"project_id":278964,"title":"Maintain data parity between ExperimentUser \u0026 ExperimentSubject","description":"Since [the addition of the `ExperimentSubject` model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47042) – meant to eventually be a full replacement for the limited `ExperimentUser` model – the `ExperimentUser` model has been given some extra data columns.

Then pick one piece of that data, and keeping in mind the longer term goals, design and do a POC to add some of the data that would give us one or more of the customer features listed below (also feel free to add features!)\n\nPS - you may want to look at the epic - https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5199\n\n### Outcome\n\nA short term proposal for additional data to be stored and a longer term list of data that we would need to have in order to be able to accomplish all the features we currently would like to implement.\n\nWe should review the design with ~\"Database Engineering\" and ~\"Category:Vulnerability Database\" for validation of both short and long term goals as we know and understand them today. We may also identify other teams that share some of our short or long term data goals and we should identify that to coordinate where possible on those items.\n\nIn the end we will only implement *a small subset* of tables and columns needed with the intent that considering the future we will reduce the number of migrations or other painful steps as we enhance the database to add all the features over time.\n\n## Customer Features\n\nupcoming customer features I want soonest - and order will be decided by this proof of concept/plan\n- spdx/sbom\n- alerting users if the location changes (dependency confusion)\n- looking at pulling in package hunter\n- alerting a new cve on existing dependency\n- grouping findings as from same introduced dependency\n\n### Information about project dependencies\n\n#### Tracking the source of a package\n- (new) where it usually comes from (spot dependency confusion/change)\n\n#### Explaining how a dependency relates to the project itself\n- Show (one of) dependency paths (for the purpose of looking at a dependency or a vulnerability and going \"where did this come from?\")\n- Show (many/all) dependency paths? (is this valuable?)\n- Show dependency graph\n\n#### Querying dependencies\n- As a customer I want to know what dependencies (and versions) are in each of my projects, and their licenses (list and search)\n- As a customer I want to know what dependencies (and versions) are in each of my GROUPS of projects, and their licenses (list and search)\n- As a customer I want to know what dependencies (and versions) are in each of my INSTANCES, and their licenses  and dependency (and version) (list and search)\n- As a customer i may wish to associate versions of my list of dependencies to versions so if one of my users asks for a license list in a specific (older) version i can provide that to them.\n\n#### Tracking changes in dependencies\n- As a customer i may wish to be able to see dependencies merged into \"main\" versus \"feature branches\"\n\n#### Exporting a SBoM\n- being able to easily generate project, or workspace level exports of all dependencies (SBOM)\n- we'll want these to be associated with licenses as much as possible (for SBOM)\n\n### Notify about new vulnerabilities affecting project dependencies\n\n(previously was \"the relationship of project dependencies to vulnerabilities\")\n\n- Alert/inform customers when *existing* dependencies have newly identified findings (i.e. compare Dependency List vs newly added entries to vuln DB) ideally without needing a pipeline (just maybe a chron job or something). we may need to assume the vuln db is also a real db for this feature.\n\n### Notify about important changes affecting project dependencies\n\n(previously was \"package data (info, risk, etc)\")\n\n- We want to be able to inform users of new risks (EOL) and opportunities (Newly released version (minor or major)) again hopefully without needing a pipeline\n- we want to inform users of other things (changed maintainer) that we find of note related to their dependencies\n\n### policies\n- we want to be able to at any time query out of compliance dependencies and if they were approved or not as exceptions (i.e. added before policies put in place for example) i.e. these have critial vulns and we don't allow that - these have denied licenses - and this list should say what dependency, version, project(s), and who/when the exception was made (ref an MR approval or MR whichever has an audit log?)\n- customers should be able to add a list of denied and allowed dependencies (by specific version, all version, equal to or earlier version than X) which would trigger MR approvals, as well as the exception reports above, AND be able to be shared (the allow/deny list) with ~\"Category:Dependency Firewall\" and ~\"Category:Dependency Proxy\" and be able to be applied at a project, group, tag, or instance level (aka they should create lists, then have a mechanism to apply that policy list that can change as needed and reference that policy list as a whole set) i.e. should also be able to exempt one occurance\n\n## Considerations\n- must work self hosted and saas\n- most work offline\n- space should be considered what is the minimal data we can store and still accomplish our goals.\n- must be permissioned properly so that no one can edit/add/remove/view data unless that is an expected or known condition - we may wish to wok with permissions team as permissions are not yet RBAC/granular and we may wish to implement separate persmissioning on top\n- needs to have reasonable call limits to prevent abuse\n- needs to be performant (may occur after spike but we may need to index or other things and caching?)\n- we will need to report on the used size for the charge out / limits projects","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-13T22:28:54.796Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T11:17:35.277Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T16:16:47.783Z","closed_by":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","missed:14.1","missed:14.3","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":3913516,"username":"NicoleSchwartz","name":"Nicole Schwartz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3913516/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NicoleSchwartz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":240,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-10-05","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297661","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297661","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297661/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297661/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297661","relative":"#297661","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297661"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5199,"epic":{"id":180437,"iid":5199,"title":"Dependency Scanning \u0026 License Compliance -

There are many problems with this described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3217 but a major motivating factor for moving to indices for each data type is performance. Based on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3217#note_399228783 we can reduce the total response time of searches for issues by `54%` if those issues are in a dedicated index rather than the combined index with all the other data types.\n\nWe will likely see similar benefits for other data types but we should just start with 1 data type for now to iterate and learn at each point.\n\n## Solution\n\nMove the notes to a dedicated index. This will have several challenges that we need to overcome and may require several MRs to accomplish.\n\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Denormalise the notes permission data per https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2054 . This may be done over a few MRs:\n   1. Denormalise the project issues, merge requests, snippets, and repository visibility level and project visibility level onto the notes document type. This requires a migration to update all the existing notes with this field. It also requires triggering an notes update whenever the project permissions change.\n   1. Change project and group-wide searches to use the new denormalized fields along side the inline permission (ie. just `confidential` field) and the existing `project_id` field already on the notes.\n   1. Change global searches to use the new denormalized fields rather than the join to parent\n1. Add support for setting the `notes` used when indexing based on the record type (the bulk indexers all hardcode `gitlab-\u003cENV\u003e` that will need to change. We can still use the single bulk indexer since bulk indexing can support to writing to multiple indices.\n1. Add a migration that pauses indexing, moves the notes over to the new index, ensures reads and writes for notes  are now coming from the new index and then deletes the notes from the existing index\n\n## Proposal (issues will be opened for each)\n\nThese should be done in order unless otherwise noted\n\n1. De-normalize the notes (comments) permission data and update notes when permission data changes.  \u003c-- will include migration\n1. Remove joins from the Elasticsearch query for project/group scoped notes (comments) search\n1. Remove joins from the Elasticsearch query for globally scoped notes (comments) search\n1.

View multiple incidents at the same time to ensure everything is being addressed\n\n\n## Impact\n\nStreamlining this experience will increase adoption of the Incident Management feature set and address numerous outstanding external and internal feature sets.\n\n## Confidence\n\nWe have high confidence that investing effort into this experience is critical to the success of Incident Management based on:\n\n- External customer feature requests\n- Internal customer feature requests\n- Analyst calls - integrating incident management into a workflow tool is the direction the market is going (see [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ttB1Py-lcku23eBN_3PfGISDvPvlrmnu-6FubpPhNYo/edit) from call with Forrester)\n\n## Related feature requests\n- Filter issue boards by issue type\n- Change issue type\n- No milestones on issues\n\n## Target Customer Conversations\n- Benoit, SIG Member\n- Brent, GitLab SRE team\n\n[Discussion guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q-iH2f0upoXaEcKOjPSyLT3-fzv3x8IAJdcS2JCCF3U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Dovetail project](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/90bad273-3be2-4188-9a82-352b25ff5940/readme)\n\n[Notes doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtbmMWpz8Rc42cKKMvroPMtzAIuTLAmKheQjeh2e6cM/edit?usp=sharing)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-13T17:49:32.809Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T16:27:33.659Z","closed_at":"2021-02-11T03:16:28.413Z","closed_by":{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"},"labels":["Category:Incident Management","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops","workflow::problem validation"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"}],"author":{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297594","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297594","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297594/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297594/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297594","relative":"#297594","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297594"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5355,"epic":{"id":198497,"iid":5355,"title":"Managing Incidents on issues boards","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5355","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79205560,"iid":321695,"project_id":278964,"title":"High database query timings when canceling pending pipelines","description":"This is coming from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/12326#note_484146016, where a problematic query has been identified.

Make sure to enable the feature flag locally to test your changes. \n\n```javascript\nconst mountSearchSettings = async () =\u003e {\n  const el = document.querySelector('.js-search-settings-app');\n\n  if (el) {\n    const { default: initSearch } = await import(\n      /* webpackChunkName: 'search_settings' */ '~/search_settings'\n    );\n    initSearch({ el });\n  }\n};\n\nmountSearchSettings();\n```\n\nThis JavaScript snippet will asynchronously load the search settings application only if the `search_settings` haml partial renders the application’s entry point element.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-13T15:57:45.963Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T13:08:07.243Z","closed_at":"2021-03-17T13:05:30.026Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"labels":["Category:Navigation \u0026 Settings","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"}],"author":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297550","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297550","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297550/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297550/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297550","relative":"#297550","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297550"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5176,"epic":{"id":179340,"iid":5176,"title":"Add search to Group \u0026 Project settings","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5176","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77171433,"iid":297548,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create a tool to output checksums of repository refs","description":"### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nSys admins may need to compare references of git repositories between copies.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

one involving the ci_builds and deployments tables, the other just involving multiple updates to ci_builds, [which I've raised as a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297495).\n\nAssigned this to ~\"group::release\" because it involves the table `deployments` where as the other one could affect any pipeline.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n### Example Project\n\nCustomer's project involved long pipelines, and lots of jobs tagged with `environment`.\n\nWhen an earlier job fails, a lot of jobs would then get cancelled, and this has the effect of cancelling as lot of deployments as well.\n\nI created a simplified version of this to try to reproduce it, unsuccessfully - the pipeline was set to run frequently on a schedule, but no deadlocks occurred.\n\n[gitlab-ci.yml](/uploads/5c69567d1e3ac627254d2468639af9b7/gitlab-ci.yml)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n@pbair in ~\"group::database\" looked into this:\n\nWhen a build is failed:\n\n```\n[51] pry(main)\u003e b.drop!\n   (0.3ms)  BEGIN\n  Deployment Update (0.5ms)  UPDATE \"deployments\" SET \"updated_at\" = '2020-12-15 18:41:15.967273', \"status\" = 3, \n         \"finished_at\" = '2020-12-15 18:41:15.964140' WHERE \"deployments\".\"id\" = 34\n  Ci::Build Update (0.5ms)  UPDATE \"ci_builds\" SET \"status\" = 'failed', \"finished_at\" = '2020-12-15 18:41:15.960797', \n         \"updated_at\" = '2020-12-15 18:41:15.970301', \"processed\" = FALSE, \"lock_version\" = 4 WHERE \"ci_builds\".\"id\" = 14 \n         AND \"ci_builds\".\"lock_version\" = 3\n   (0.7ms)  COMMIT\n```\n\nwhile when the build is skipped/canceled, it instead does:\n\n```\n[63] pry(main)\u003e b.skip\n   (0.2ms)  BEGIN\n  Ci::Build Update (0.7ms)  UPDATE \"ci_builds\" SET \"status\" = 'skipped', \"updated_at\" = '2020-12-15 19:12:03.676005', \n          \"processed\" = FALSE, \"lock_version\" = 8 WHERE \"ci_builds\".\"id\" = 14 AND \"ci_builds\".\"lock_version\" = 7\n  Deployment Update (0.4ms)  UPDATE \"deployments\" SET \"updated_at\" = '2020-12-15 19:12:03.680070', \"status\" = 4, \n          \"finished_at\" = '2020-12-15 19:12:03.679611' WHERE \"deployments\".\"id\" = 34\n   (0.7ms)  COMMIT\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nTransactions should be sequenced the same way to avoid deadlocks.  \n\nWhen running sql statement logging, I couldn't see why the same records would be updated, on either table.  So, I'm missing an element of what's needed to reproduce this.\n\nIgnoring that, and just looking at the deadlock errors, it seems like a job failing is triggering updates along the following lines:\n\n```\njob A fails -\u003e lock CI record -\u003e lock deployment record -\u003e commit\n                       |--deadlock--|\n     commit \u003c- lock CI record \u003c- lock deployment record \u003c- job B gets skipped \u003c- Job A fails\n```\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```\nDETAIL: Process 3169 waits for ShareLock on transaction 155867330;

Go to `Admin Area \u003e Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e Package file size limits`  \n2. Set the `Maximum NPM package file size in bytes` to 10  \n3. Save default size limits\n\nLog in as a regular user and follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new project `npm-package-test` and initialize it with a README  \n2. Create a deploy token for `npm-package-test` (`Settings \u003e Repository \u003e Deploy Tokens`)\n\n    ![Screenshot_2021-01-05_at_17.35.47.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/a413c0c7-1986-4957-924c-9cfceabad3a5/Screenshot_2021-01-05_at_17.35.47.png)\n\n3. Generate arbitrary data over 10 bytes:\n\n    ```bash  \n    $ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=1 2\u003e/dev/null | base64  \n    ```\n\n4. Make a request to create an NPM package. Specify the authentication data from item 2 in the `Authorization` header and use the data from item 3 as `\u003crandom_data\u003e`. Note that we are passing `1` in the `length` parameter, which will then be taken as the file size to validation.\n\n    ```http  \n    PUT

It seems this shouldn't be allowed in general, and also seems different from our treatment of the [API endpoint to list all users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#list-users) specifically.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAnonymous users should not be able to get user information by ID.\n\nNote: This proposal is only feasible if there is no frontend dependency (like there is with `username` lookup).\n\nSince same attack is applicable for `/api/v4/users/:id/followers` and `/api/v4/users/:id/following` we should require authentication for those endpoints too.\n\n## Out of scope\n\nThe [API endpoint to \"lookup users by username\"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#for-normal-users) should not be changed, because the frontend relies on this endpoint for anonymous users, and this endpoint is not as vulnerable to enumeration.\n\n## Related links\n\n- This problem was noticed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288853.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-13T02:21:30.816Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T16:31:39.614Z","closed_at":"2021-09-30T18:38:05.304Z","closed_by":{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle Gill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554599/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_gill"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Category:User Management","Epic 6340","FY22::Q3","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::4","section::dev","security","severity::4","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"}],"author":{"id":5616676,"username":"rchan-gitlab","name":"Ron Chan","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5616676/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchan-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"user_notes_count":57,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297473","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297473","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297473/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297473/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297473","relative":"#297473","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297473"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77129377,"iid":297472,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Secondaries are orphaning artifact files","description":"## Problem\n\nSince the [release of parallel delete of job artifacts in 13.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46971) any artifacts which are deleted in this manner (nearly all of them) become orphaned on Geo secondaries.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf fixing this before Job artifacts are migrated to the Geo framework:\n\n- Add bulk insertion of `Geo::JobArtifactDeletedEvent` records during https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.7.3-ee/ee/app/services/ee/ci/destroy_expired_job_artifacts_service.rb#L11.\n- Add bulk insertion of `Geo::JobArtifactDeletedEvent` records during https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.7.3-ee/app/services/ci/destroy_pipeline_service.rb\n\nIf fixing this during https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3114 then don't use `Geo::JobArtifactDeletedEvent`.
