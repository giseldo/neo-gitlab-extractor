We are using the Junit XML test reporting on our pipeline to show the test results within Gitlab. With our current set up these generate stacktraces on errors, that show up when clicking on the test suite to see the individual test results.\n\nWe have a reasonable amount of tests, hundreds, so the list scrolls. However, there is some javascript around the scrollable window that does not work properly, so we cannot properly read the tests. \n\nAs on GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.7.6-ee\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun a pipeline with a large amount of tests, that also has some errors.\nupon completion, check the pipeline page, go to tests, and click on the test suite.\nTry to scroll through this list of individual test results.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/ethan.reesor/contrib/gitlab-272274/pipelines/142035286/test_report\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nscrolling through the list of individual test results, the scrolling jumps unexpectedly over some parts of the scroll area. \n\n![Screen_Recording_2020-02-21_at_9.46.32_AM](/uploads/b5f68bb6462de0d3cedad7e2314d5275/Screen_Recording_2020-02-21_at_9.46.32_AM.mov)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI can neatly scroll through the test results list, reading each test result with all info that goes with it.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nTo be exactly clear, this is the feature: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html\n\n### Output of checks\n\nAs on GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.7.6-ee\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nI have no access to this.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\nI have no access to this.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThis janky/jumpy/buggy scrolling seems to happen because some javascript tries to minimize the number of test results in the DOM. When I see the scroll becoming janky, I see removal/change of DOM content in firefox devtools.\n\nThis code might have some assumption on how many pixels of height each test result has, which is wrong for test results with long names and/or error results such as stack traces?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-24T08:23:47.463Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T22:47:32.346Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T19:42:47.271Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott

On import, all the MRs that were merged in the old project became open (and assigned to me \\o/) in the created project.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Create a project\n* Create an MR in project\n* Merge MR\n* Export project\n* Import project\n* Observe MR state in imported project\n\n(I haven't actually tried to replicate this, but I imagine that's sufficient).\n\n### Example Project\n\n- Original project: https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino/gitlab-jenkinsfile-runner\n- Imported project: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/sandbox/jfr-container-builder/-/merge_requests\n\nAs a cleanup, I closed all the merge requests in the new one, but they were open, I promise.\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMRs transition from merged to open\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMRs should retain their merged state\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible

This means that the Note model has a method `remote_attachment_url=` which can be used to perform this action.\n\nAs this attribute isn't removed by the `AttributeCleaner` on project import, it can be set in the `project.json` for a note and will be set when the note is created, downloading the file:\n\nhttps://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/mounter.rb#L72  \n```ruby  \n  def remote_urls=(urls)  \n      return if not urls or urls == \"\" or urls.all?(\u0026:blank?)\n\n      [@]remote_urls = urls  \n      [@]download_error = nil  \n      [@]integrity_error = nil\n\n      [@]uploaders = urls.zip(remote_request_headers || []).map do |url, header|  \n        uploader = blank_uploader  \n        uploader.download!(url, header || {})  \n        uploader  \n      end  \n```\n\nhttps://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/uploader/download.rb#L43  \n```ruby  \n    def file  \n          if [@]file.blank?  \n            headers = [@]remote_headers.  \n              reverse_merge('User-Agent' =\u003e \"CarrierWave/#{CarrierWave::VERSION}\")\n\n            [@]file = Kernel.open([@]uri.to_s, headers)  \n            [@]file = [@]file.is_a?(String) ? StringIO.new([@]file) : [@]file  \n          end  \n```\n\nThe downloaded file is then attached to the note and can be viewed from the newly imported project.\n\nAny model that has a `mount_uploader` and is importable is potentially vulnerable to the same attack, although the majority of the others are `AvatarUploader` which checks the file type and prevents the response from being viewed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a new project  \n1. Create an issue in the project  \n1. Add a note to the issue  \n1. Export the project  \n1. Extract the export  \n1. Add  `remote_attachment_url` to the `note` hash with a url  \n1. Recompress the export and import it  \n1. View the note on the issue\n\nDemo ![ssrf-note.mp4](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/34bf7472-5f8a-4554-956e-928c0d293745/ssrf-note.mp4)\n\n### Examples\n\nExample of project import on gitlab.com hitting postbin:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/wbowling/ssrf1/-/issues/1#note_309127303  \n![Screen_Shot_2020-03-22_at_11.22.06_pm.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/6e5e0ecd-efea-4d25-9a11-eaaaf7f632cd/Screen_Shot_2020-03-22_at_11.22.06_pm.png)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nWhen importing a model that has a mount_uploader it's possible to use the carrierwave uploader seed attributes to download a file from any host: https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/wiki/How-to:-Upload-remote-image-urls-to-your-seedfile\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nThe attributes should be prohibited and removed via the `AttributeCleaner`\n\n### Output of checks  \nThis bug happens on gitlab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info  \n```  \nSystem information  \nSystem:\t\tUbuntu 18.04  \nProxy:\t\tno  \nCurrent User:\tgit  \nUsing RVM:\tno  \nRuby Version:\t2.6.5p114  \nGem Version:\t2.7.10  \nBundler Version:1.17.3  \nRake Version:\t12.3.3  \nRedis Version:\t5.0.7  \nGit Version:\t2.24.1  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.7  \nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:\t12.8.7-ee  \nRevision:\t2643fd87200  \nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails  \nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL  \nDB Version:\t10.12  \nURL:\t\thttp://gitlab-vm.local  \nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://gitlab-vm.local/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@gitlab-vm.local:some-group/some-project.git  \nElasticsearch:\tno  \nGeo:\t\tno  \nUsing LDAP:\tno  \nUsing Omniauth:\tyes  \nOmniauth Providers:\n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:\t11.0.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell  \nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git  \n```\n\n## Impact\n\n* Allows an attacker to access internal services, for example the Omnibus GitLab has all of the exporters, Prometheus, Alertmanager exposed on localhost.   \n* If GitLab is hosted on AWS it allows for the instance metadata to be accessed.  \n* Redis is running locally or accessible via tcp (address could be found by looking at the targets in Prometheus at http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets) it could be possible to obtain RCE (similar to https://github.com/jas502n/gitlab-SSRF-redis-RCE#poc). A POST request is not possible here, but as `remote_attachment_request_header=` is also available (https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/mount.rb#L169) and not blacklisted, the payload could be set via a header.  \n* If GitLab is hosted on Google Cloud, the above could be used to set the `Metadata-Flavor: Google` header and access `http://metadata.google.internal/`\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

(Validation failed: Name has already been taken)","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWith the introduction of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/17004, GitLab instances are throwing \n`ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid (Validation failed: Name has already been taken)` when the `cronjob:import_software_licenses` is ran.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Install GitLab 12.8.7 \n2. Run the import_software_licenses job\n\n```bash\nSoftwareLicense.count\nSoftwareLicense.last\n\nw = ImportSoftwareLicensesWorker.new()\n\nbegin\nw.perform\nrescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid =\u003e invalid\npp invalid.record\nend\n```\n3. Get error\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen the `cronjob:import_software_licenses` runs the import initially fails on:\n\n```bash\n#\u003cSoftwareLicense:0x00007f733186cd78\n id: nil,\n name: \"GNU General Public License v1.0 only\",\n spdx_identifier: \"GPL-1.0-only\"\u003e\n=\u003e #\u003cSoftwareLicense id: nil, name: \"GNU General Public License v1.0 only\", spdx_identifier: \"GPL-1.0-only\"\u003e\n```\n\nHowever, you can manually run the job and the import will fail on different license names. We think this is due to having a unique name field at `\"index_software_licenses_on_unique_name\" UNIQUE, btree (name)`\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2cb9a85d2beadd51b926eaddb05005403bee0013/db/schema.rb#L4081\n\nAnd looking at the [SPDX database](https://spdx.org/licenses/licenses.json), many of the licenses do not have unique names. i.e. `GNU General Public License v1.0 only`\n\nCheck a count of these names with:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://spdx.org/licenses/licenses.json | grep -c \"GNU General Public License v1.0 only\"\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nLicenses are able to import without issue.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```json\n{\"severity\":\"WARN\",\"time\":\"2020-03-18T12:57:01.704Z\",\"error_class\":\"ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid\",\"error_message\":\"Validation failed: Name has already been

No other user with other roles should be able access the group via navigation or a direct link. Ensure that user with roles other than Owner or Auditor are still able to access the group when signed with with SSO. \n\nWe should ideally have an end-to-end test to check if the Owner (and Auditor) can by-pass SSO.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

This was fixed in 12.9\n\n### Result\nTeams can add metrics to usage ping without the breaking the entire payload.\n\n### Proposal V1\nPropose the MVC required to ensure usage ping does not break due to uncaught errors.\n\nPer @jeromezng 's comment [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/telemetry/-/issues/335#note_307573839):\n\n\u003e Isolation will ensure robustness while parallelization ensures speed. Currently robustness is more important than speed (GitLab.com usage ping takes about 11 hours to run and with query optimizations this is reduced to \\~6 hours).\n\u003e \n\u003e MVC for robustness:\n\u003e \n\u003e * Have a defined list of usage pings in usage_data.rb or a yaml file\n\u003e * Cron job cycles through this entire list sequentially\n\u003e * Each job calls a get_counter(attributes, etc) method, which can fail individually.\n\u003e * Each get_counter method saves counter result to database\n\u003e * Each get_counter method sends an atomic payload to Versions OR we wait for all get_counter methods to finish then query the database to build and send a single large payload to Versions.\n\u003e * We can optionally parallelize by breaking this into three jobs: usage_activity_by_stage, usage_activity_by_stage_monthly, other counters\n\u003e \n\u003e Other ideas we discussed:\n\u003e \n\u003e * The idea about having a \"Defined list of usage pings\" in a separate database isn't a great option as it introduces state which needs to be configured. I'd rather have counters be stateless and defined in source control.\n\u003e * The idea to be able to set_counters via chatops is something we can explore in the future, but also requires configuration with varying states.\n\n### Proposal V2\n\n**12.10:** Consolidate all counters into four main counters with fail safes. Create an example of `add_usage_data` method.\n* Consolidate all counters into four main counters. We've already added \\~90% to these: Batch Count and Distant Count.\n* The four main counters will be: Batch Count, Distinct Count, Redis Count, Alternative Count.\n* Convert non-batch counters to batch counters: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208923\n* Redis Counters: this includes anything that uses redis, this however may be a \"russian doll\" where usage pings calculations are temporarily stored in Redis / multiple usage pings. We will need to spend time tracing this.\n* Alternative Counter: this includes anything miscellanous such as https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage_data.rb#L26\n* The four main counters will have their own `rescue` fail safe.

So any maintainer can create \"pull\" mirror with initial mirror user:  \n```  \n  # safe_mirror_params.rb\n\n  def valid_mirror_user?(mirror_params)  \n    return true unless mirror_params[:mirror_user_id].present?\n\n    default_mirror_users.map(\u0026:id).include?(mirror_params[:mirror_user_id].to_i)  \n  end\n\n  def default_mirror_users  \n    # mirror is removed, but \"project.mirror_user\" is still presented here  \n    [current_user, project.mirror_user].compact.uniq   \n  end  \n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Login as the user with \"maintainer\" role (let's call this user \"permanent maintainer\").  \n2. Create any \"pull\" mirror for the project.  \n3. Remove created mirror.  \n4. Login as the other user with \"maintainer\" role (let's call this user \"temporary maintainer\").  \n5. Open \"Mirroring repositories\" section in the project settings. \"Temporary maintainer\" can create a new \"pull\" mirror, but with \"permanent maintainer\" as the mirror user. So the below rule is not enforced:\n\n\u003e This user will be the author of all events in the activity feed that are the result of an update, like new branches being created or new commits being pushed to existing branches. **Upon creation or when reassigning you can only assign yourself to be the mirror user.**\n\n### Impact\n\nThis feature can be used as the backdoor. \"Temporary maintainer\" can add controlled repository there, so even if \"temporary maintainer\" will be removed from the project, he still can push the commits to a repository with maintainer privileges (because the mirror user is \"permanent maintainer\"). \n\nAny who use \"pull\" repository mirror feature is vulnerable by this. And of course this guys, because there might at least few cases when someone might need to create \"pull\" repository mirror in gitlab some time before:  \n1. Want to test it before move from some other project hosting.  \n2. Started by using only gitlab CI (in which case this might be necessary to create \"pull\" mirror in gitlab project; see [\"Benefits\" section here](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/github/)) and now moved to gitlab  \n3. It was just some dev/business requirement.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\"project.mirror_user\" relationship is presented even if the project repository mirror is removed. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIf the mirror removed, then \"project.mirror_user\" relationship also should be removed, so no one can create \"pull\" mirror with \"project.mirror_user\" as the mirror user, so this rule can be enforced:\n\n\u003e Upon creation or when reassigning you can only assign yourself to be the mirror user.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis feature can be used as the backdoor. \"Temporary maintainer\" can add a controlled repository there, so even if \"temporary maintainer\" will be removed from the project, he still can push the commits to a repository with maintainer privileges (because the mirror user can be set to \"permanent maintainer\").","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-20T12:53:34.079Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T08:15:52.839Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T08:31:35.445Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-06-19","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211940","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211940","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211940/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211940/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211940","relative":"#211940","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211940"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":32224191,"iid":211931,"project_id":278964,"title":"Version Control for Snippets: Reuse existing default file name if the file name is blank","description":"If the user created a snippet without a file name, we will assign a name to the blob file like `snippetfile1.txt`.

validation to Full API scans","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIn full scans on a non-API website, users can elect to use domain validation to create a level of safety that the correct website is being scanned. This is achieved through the use of the `DAST_FULL_SCAN_DOMAIN_VALIDATION_REQUIRED` environment variable.\n\nThis is valuable for the same reasons for a full scan of an API.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\n`DAST_FULL_SCAN_DOMAIN_VALIDATION_REQUIRED` should apply to API scans as well, and behave exactly the same way as it does for full scans of a normal website.\n\n#### Implementation plan\n\n##### Context\n\nRight now, target processing looks like this:\n\n1. Check target is valid (including domain validation). Will continue with both valid _and_ invalid targets unless domain validation fails\n1. Start ZAP\n1. Load API specification\n1. Check ZAP can access target. Exits for invalid targets\n\nIn order to implement domain validation for API scans, we'll need to move step 1 into step 4 so we can have access to the API target.\n\n##### Details\n\n1. Remove check that target is configured from `ScanScriptWrapper`. This is already checked in `ConfigurationParser`\n1. Move check that target is a valid URL from `ScanScriptWrapper` to `TargetSelector`\n1. Move DAST target probe _with domain validation_ from `ScanScriptWrapper` and `TargetWebsite` to `TargetSelector`\n    1. **Note:** the ZAP probe is a duplicate of the DAST probe, and will be removed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/257963 \n1. Enable domain validation for API full scans\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation should be updated to communicate that this feature is now supported.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability?

This will only require changes to `worker-entry` and/or `ci` script.\n\nThe format of `_EXLUDE_PATHS` will be:\n\n - Use `;` to separate entries\n - Provide only the path element, no query string scheme, or host.\n - Use `?` for single character wildcard\n - Use `*` for multiple character wildcard\n\nExamples:\n\n - `/storage/*`\n - `/v?/*`\n\nTasks:\n\n1. [x] Add a new variable `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PATHS` and `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PATHS` that uses the same rules as the `route` include/exclude logic already available via API Security configuration files.

Level Reordering Issues","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nOur REST API currently supports re-ordering issues within a project. This makes all the group users that want to re-order issues across many projects via public APIs very sad. \n\n## Proposal\n\nProvide a public API for re-ordering issues globally across all subgroups and projects.\n\n## Context\n\nRelevant code here is in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/e0d317ca8d7ba39e92fc7f89387055be087e0bae/app/services/issues/update_service.rb#L157:\n\n```ruby\nissue =\n  if board_group_id\n    IssuesFinder.new(current_user, group_id: board_group_id, include_subgroups: true).find_by(id: id)\n  else\n    project.issues.find(id)\n  end\n```\n\nWe actually already accept global issue IDs in the API (not `iids`). The problem is that when we query, we scope it to the project if a `group_id` is not provided.\n\nWhen ordering issues in an issue board, we [pass in a `group_id` to the update service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4a85e263b4afe2e1e64dcaf55856add6e7aed764/app/services/issues/reorder_service.rb#L34). We could do the same if we create a group-level reorder issues API endpoint.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nChange project issue reordering API so that it accepts issues from another group.\n\n\u003e We already accept an issue ID (not IID) for `move_before_id` and `move_after_id` in this API so the only thing that would change would be how we find the issue and our validations. We just need to validate that the before / after issues are part of the same scope for ordering.\n\n\u003e Note that there's a tricky bug here similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13254. We use `Issue#parent_ids` for determining ordering scope and right now we scope it to the project's parent group when a group board is present. But this is not taking into account that there may be ancestor group boards that may also contain this issue.\n\n\u003e So I'm not sure if we should limit this to parent group issues, or allow all group hierarchy issues and maybe just fix this other bug too.\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] Public API for global issue re-order across all subgroups and projects within a given top level group. \n- [ ] Expose `relative_position` attribute in the issue JSON API responses (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21297#note_372766565)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-19T20:17:52.186Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T03:07:58.203Z","closed_at":"2022-02-08T03:07:58.181Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","backend","boards","customer","devops::plan","group::project management","issue list","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"}],"author":{"id":1140487,"username":"toejough","name":"Joe Harman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/02d5d75e3d256d84282f82ba017666bd?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toejough"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211864","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211864","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211864/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211864/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211864","relative":"#211864","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211864"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32202000,"iid":211863,"project_id":278964,"title":"Scala is not detected by dependency scanning when dind is disabled","description":"### Summary\n\nDependency Scanning does not detect scala projects when DS_DISABLE_DIND is set to true.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. add .gitlab-ci.yml to scala project\n2. enable dependency scanning enabled\n3.

gitlab.com/my_cool_group/-/group_members\n\n4 - Start typing in \"Search for a user\" field at the top.\n\n5 - There are millions of gitlab.com users in the drop down list which cannot be added due to SAML enforcement, so why show them?\n\nThis is a UX problem.\n\n![image](/uploads/bac591c30fc2e610c7ef7dba67a56cd7/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nRestrict user autocompletes (project and sub-group members) to users who are SAML linked to the my_cool_group group.\n\nThis filter only applies when enforce SAML is enabled at top-level group. e.g. if I created gitlab.com/my_cool_group/my_sub_group, then my_sub_group should also inherit the SAML enforcement and should also adhere to filter.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation on the SAML enforcement area.\n\n### Testing\n\nTest coverage should ensure that when SAML enforcement is disabled - the dropdownlist returns back to the million of users to add.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDropdownlist shows the user just the applicable SAML'ed group members.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nSilver/Gold.\n\n### Links /

tab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#viewing-junit-test-reports-on-gitlab). Before enabling this feature by default and building the JUnit errors + screenshots feature the ~performance issues need to be resolved.\n\nRight now on loading the test report tab, all JUnit test report XML files are parsed and returned to the ~frontend this causes the page to load slow initially. It's unlikely someone would want to consume all of the fine-grain test report data at once.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\nSee the writeup in the [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2854).\n\n### Proposal\n\nAfter the [companion issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211838) to this is complete the summarized reports will be available from the database. If we implement an endpoint that parses and individual test report, we can call that instead when a specific test suite is clicked into. This should increase the performance overall as it's unlikely someone will click into every test suite.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant FE as Frontend\n    participant BE as Backend\n    U-\u003e\u003eFE: Click onto pipeline page\n    FE-\u003e\u003eBE: Request test report summaries (async)\n    BE-\u003e\u003eFE: Return test report summaries from DB\n    FE-\u003e\u003eU: Render badge counter on test tab\n    U-\u003e\u003eFE: Click Test Tab\n    FE-\u003e\u003eU: Render test tab from summary data (No visual change from current)\n    U-\u003e\u003eFE: Click on single test suite\n    FE-\u003e\u003eBE: Request full report for single test suite\n    BE-\u003e\u003eFE: Parse XML report and return detailed report\n    FE-\u003e\u003eU: Render report for single test suite\n```\nThis issue is for tracking the work necessary for completing \"Request full report for single test suite\" and \"Render report for single test suite\" from the above diagram. \n\n\nThe frontend will consume the endpoint created from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218723 in order to accomplish this.\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\nWe should read through the documentation for this feature and remove any warnings that it might be slow on the tests tab once the performance has been validated. We should then perhaps add a warning that clicking into an individual test suite might be slow instead.\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nTesting needed:\n- Unit tests will need to be made for the endpoint and service level changes.\n- package-and-qa not necessary for this test. May be addressed in future E2E test\n\nRisks:\n- User flow\n  - If Users can click in and out of individual test suites somewhat rapidly\n    - Are we able to stop parsing if a user exits the view before it is complete?\n    - Will we be running multiple instances of parsing at the same time if a user quickly clicks through? Performance issue?\n  - Users will need appropriate messaging including\n    - While parsing\n    - No record situation\n    - Failures to parse\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIf after clicking on the test tab on a main `gitlab` project pipeline the page loads in less than 1000ms this will be a large success.\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Before enabling this feature by default and building the JUnit errors + screenshots feature the ~performance issues need to be resolved.\n\nRight now when the test tab is clicked on, and in order to generate the badge counter we need to parse the junit report files for all tests builds that generated junit reports. This takes a lot of time (50+ seconds to generate the badge counter the first time).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\nSee the writeup in the [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2854).\n\n### Proposal\n\nLimit the amount of data being processed on page load but give users a way to fetch the full data set if they want by:\n\n* Using the [established pattern](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25199#note_314192294) of storing summarized results in a `jsonb` column per build\n* The parsing of the JUnit XML report from the pipeline should be done in the background, and the results summarized in the `ci_build_report_results` table in a `jsonb` column.\n* Use a query to summarize the results per build into the counter on the tests tab, as well as the top column as indicated in this MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25199 (basically I think that we should finish implementing this MR with a small tweak), i.e. we should probably _calculate_ the counter and the test summary at the top, and not store them separately.\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\nClick here to see our current JSON schema proposal.\n\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```\n{\n  \"total_time\": 0,\n  \"total_count\": 0,\n  \"success_count\": 0,\n  \"failed_count\": 2,\n  \"errored_count\": 0,\n  \"skipped_count\": 0,\n  \"test_suite_results\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"job 0\",\n      \"duration\": 0,\n      \"success\": 0,\n      \"failed\": 1,\n      \"errored\": 0,\n      \"skipped\": 0,\n      \"total\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"job 1\",\n      \"duration\": 0,\n      \"success\": 0,\n      \"failed\": 1,\n      \"errored\": 0,\n      \"skipped\": 0,\n      \"total\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nDoing this (in the background?) should drastically reduce the load time of the badge on the pipeline page, and the initial load of the test tab. On clicking into a specific test group on the test tab the load time would still be fairly high as we would have to parse the junit.xml file then in order to give the granular results. Improving performance for individual junit report report loading will be handled in another issue after when [another issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218723) is completed.\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis will add one row per build that uploads a junit artifact in an append-only fashion (As indicated here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25199#note_326136891). We should eventually clean up these rows as they do not need to be kept around forever, and indeed can be regenerated as long as the junit artifacts exist. We also are not currently using them for reporting so we could figure out a summarization strategy for them at such time as we need to use them for reporting.\n\n#### Testing required\n\n* Unit test changes/additions\n  * For new calculations for test badge\n    * CRUD on DB jsonb storage of summary info\n    * FE calculations of badge data\n    * Possible revisit of end user status indicator for window between end of pipeline and test data being available\n* End-to-end test\n  * Not required for this iteration as it is core, but will be covereed in future test\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

the Feature Request template.\n\n* For issues related to features of the docs.gitlab.com site, see\n     https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/issues/\n\n* For information about documentation content and process, see\n     https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/ --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe [Contributor and Development docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/README.html#other-development-guides) are missing guidance on how to get the Web Terminal setup and running, which can be a little complicated.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should add a section that pulls together all relevant information on how to do this in these docs under a \"Setting up the Web Terminal locally\" section.\n\nThe change / new page could be structured as follows:\n\n- New page for Setting up Web Terminal locally\n\t- GDK \n\t\t- host file instructions\n\t- Minikube\n\t\t- installation\n\t\t- role \u0026 role-binding assignment\n\t\t- obtaining secret token\n\t- Gitlab Runner\n\t\t- installation\n\t\t- registering a new runner\n\t\t- `config.toml` customisation\n\t\t- running the runner\n\t- Troubleshooting\n\t\t- Infinite loading icon (likely pipeline concurrency)\n\t\t- Bad handshake (likely token / config / role setup issue)\n\n### Who can address the issue\n\n@vhawoldar or @a_luna can address this issue having spent some time getting familiar with the process.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-19T09:19:08.013Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T22:49:43.593Z","closed_at":"2020-04-17T22:49:43.546Z","closed_by":{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo

setting to automate deactivation of dormant users","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUser management is a time consuming effort by admins (self-managed). The effort is exasperated due to our lack of readily available in-app user management tools.\n\nFor example, when an instance has hundreds of users, there is no easy way to identify which users are actively utilizing the system and which have gone dormant.\n\nWe provide some useful data in our API but the effort to identify which users are dormant and subsequently deactivate them is still time consuming. We aren't making it easy to love using GitLab for user management.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n1. We should offer an admin setting for admin users to toggle on the ability to automate deactivation or blocking of dormant users after 90 days of inactivity.\n1. This setting should default to disabled since there is significant potential impact to a user's instance.\n1. In summary: After 90 days of user inactivity, where the setting is enabled, we should automatically [deactivate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/activating_deactivating_users.html#deactivating-a-user) the user. \n     1. By placing the user in a deactivated state, the user will not be counted as an active user in the instance. However, it does not prohibit the user from logging back in via the UI. Once a deactivated user logs back into the GitLab UI, their account is set to active again. \n\n\n### Future Iterations\n\n1. The admin should be able to choose whether the users meeting the inactivity criteria should be blocked or deactivated.\n1. Give the admin the flexibility to dictate the threshold for inactivity while ensuring a minimum of 90 days.\n\n### Designs\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/282537/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-19T00:17:55.328Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T13:10:32.645Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T02:55:43.969Z","closed_by":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"labels":["Engineering","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","link::parent issue","missed:13.10","missed:13.11","section::fulfillment","self-managed","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"}],"author":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":35,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211754","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211754","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211754/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211754/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211754","relative":"#211754","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211754"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5519,"epic":{"id":217169,"iid":5519,"title":"[Self-managed] Deactivation of dormant users","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5519","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32155306,"iid":211721,"project_id":278964,"title":"Permission Documentation Table Should Include Manage:Analytics Features","description":"To like to clarify expectations for what various users--especially guests--can see in various analytics features, we should include them in the table on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html.

Not sure if the number of branches is reasonable and typical, but it's probably worth investigation.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Check out the [Performance Tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance)\n1. Run the specific test with the `run-k6` command. For example against the 50k environment you would run this following from the project root: `./run-k6 -e environments/50k.json -o 60s_1000rps.json -t web_project_branches.js`. You will need an ACCESS_TOKEN for this endpoint as well.\n1. If you're seeking to run the test against your own environment the [Tool's documentation has details on how to achieve this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/blob/master/docs/k6.md).\n1. If you're willing to run the test against large [`monorepo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance-data/-/blob/master/projects_export/linux_export.tar.gz) - please use [`import rake task`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/import_project.html#importing-via-a-rake-task) to import the project unless https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208452 is closed.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe results above show that the Branches page has a P90 of 692.84ms. This was tested on our 50k Reference Architecture with a RPS target of 1000/s. It targeted our own [`gitlabhq`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance-data#gitlab-performance-test-framework-data) project that has 2815 branches. More detailed specs: 800 Mb Files, 1.90 Gb Trees, 6.2 Gb Blobs, 150k commits, 7k issues, 3.6 MRs, 33 labels\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAs part of the [new performance targets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels) this endpoint is currently over our TTFB target and just falls into the ~S4 tier. Task is to improve the endpoint's performance to meet our performance target (\u003c500ms).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T18:58:11.206Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T14:26:48.213Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T12:18:16.778Z","closed_by":{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","Quality:performance-issues","backend","bug::performance","customer","devops::create","frontend","frontend-weight::1","group::source code","performance-refinement","priority::4","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":4477602,"username":"niskhakova","name":"Nailia Iskhakova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477602/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/niskhakova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211710","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211710","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211710/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211710/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211710","relative":"#211710","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211710"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32147463,"iid":211707,"project_id":278964,"title":"Being both a CODEOWNER and reviewer results in MR not showing in filter list","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nLet's say that I'm a CODEOWNER for Project A.

This is very indirect and hard to maintain.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Ideally we can set up the dropzone in the component that needs it (and even move our file upload modal to Vue).\n- If this is unfeasible, then maybe we can move the dropzone setup to `repository/index.js`\n\n## Context\n\nThe following discussion from !26828 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @pslaughter started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26828#note_307191450): \n\n    \u003e **note:** The reason this was no longer being loaded is because the `#tree-slider` is not being rendered now that the `vue_file_list_enabled` is on.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/74fb4a1a226c8a68b8c76646383831945e935d5a/app/views/projects/_files.html.haml#L22\n\n## Detail update\n\nFrom discussion with @pslaughter \n\n\u003e Basically, we're trying to remove `initBlob` from `app/assets/javascripts/pages/projects/show/index.js` since only a small piece is actually needed. In particular probably just the `uploadBlobForm` piece.\n\u003e \n\u003e
