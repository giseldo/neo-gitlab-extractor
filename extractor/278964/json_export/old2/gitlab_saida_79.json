The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\nThe `/iteration` quick action now accepts the iteration name as an argument and has auto-completion\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nCurrently, the quick action for setting the iteration of an issue is `/iteration *iteration:\"Iteration name\"`, this is more verbose than necessary and does not have auto-completion.  It should follow the style of the other quick actions where only the name of the label, milestone, assignee, ... is required.\n\nThe current quick action style causes a lot of accidental typing mistakes.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nThe `/iteration` quick action should simply accept the iteration's name, provides auto-completion.\n\n### Acceptance\n\n- [ ] Can select an iteration from a cadence via autocomplete when using the quick action.\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-12T09:33:52.211Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T15:29:10.963Z","closed_at":"2022-12-21T06:24:50.540Z","closed_by":{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"},"labels":["GitLab Premium","Stretch","backend","customer","devops::plan","direction","documentation","frontend","group::project management","missed:15.0","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"}],"author":{"id":2939827,"username":"quazgar","name":"Quazgar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2939827/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/quazgar"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"},"user_notes_count":45,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":9,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324298","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 7 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324298","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324298/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324298/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#324298","relative":"#324298","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324298"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2422,"epic":{"id":17590,"iid":2422,"title":"Iterations In GitLab","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2422","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 29, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":{"id":85337,"iid":146,"sequence":31,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-09-28T00:05:02.209Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T00:05:05.396Z","start_date":"2022-12-21","due_date":"2023-01-03","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/85337"},"health_status":null},{"id":80776333,"iid":324295,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Add selected state for chart button in vulnerabilities dashboard\"","description":"The following discussion from !54763 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @yo started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54763#note_513748128):  (+3 comments)\n\n    \u003e I think a different approach would be to work through https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1000 to update this in GitLab UI, and then if the instances you opened the MRs for don’t use the component, migrate them to it.\n\n\n/cc @andyvolpe\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/vulnerability_chart_buttons.vue uses `GlButtons` in order to display the image below.

We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. Create a new HAML partial for the \"Enforce for all subgroups\" checkbox. Partial will be called `app/views/shared/cascading_settings/_enforcement_checkbox.html.haml` and look something like this:\n\n```haml\n- attribute = local_assigns.fetch(:attribute, nil)\n- group = local_assigns.fetch(:group, nil)\n- form = local_assigns.fetch(:form, nil)\n\n- return unless attribute \u0026\u0026 group \u0026\u0026 form \u0026\u0026 cascading_namespace_settings_enabled?\n- return if group.namespace_settings.public_send(\"#{attribute}_locked?\")\n\n- lock_attribute = \"lock_#{attribute}\"\n\n.gl-form-checkbox.custom-control.custom-checkbox\n  = form.check_box lock_attribute, checked: group.namespace_settings.public_send(lock_attribute), class: 'custom-control-input'\n  = form.label lock_attribute, class: 'custom-control-label' do\n    %span= s_('NamespaceSettings|Enforce for all subgroups')\n    %p.help-text= s_('NamespaceSettings|All subgroups will inherit this setting.')\n```\n\n1. Create a new HAML partial for the setting label and lock icon. Partial will be called `app/views/shared/cascading_settings/_setting_label.html.haml` and look something like this:\n\n```haml\n- attribute = local_assigns.fetch(:attribute, nil)\n- group = local_assigns.fetch(:group, nil)\n- form = local_assigns.fetch(:form, nil)\n- help_text = local_assigns.fetch(:help_text, nil)\n\n- return unless attribute \u0026\u0026 group \u0026\u0026 form\n\n- locked_method = \"#{attribute}_locked?\"\n\n= form.label attribute, class: 'custom-control-label', aria: { disabled: group.namespace_settings.public_send(locked_method) } do\n  %span.position-relative.gl-pr-6.gl-display-inline-flex\n    = yield\n    - if group.namespace_settings.public_send(locked_method)\n      %button.position-absolute.gl-top-3.gl-right-0.gl-translate-y-n50.gl-cursor-default.btn.btn-default.btn-sm.gl-button.btn-default-tertiary.js-cascading-setting-lock-popover-target{ class: 'gl-p-1! gl-text-gray-600! gl-bg-transparent!',\n        type: 'button',\n        data: { locked_by_namespace: { full_name: 'test', path: '/foo/bar' }.to_json } }\n        = sprite_icon('lock', size: 16)\n  - if help_text\n    %p.help-text\n      = help_text\n```\n\n1. Use those partials in `ee/app/views/groups/settings/_delayed_project_removal.html.haml`\n1. Create `app/assets/javascripts/namespaces/components/cascading_setting_lock_popover.vue` that finds all of the `.js-cascading-setting-lock-popover-target` elements and mounts a `GlPopover` component for that element.\n1. Create `app/assets/javascripts/namespaces/cascading_setting_lock_popover.js` which mounts `cascading_setting_lock_popover.vue`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-10T19:58:09.908Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T20:47:27.745Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T15:00:02.457Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"labels":["GitLab Core","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","devops::manage","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"}],"author":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":76,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324097","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324097","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324097/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324097/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#324097","relative":"#324097","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324097"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4419,"epic":{"id":113094,"iid":4419,"title":"Settings Management for Organization, Group and Project levels","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4419","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":80662475,"iid":324087,"project_id":278964,"title":"\"Prevent MR approvals by the author\" is ignored unless checked, saved, and unchecked","description":"\n### Summary\n\nIf  a new merge request approval rule it will act as though \"Prevent MR approvals by the author\" is togged on. This can be fixed by toggling it on and off.\n\nThe bug seems to be a number of the approval parameters are initialised as `null`. I think if these are set initialised correctly this should fix the bug. The parameters are shown in the API responses below!\n\nThis may relate to the discussion in #36978, and the underlying issue appears to be touched upon in the comments of #36486. But I don't think either of these explicitly describe this bug behaviour.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n**During these steps it is worth checking the `/approvals` API route**\n\n1. Create a new project with a simple README.md file\n1. Go to Settings-\u003eMerge request approvals and set a new approval rule where *you* are one of the approvers. The bug behaviour is more clear if you add more than one approver. **Do not touch the check boxes below at this point**\n1. Create a new MR. Can be anything. I created a change to the read me from the WebIDE. You will be listed in the approval rule as expected (as \"Prevent MR approvals by the author\" is off by default)\n1. Once created check the approval rule. You will not be listed as an approver any more\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/julianstirling/mr-aproval-test/-/merge_requests/1   \u003c- this is no longer in the bug state as I have done the further steps given below.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behaviour?\n\n\n#### Initial behaviour\nWhen you first create the project run the following API request:\n\n    curl --header \"Private-Token: YouCanNotHaveMyToken\" -X GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/123456789/approvals\n\nThe response is:\n\n    {\"approvers\":[],\n     \"approver_groups\":[],\n     \"approvals_before_merge\":0,\n     \"reset_approvals_on_push\":true,\n     \"disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\":null,\n     \"merge_requests_author_approval\":null,\n     \"merge_requests_disable_committers_approval\":null,\n     \"require_password_to_approve\":null\n    }\n\nThe `null`s do not seem right to me as the tick boxes have values. This might be as expected as there are no approval rules. However, once you make the approval rule this remains unchanged. As mentioned above you are not listed on the approval (but approval is implied):\n![image](/uploads/8b537f4ebcb856a401ea2c2909be1eca/image.png)\n\n#### Change behaviour\nIf you then go to settings and set \"Prevent MR approvals by the author\" to True, and save the changes. You will still not be listed on that rule as expected. UI changes slightly:  \n![image](/uploads/252bd2c185277b9ebe8e411a5c6c281f/image.png)  \nAPI:\n\n     {\"approvers\":[],\n      \"approver_groups\":[],\n      \"approvals_before_merge\":0,\n      \"reset_approvals_on_push\":true,\n      \"disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\":true,\n      \"merge_requests_author_approval\":false,\n      \"merge_requests_disable_committers_approval\":false,\n      \"require_password_to_approve\":false\n      }\n\n#### Action to fix (Workaround)\nNow return to settings and set \"Prevent MR approvals by the author\" to False, and save the changes. Everything now works as expected:  \n![image](/uploads/c460e90ac65a90c873e476ebf9e92bde/image.png)  \nAPI:\n\n    {\"approvers\":[],\n      \"approver_groups\":[],\n      \"approvals_before_merge\":0,\n      \"reset_approvals_on_push\":true,\n      \"disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\":true,\n      \"merge_requests_author_approval\":true,\n      \"merge_requests_disable_committers_approval\":false,\n      \"require_password_to_approve\":false\n      }\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behaviour?\n\nImplied by above :slight_smile: \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee API responses above\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-10T18:09:39.371Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T07:07:02.430Z","closed_at":"2021-06-03T19:06:06.719Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"labels":["Deliverable","approaching-SLO","approvals","backend","backend-weight::2","customer","devops::create","frontend","frontend-weight::1","group::code review","missed-SLO","priority::2","quad-planning::ready","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"}],"author":{"id":464728,"username":"julianstirling","name":"Julian Stirling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/464728/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/julianstirling"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":63,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324087","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324087","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324087/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324087/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/290254"},"references":{"short":"#324087","relative":"#324087","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324087"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":80661971,"iid":324086,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Remove combined_menu feature flag","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:combined_menu` feature flag ...\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Create - Editor\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_editor`\n- Best individual to reach out to: Chad Woolley\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe top navigation menu (Projects/Groups/More) will be combined into a single menu.

This will give us an opportunity to either exclude certain tests from running on that env (e.g. staging) or refactor the tests to pass with the ff on (once it is enabled globally), so we can avoid any blocked deployments down the track. It would also help if you could include a SET in any leading up MRs to do the necessary prep work (e.g. new selectors/methods).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-10T17:55:54.275Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T07:02:19.319Z","closed_at":"2021-08-02T23:26:47.069Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul

framework\" setting in the `Naming, topics, avatar` section makes it very discoverable, but this also pushes it to an even higher priority spot in the UI than e.g. the description or the avatar of the project, which does not feel right and probably also does not reflect how often the \"Compliance framework\" setting is currently being used. \n\nMy own assumption would be that \"Naming, topics, avatar\" is also not the section where users would search for setting a compliance framework, so we should consider finding (or creating) a new place for this setting.\n\n## MVC\n\nCreate a new section in Project `Settings \u003e General` `::after Badges` and move the compliance framework dropdown

This also increases the CPU time spent on the request. `Projects::PipelinesController#index` appears frequently in [the longest CPU-consuming endpoints](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/840#note_518981518)\n\n## Proposal\n\nI would like to suggest we load the artifact list lazily when the download button is clicked instead.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-03-10_at_10.06.21](/uploads/49fa0739520ee5f6fc54cb9df301314e/Screen_Shot_2021-03-10_at_10.06.21.png)\n\nFrom my personal perspective, I barely click that download button. When I do, I care about a test failure in a particular pipeline in the page. Other pipelines are out of my radar. So, I think it's reasonable to wait for a fraction of seconds when the artifacts are loading when I click on the button. I believe that other users may share the same workflow, but don't have any metrics to back this claim up.\n\nOne more point to back this up is that the artifacts will be added gradually when a test finishes. If a user accesses the page when some tests are still running, they have to reload the page to get the full list artifacts. Lazily loading the artifacts can make sure the artifact list always up-to-date, in-sync with the build status.\n\nWe already defer loading the build status to after clicking on the stage icon. So I think it's safe to replicate that behavior.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-03-10_at_13.53.28](/uploads/d553010dd23310b02a49f07f3004e640/Screen_Shot_2021-03-10_at_13.53.28.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-10T06:58:14.520Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T16:31:28.630Z","closed_at":"2021-04-29T22:27:15.019Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","backend","bug::performance","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","group::pipeline insights","group::scalability","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":7815314,"username":"qmnguyen0711","name":"Quang-Minh Nguyen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7815314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qmnguyen0711"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"user_notes_count":113,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-05-17","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324003","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324003","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324003/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/324003/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#324003","relative":"#324003","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#324003"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5652,"epic":{"id":230613,"iid":5652,"title":"Prioritize -

However, it's possible that a given package may be updated many times, and fetching the commit message can be computationally expensive. This can slow down the UI or even result in page load errors. \n\nLong-term this can be addressed by adding a GraphQL API for the Package Registry so that not all of the data displayed on the page has to come from the controller. This change is proposed here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285467.\n\nHowever, this issue will focus on removing the commit message which will be faster than the requisite backend changes. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove the commit message data from the package details page until such time as we can address https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285467.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-09T23:00:58.892Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T07:08:57.850Z","closed_at":"2021-03-29T20:33:52.630Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","UX","backend","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","package:active","package:scaling","ruby","section::ops","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323981","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323981","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323981/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323981/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#323981","relative":"#323981","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#323981"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":80589290,"iid":323966,"project_id":278964,"title":"Expose DORA 4 data through GraphQL","description":"### Background\n\nWe've recently added API support for two DORA 4 metrics: deployment frequency and lead time: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dora/metrics.html\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing?

Only when it has been hovered on for the entire duration of the loading period should it unfurl.\n- [ ] If an item is hovered upon and begins loading, it should stop loading if hovering stops before the item unfurls.\n- [ ] Collapsed items should not unfurl immediately on hover even if they have already been fetched/expanded/loaded. Hovering should still trigger the loading state for unfurling. _Scenario_: The Dog epic in the epic tree has 8 child issues. The user has already expanded this Dog epic and that information has already been loaded. If the user closes Dog and then hovers an issue over the collapsed Dog epic to add to it, the Dog epic still shows a loading spinner and slight delay before opening.\n\n- Possible idea to pair up on with UX (@uhlexsis ) in the MR: implement a slight pause over the epic before it's automatically expanded.

In addition, we need to ensure we update references in the requirements_management_test_reports.\n\n* this might be tricky if we want to avoid outage/limited availability of requirements during migration\n* Requirement attributes is a subset of Issue attributes. `state` will be changed to `closed` instead of `archived` though\n* this conversion will probably break links to existing requirements (e.g. if a requirement URL was `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/requirements_management/requirements/112`, it would become `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/987`) - this is related to how much separated we want to have both.\n\nUPDATE: to avoid breaking changes, we could create an issue for each requirement and make sure that both are synced (so when issue is changed, also requirement is changed and vice versa). Then in a next step (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323781) we can deprecate requirement model but still keep it as a proxy to the issue.\n\nSo in the end requirements API should remain as is (for the deprecation period -

see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271171#note_521989053\n* for restricting what features are available, we could re-use the same approach implemented for test cases - see Felipe's comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297270#note_508104283\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-08T16:19:41.727Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T21:52:37.112Z","closed_at":"2021-06-17T12:47:32.760Z","closed_by":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"labels":["Category:Requirements Management","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","Next Up","backend","devops::plan","direction","group::certify","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"}],"author":{"id":4586870,"username":"mjwood","name":"Mark Wood","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4376afce32152d684a9563d594dbb257?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mjwood"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323778","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323778","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323778/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/323778/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#323778","relative":"#323778","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#323778"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5171,"epic":{"id":178701,"iid":5171,"title":"Work Items -
