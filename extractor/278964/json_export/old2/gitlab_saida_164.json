[{"id":26763054,"iid":35736,"project_id":278964,"title":"Graphql resolver complexity multiplier is never used","description":"We have a code that increases query complexity depending on number of nodes being fetched - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/graphql/resolvers/base_resolver.rb#L21. For example for these two queries:\n\n```\nquery {\n  project(fullPath: \"h5bp/html5-boilerplate\") {\n    issues(first: 1) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          title\n        }\n      }\n    \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nquery {\n  project(fullPath: \"h5bp/html5-boilerplate\") {\n    issues(first: 100) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          title\n        }\n      }   \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI would expect that complexity will be higher for the second query which fetches 100 issues. The problem is that it's same for both queries.\n\nThe problem is probably that [field_complexity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/graphql/types/base_field.rb#L34) uses `resolver_class` parameter to detect if a field uses a resolver. I think this parameter used to be passed in earlier versions of graphql-ruby, but now it seems to be always `nil`, so we should ideally use a different check for resolvers.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-06T13:27:56.572Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T15:39:09.358Z","closed_at":"2020-03-20T15:39:09.293Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["GraphQL","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","missed-SLO","missed-deliverable","missed:12.6","priority::2","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35736","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35736","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35736/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35736/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#35736","relative":"#35736","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#35736"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26762755,"iid":35735,"project_id":278964,"title":"SUCCESS Perform a planned failover using single-node Geo","description":"Recording: https://youtu.be/ll10mE0OFHM\n\n### Versions\n\nCurrent: `12.7.0-pre`\n\n### Planned failover checklist\n\n#### Preflight\n\n* [x] Create a zoom meeting and schedule a recorded meeting (make sure you have a paid account, otherwise recordings will stop after 40 minutes)\n* [x] Create GEO nodes\n* [x] Verify that the Geo primary and secondary are healthy pre failover\n\n### Failover\n\n* [x] Retrieve a beverage of choice within a drinkable temperature range\n* [x] Join Zoom meeting and wait for arrival.

In several places of the UI, we check that the user [can fork the project and also create a merge request on it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/views/projects/tree/_tree_header.html.haml#L87). \n\nNevertheless, when we access the web IDE directly, we just check for read permissions.\n\nThere is no security problem since every action is checked against the user but we should be consistent whether showing the web IDE or an error.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a public project\n- With a user who is not a member of the project, click the \"Web IDE\" button (an error message will appear)\n- With the same user, access directly the web IDE url for that project (no error will appear).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDifferent access policies used for accessing the same resource, the web IDE.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe use the same behavior for accessing the web IDE.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nInstead of spreading the access rights checkings, I would create the policy `access_web_ide` or `read_web_ide` and there I would add all the necessary access rights needed to access the web IDE.\n\nThen we would have to replace the existing checks and use that one.

If the user is already being counted as \"using a license\" because they're part of another group or project within the instance, it shouldn't trigger the modal.\n1. The subscription usage widget should show up on the admin users page and members page for all groups and subgroups. The subscription widget should still be titled with the name/plan of the instance to which the subscription is applied.\n1. If the instance is on a free plan with no subscription, that subscription usage component shouldn't show up at all.\n1. The `Maximum users` and `Licenses owed` numbers in the UI should increment immediately after a user is added that would increase those values.\n1.

This information is readily accessible using `git`s native `rev-list` command, which is a core part of the git toolkit. However, when interacting with a repo via the GitLab API, this functionality is no longer available.\n\nCurrently, the only way to access this data is the old-fashioned way -- clone the repo locally, run `git rev-list` from the command line, and get the output. --\u003e\n\nSome systems have a need to be able to retrieve the ancestry of a commit to be able to associate it with other assets and resources. Moreover, they may need to specify the order of the parent commits returned. An example provided by a customer is that they wish to mimic Git's native `rev-list` command with support for the `--topo-order` flag.\n\nIt is currently possible to retrieve the ancestry of a commit with `GET /projects/:id/repository/commits`. But it is not possible to specify any order other than the default timestamp order.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nThis feature is an addition to the API, and therefore intended for software developers who are integrating GitLab with other systems.\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nNote that this issue originally proposed a new API endpoint for rev-list and has been rewritten to focus on an MVC adding an `order` param to an existing endpoint.\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- **Example use case:**\n\nUser has a series of commits, some of which have associated build artifacts in their build system. The user wants to associate which build artifacts are ancestors of which. To do this, they would like to get a list of the ancestry of a given commit, so they can associate previous builds via their SHAs. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWe will extend [the List Repository Commits endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#list-repository-commits) to include a new `order` param feature that will support the ordering functionality of [rev-list](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-list).\n\nWe would like to start with an MVC to support `order=topo`, which mimics the behavior of the `--topo-order` flag in the `git rev-list` command.\n\nIf no `order` param is provided or an invalid value is passed, we will continue to default to reverse chronological order.\n\n**Update** The implementation is using `git log --topo-order` on the Gitaly side as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35671#note_280046100\n\n\u003c!--\n```\nGET /projects/:id/repository/commits/:sha/rev-list\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| `id` | integer/string | yes | The ID or URL-encoded path of the project owned by the authenticated user |\n| `sha` | string | yes | The commit hash |\n| `topo-order` | boolean | false | Display results in topographic (instead of chronological) order |\n| `before` | datetime | false | Display commits only older than a specific date |\n| `after` | datetime | false | Display commits more recent than a specific date |\n\nExample request:\n\n```\ncurl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cyour_access_token\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/5/repository/commits/5937ac0a7beb003549fc5fd26fc247adbce4a52e/rev-list?topo-order=true\u0026before=2019-10-01\u0026after=2019-01-01\"\n```\n\nResponds with\n\n```json\n[\n  \"1a0b6012f5b77f6abff8c4f5fbe56f0fa2300ab0\",\n  \"5a0ebc032c4b7669e1807ab25afb3af29590944a\",\n  \"039c9d4d665d04aaf30238fb56f1ff752bb1b8a3\",\n  \"31c733c1f5c2e224bc7755c1a261713b868ba5ff\",\n  \"b9642a55bccf6d39bc438ee68690af3843fd4cbd\",\n  \"021023a4ad95ff168bff4118c9b1e580d7c16e8a\",\n  \"ef94ae5a6f975eba0db1ac6d8641fc5163c363ad\",\n  \"5c441a7c73f944fefc91e64614ba99135342185c\",\n  \"4d5feeba9f8e42005968b2b9a5a0752e99232d29\"\n]\n```\n--\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nThis new functionality should be documented on the [Commits API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html) resource page, including a list of attributes and an example response.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

build\n  - test\ngenerate-config:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - generate_yaml --service=A \u003e config-a.yml\n    - generate_yaml --service=B \u003e config-b.yml\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - config-a.yml\n      - config-b.yml\n\nservice-a:\n  stage: test\n  trigger:\n    include:\n      - artifact: config-a.yml\n        job: generate-config\n\nservice-b:\n  stage: test\n  trigger:\n    include:\n      - artifact: config-b.yml\n        job: generate-config\n```\n\n1. define `trigger:include:artifact` config entry and validations\n1. enable server-side artifact download when `trigger:include:artifact` is used\n1. allow creation of child pipeline to evaluate `trigger:include:artifact` by consequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Future improvements\n\n- One possibility is that if the `job` keyword is not provided, it will search through all artifacts available to the job and use the first matching file.\n- Use a `bootstrap` job that where all trigger jobs can download artifacts from\n\n```yaml\nbootstrap:\n  script:\n    - generate_yaml \u003emy_1.yml\n    - generate_yaml \u003emy_2.yml\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - my_1.yml\n      - my_2.yml\n\nuse_yaml_trigger_1:\n  trigger:\n    include:\n      - artifact: my_1.yml # defaults to taking artifact from bootstrap job, as bootstrap is specified implicitly as `job: bootstrap`\n\nuse_yaml_trigger_2:\n  trigger:\n    include:\n      - artifact: my_2.yml\n        job: bootstrap # optional since the generating job is called bootstrap\n```\n\nWe default to a job called `bootstrap` if no `job:` value is provided. This would make things easier in simple use cases.\n\n### Constraints and limitations\n\nThe `artifact` keyword would not be usable on the top-level as follows, since that would result in undefined behavior (no job has run at the point the top-level `include` keyword is parsed):\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n  - artifact: my.yml\n    job: generate_yaml\n```\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nAs trigger jobs are executed server-side the `include:artifact` causes a download of the artifact on the server in order to be evaluated. We need to treat this carefully from security and performance point of view.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nAn important example in the documentation to provide for this feature should be setting up matrix builds using child pipelines.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

By default, features are available to all users in all environments.`\n  - Allow users  to choose a strategy type\n  - Allow users to adjust strategy parameters\n  - Strategy should default to `All users`\n  - Allow users to add environments to the strategy\n    - Strategy should default to `All environments`\n    - Selecting an environment should remove All environments label\n    - Allow users to search for existing environments (exclude already selected environments)\n    - Allow user to create a tag for an environment if it does not exist\n\n| Desc | Mockup |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Strategies | ![Feature_Flag_Detail](/uploads/c5b2797184c0e0aa9212191226536852/Feature_Flag_Detail.png) |\n| Default strategy | ![Feature_Flag_Detail_Default](/uploads/779bf8060f7c22b23081b86727a6cea1/Feature_Flag_Detail_Default.png) | \n| Add environment | ![Add_Environments](/uploads/552058c90a72696042b291f75f39734d/Add_Environments.png) |\n| Create environment tag | ![Add_Environments_Create](/uploads/00db3fce82af1ccb6b43241ea8be7cb9/Add_Environments_Create.png) |\n| Multiple strategies | ![image](/uploads/7e378013e9d7a963c9069df6596e8545/image.png) |\n| Empty strategy state | ![image](/uploads/d1818a7943e378df9c6be9a4278bfd45/image.png) |\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

We should return a specific error instead, at least when a user tries to add only one child epic at time. The errors returned could be:\n\n- parrent epic == child epic\n- child epic is already in the structure \n- level would be too deep after adding a child epic\n- child epic doesn't belong to group (or subgroup) of a parent epic\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/epic.rb#L324 for more context\n\nOne of the examples:\n\nAdding an Epic with depth \u003c 4 as a sub-epic of another with levels of ancestry \u003c 4 results in a 404 when total depth \u003e 5.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

In order to validate this approach, we should create a proof of concept that showcases end-to-end how this framework *may* look like. The purpose is to validate some very basic assumptions and facilitate discussion in the team regarding technical direction. This should be the *absolute minimal iteration*! It is about the concept, not about a clean implementation.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n* Geo is usually not considered by other teams when implementing features\n* Customers expect new features (and their data) to be replicated either for performance or Disaster Recovery purposes\n* Adding new data types to Geo is hard and can only be performed by the Geo team\n* Verification of data types is difficult and does not perform well. Again only the Geo team can do this\n* The company is growing rapidly and adds new features; the current operational mode is not scalable\n* Software developers across GitLab are not empowered to make their features geo-compatbile\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n* Use the existing repositories data type to validate some assumptions\n* Implement a POC interface for adding a Geo datatype\n* Implement a POC event-based system based on @dbalexandre's suggestion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12565\n* Implement a POC for verification based on https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2097\n\nThis should cover the entire data type end to end. It may not even work but it should allow to discuss the direction with the team.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n* An MR that showcases a potential future framework with a solid foundation for repositories\n* Defined next steps for the Geo framework\n* Actionable discussion in the Geo team\n\n### Links /

If we don't hear that anyone was disrupted by the change, we can remove the feature flag. If people were disrupted by the change they can toggle the feature flag to re-enable design management and we can work out what to do from there (either support them in their migration to hashed storage, or come up with a plan B).\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::knowledge\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_knowledge`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @.luke\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nNothing, as the feature flag is enabled by default. \n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThere is the potential for on-prem customers who had not previously upgraded to 12.5 when the hashed storage was required discovering they are negatively affected once this feature flag is removed.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nNo monitoring required.\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nWe won't be doing beta testing, as the feature flag has been enabled by default.\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [-] Enable on staging\n- [-] Test on staging\n- [-] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [-] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour\n- [-] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with `#production` and `#g_delivery` on slack.\n- [-] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [-] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production`\n- [-] Cross post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` and in your team channel\n- [-] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in

[Customer ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/136442) (internal) was around the fact that any pattern definition in a variable containing `.*` could not be made to work, having tried several protection strategies to define and / or use the variable  \n\n    * I might have found a further misbehaviour, which is that while `/^ab/` matches  `abcde` when applied direct, it doesn't work when matching via a variable. My further test case of `/^ab.*/` probably doesn't work because `/^ab/` doesn't.\n\n1.   (now in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36940) Jobs do get created when the regex (in a variable) contains `$` but when that variable is exported to the runner (and in the runner debug output) the `$` is missing\n\n**edit** 2019-11-21 - title changed, and content largely hidden for the issue relating to `$`, now: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36940\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe example project contains a full CI configuration;  this is a summary.\n\nThese are the test patterns and test string.\n\n```\nvariables:\n  teststring: 'abcde'\n  pattern1: '/^abcde$/'\n  pattern2: '/^abcd$/'\n  pattern3: '/^ab.*/'\n  pattern4: '/^ab/'\n  pattern5: '/^abcde.*/'\n  pattern6: '/^abcde/'\n  pattern7: '/^.*$/'\n  pattern8: '/.*/'\n```\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ethis section relates to the $ issue, which has been put in a separate issue\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nsee: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36940\n\nIn respect of `$` one of my example jobs dumps the shell environment. I forgot to enable debugging.  I found it originally using CI_COMMIT_DESCRIPTION, and this is what I captured:\n\n```\nAuthor: Ben Prescott \u003cbprescott@example.com\u003e\nDate:   Fri Oct 25 15:16:14 2019 +0100\n\n    ci: add a description\n    /^mo$/\n```\n\n```\n++ export 'CI_COMMIT_DESCRIPTION=/^mo/'\n++ CI_COMMIT_DESCRIPTION='/^mo/'\n```\n\nReverting to the example I made for this ticket, if you look at the dumped variables in the output/screenshot section below, all of the variables containing `$` have had it removed.\n\nMoving on from `$` to the pattern matching issue ..\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nDefining job the following way, using `only`, seven jobs get created. pattern2 fails as expected.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eJob definition where pattern match is applied direct\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\ndirect5:\n  stage: pmdirect\n  tags:\n    - shell\n  script:\n    - /usr/bin/true\n  only:\n    variables:\n      - $teststring =~ /^abcde.*/\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nVia variables, only three patterns work - 1, 5, and 6.

Jobs that get created when a pattern match rule works explicitly fail to get create when the pattern is stored in a variable instead.  Patterns including `.*` don't work, and this additional `/^ab/` case which I only just found, and am not sure what the general case is.\n\n1.  (now in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36940) `$` doesn't appear in the debug output and exported to the runner.  Issue was noticed investigating the other issue. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n1.  The same jobs that get created when pattern matched explicitly should get created when the patterns are in variables.\n\n1.   (now in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36940) Bearing in mind this is the only debug mechanism .. strings make it through verbatim.  It may well be the case this simply isn't possible, because `$` has a specific meaning in shell!  There might be times when customers don't expect it to be missing.  For example .. commit messages, or any other variable that could contain any valid character.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nOutput from example project.\n\n![CI screenshot showing which

I'll explore this option in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19098\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nForce convert both sides of `=~` and `!~` to Regexp.\n\nExample technical

for a project.\nObserve the \"Web IDE\" button disappears from the project page.\nTurn merge requests back on for a project.\nThe \"Web IDE\" button re-appears.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/MJPA/empty-project - has merge requests disabled and no \"Web IDE\" button.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNo \"Web IDE\" button on the project page.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nA \"Web IDE\" button on the project page.\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nGitLab version 12.4.1\n\n### More info\n\nNew behaviour introduced by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commit/8a008f80c00d62ad7f6262a969b15c4683667043#fd76fa2ce4182e2ba9c0218ddcb5176f814f1d03_84_84 as part of issue #29835\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or a change in requirements, but the Web IDE button is still there when looking at a particular file even with merge requests disabled. Example: https://gitlab.com/MJPA/empty-project/blob/master/README.md\n\n## Proposal\n\nThat means we would have to do the following things to get the Web IDE working for repositories with disabled merge requests:\n\n1. Fix `Error fetching merge requests from master` popping up as soon as the user opens the Web IDE\n1. Fix `Error loading merge requests. Please try again` popping up when the user opens the Branch / Merge request dropdown\n1. Implement the disabled \"Start new merge request\" checkbox\n\n| Default | Hover |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/ada6c9c420cb486c93fa7dbd7b64799a/image.png) |

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nIf there is a problem in the pipeline that deploys, it would be nice if the pipeline would perform an automatic rollback.\n\n\nFor this iteration (and this specific issue):arrow_up_down: \n\n1. Any critical alert on the environment will initiate a rollback.\n1. The user must opt-in to this feature (setting defined below in acceptance criteria) \n1. There will only be one rollback attempt on an alert (to avoid an endless loop of rollbaks) \n\n### Acceptance criteria\n* Add settings section for the user to configure Auto-rollback on/off to CI/CD project settings above `Deploy freezes`\n - Features a single checkbox with label and help text and a confirmation button.\n* Rollback is to the last successful deployment (This will re-run the pipeline of the last successful deployment)\n* Auto rollback must be logged in the audit log as an action done in the pipeline\n* For the first iteration - any critical alert will trigger a rollback\n* Confirmation is a primary success button\n* Copy of settings UI:\n```\nAutomatic deployment rollbacks\n\nAutomatically roll back to the last successful deployment when a critical problem is detected.\n\n- [ ] Enable automatic rollbacks\n      Automatic rollbacks start when a critical alert is triggered. If the last successful deployment fails to roll \n      back automatically, it can still be done manually. More information\n```\n\n| Mockup (browser made)  |\n| --- |\n| ![image](/uploads/a3ee53ba1d2f56177232caf1f612c11f/image.png) |\n| Note: Copy might differ from the mockup, see acceptance criteria above |\n\n**Out of scope for this issue**:\n\n* Metrics will be defined on a a dedicated yml file.\n  * Only metrics defined in this YML file will initiate the auto-rollback similar to the common_metrics.yml. [./gitlab/dashbords.yml](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus.html#adding-a-new-dashboard-to-your-project)\n\n\n\n## Engineering scope\n\n**Weight estimate: 3**\n\n* [x]  ~backend: Create a worker to trigger an automatic rollback, should a deployment fail.\n* [x]  ~frontend: Create a switch in the project settings. Users should be able to choose whether rollbacks should be automatic or manual (as highlighted in link posted above)\n* [x]  ~\"Documentation guidelines\" \n\n## Technical proposal\n\n**How GitLab Re-deploy feature behaves today**\n\n- GitLab already knows the list of successful deployments on an environment.\n- GitLab can deduce the latest successful deployment from the deployment list. (Let's say Deployment-A)\n- GitLab can deduce the _previous_ successful deployment from the deployment list and Deployment-A. (Let's say Deployment-B)\n- When Deployment-B is re-deployed, GitLab creates Deployment-C. Deployment-B and C have the same metadata.\n- We can check if a deployment was re-deployed: `project.deployments.where(ref: deployment.ref, sha: deployment.sha).exist?`\n\n**How we will extend**\n\n- Auto Rollback happens **only once** when a **new** critical alert is raised.\n- We cannot simply re-deploy Deployment-B because Deployment-A will be the _previous_ successful deployment which is the next rollback target. This feature keeps deploying Deployment-A and Deployment-B alternatively. Probably that's not what we want. To illustrate:\n  - Deployment-C (latest, same content with Deployment-B)\n  - Deployment-A (previous successful)\n  - Deployment-B (previous previous successful)\n- We need to persist the rollback history as the following.\n  - `deployments.auto_redeployed_by_id` (FK) ... The ID of the deployment initiated the auto re-deploy.\n- Let's say there are two deployments Deployment-A and Deployment-B and a critical alert is raised on the environment.\n  - What is the latest deployment? =\u003e Deployment-A\n  - What is the previous successful deployment? =\u003e Deployment-B\n  - Should GitLab re-deploy Deployment-B? =\u003e Yes\n- Let's say a new critical alert is raised on the environment again.\n  - What is the latest deployment? =\u003e Deployment-C\n  - What is the previous successful deployment? =\u003e Deployment-A\n  - Should GitLab re-deploy Deployment-A? =\u003e No, because Deployment-C was triggered by A. Next.\n  - Should GitLab re-deploy Deployment-B? =\u003e No, because Deployment-C is identical with Deployment-B. Next.\n\n**anti-race condition**\n\n- If there is a running deployment on the environment when a critical alert is raised, this feature won't do anything. (Please see the \"Constant Rollback\" below)\n\n### Which alert is considered as critical?\n\n- `environment.alert_management_alerts` has `severity` column that takes `critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 2, low: 3, info: 4, unknown: 5`. `critical` is the status of an alert that triggers an rollback.\n\n### Rollback range (Next iteration)\n\n- Rollback is a useful operation to revert a problematic code, but it also has a risk to remove a valid code/feature that disturbs end-user's request.\n- Operators should be able to set a rollback range to group backward compatible deployments. Auto Rollback should happen in this current range and shouldn't go across.\n\n### Constant Rollback (Next iteration)\n\n- If a critical alert still exists after the X minutes from the Auto Rollback point. The next Auto Rollback will be triggered.\n\n## Future iterations\n\n* Last version to rollback to (including gitlab-ci.yml file)\n\n## Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nSpinnikar supports a similar feature that specifically designed for Rollback on Kubernetes's Rolling Update:\n\n| Description | Screenshot |\n| --- | --- |\n| A user Can configure which version to rollback to  (for example last version deployed to production)  | ![image](/uploads/cbff917e3fb0d49c0be1e0b7d5e98d9d/image.png) |\n| We should note that for proper rollback, we need to rollback | \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKubernetes Config\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocker images\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egitlab-ci.yml\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e |\n| View of the Kuberenetes Clusters | ![image](/uploads/7551ba3eee27a86172db95275799ed20/image.png) |\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

\n\nA customer like ourselves, coming from a tool like Octopus, that wants strong controls over the deployment steps in their pipelines and/or uses infrastructure as code but would love that to be available in one tool (Gitlab) with the appropriate visibility benefits\n\n### Links / references\nhttps://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/126158\nhttps://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2072#note_234204758\n\n## Implementation\n\n| ~backend | MR |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Add support for CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME to be used in job:rules | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106093 |","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-31T02:25:54.157Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T01:07:29.823Z","closed_at":"2022-12-09T16:56:59.313Z","closed_by":{"id":12867582,"username":"lma-git","name":"Leaminn Ma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12867582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lma-git"},"labels":["CI rules","CI variables","Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Pipeline Authoring","candidate::15.8","customer","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":12867582,"username":"lma-git","name":"Leaminn Ma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12867582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lma-git"}],"author":{"id":4871757,"username":"alister.shipman","name":"alister","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/123518a53d740c1e5823787793d69378?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alister.shipman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":12867582,"username":"lma-git","name":"Leaminn Ma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12867582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lma-git"},"user_notes_count":47,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":26,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35315","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35315","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35315/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35315/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#35315","relative":"#35315","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#35315"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4401,"epic":{"id":112233,"iid":4401,"title":"Add support for more variables to `rules` expressions","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4401","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26504215,"iid":35311,"project_id":278964,"title":"User not redirected to Environment URL when URL is clicked","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nTesting out Review App functionality for Salesforce development.

That is, the Vulnerability should be available before the _confirmation_ of a Finding.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nThis change simplifies the Findings/Vulnerabilities UX greatly and reduces the required amount of ~frontend work.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIt was decided that every **new** Finding getting to the default branch should auto-create the associated first-class Vulnerability object. The newly created Vulnerability will be in _opened_ state. After, it could be made _confirmed_, _resolved_, or _dismissed_.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo new or changed permissions are required. Auto-created Vulnerabilities are going to be [confidential](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34430).\n\n### Documentation\n\nNo documentation is going to be added. This is a backstage change that does not touch any public APIs. The [First-class Vulnerabilities feature](#13561) in general is hidden behind the feature flag.

As we're introducing the ability to assign issues to more than one concurrent timebox (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/5135) to support traditional planning methodologies such as Scrum, we need a way to identify what the milestone is from a data perspective so we can eventually add improved reporting across a given timebox type, auto schedule cadence for types, etc. \n\nSee this epic (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/69) for the bigger picture. \n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nThis will unlock future enhancements such as:\n\n- Auto moving issues from one milestone to another of the same type. \n- Issues to be associated to both a sprint, version, or release simultaneously. \n- Calculating velocity and volatility over `n` previous timeboxes.\n\nCurrent users are tracking sprints within GitLab, then exporting issues on a regular cadence to track longer run timeboxes like releases or projects. This will alleviate the need to work externally from GitLab to get this level of reporting. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n#### Summary \n\n- Add the ability to enable/disable three timebox types within a top level group's settings.\n- Default is one enabled timebox named \"Milestone\". This cannot be toggled off. One timebox must always be enabled.\n\n#### Fringe Cases\n\n**When an issue moves to another a project or group that does not have the same timebox types enabled:**\n\nPrompt with a warning dialogue - `You are moving an issue into a group that does not have X, Y, and Z timebox enabled. These will be removed from the issue if you continue` - `Move Anyways` `Cancel`\n\n**Deleting types....**\n\nTypes can't be deleted, just enabled/disabled. \n\n#### UX\n\n[Discussion regarding the proposed UX](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35290#note_268955101)\n\n\n![Timebox_Flow_Update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/1da2a5feb7673929e46a2d3fee95a8c2/Timebox_Flow_Update.png)\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n- Stay inline with current milestones permission level of `Developer` and above. \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- Yes, we will need documentation.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n- To be determined during the implementation planning.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n#### Success Metrics\n\n- Count of timebox types being enabled and which ones are used most frequently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Proposal is generally satisfied.\n- [ ] GraphQL first\n- [ ] Rest API supported\n- [ ] `gitlab-ui` first. If new components are required, add them there first.\n- [ ] Telemetry added to capture success metrics.\n- [ ] Graph added to `Plan` dashboard in Periscope.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nBased on our current understanding, any reasonable manager that is utilizing modern agile planning practices would buy this feature. Based on our [four pricing tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers), this would fall into the ~\"GitLab Starter\" tier.\n\n### Links / references\n\n- None\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-30T18:17:37.101Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:04:26.719Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T13:23:50.817Z","closed_by":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","GitLab Starter","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::plan","direction","docs::feature","documentation","frontend","group::project management","missed:12.9","planning priority","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":610592,"iid":24,"group_id":9970,"title":"Awaiting further demand","description":"Indicates that an issue has been triaged, but is not yet on the backlog because it is awaiting further demand from customers.","state":"active","created_at":"2018-08-01T12:23:44.946Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T12:23:44.946Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/24"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":74,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35290","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":0,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35290","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35290/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35290/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#35290","relative":"#35290","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#35290"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26495256,"iid":35283,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update deprecated GraphQL description fields with `deprecation_reason`","description":"Context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19233#note_236587411 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19233#note_236528553.\n\nDepends on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31645 and the decision from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/32292","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-30T16:50:18.274Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T06:57:11.675Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T06:57:11.632Z","closed_by":{"id":3717078,"username":"cablett","name":"charlie ablett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3717078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cablett"},"labels":["GraphQL","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::plan","documentation","group::product planning","missed:12.5","section::dev","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Normally, GitLab removes Todo  after a one hour grace period when a user for example leaves a project or does not have access to the feature anymore. However, this is not applied in the case of sharing a project with a group. If a project is shared within a group, the group members receive Todos, e.g., when they are mentioned on issues.\n\nHowever, when the shared group is removed from the project, Todo for all group members persist. By using the REST API of GitLab, a user can get much more associated information of the Todo. He now can receives for example the full issue, including the title, and description. Note, this is always the fresh and most recent version, which might have changed after the group was removed from the project. Furthermo\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Share a private project with another group according to the documentation in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/share_project_with_groups.html  \n2. As a group member, go to one issue of the project, and add a personal Todo via the `Add a To Do` button in the sidebar of the issue  \n3. Remove the group from the project  \n4. Wait for one hour grace period  \n5. As the group member, perform the following API call: `curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cTOKEN\u003e\" https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/todos`\n\nThis now returns the old Todo from the previously shared project, which you don't have access to anymore.  \nThis looks similar to the JSON response below. Note, this contains small parts of the private project but also the full details of the issue. The issue here is the most recent version. So if someone from the the project changes the issue description, you also see that here!\n\n```json  \n[\n    {  \n        \"id\": 227,  \n        \"project\": {  \n            \"id\": 17,  \n            \"description\": \"\",  \n            \"name\": \"my-private-project\",  \n            \"name_with_namespace\": \"testuser / my-private-project\",  \n            \"path\": \"my-private-project\",  \n            \"path_with_namespace\": \"testuser/my-private-project\",  \n            \"created_at\": \"2019-10-24T08:24:25.844Z\"  \n        },  \n        \"author\": {  \n            \"id\": 4,  \n            \"name\": \"testuser\",  \n            \"username\": \"testuser\",  \n            \"state\": \"active\",  \n            \"avatar_url\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d113f00d385aac3f93dcda1532432ee8?s=80\u0026d=identicon\",  \n            \"web_url\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/testuser\"  \n        },  \n        \"action_name\": \"directly_addressed\",  \n        \"target_type\": \"Issue\",  \n        \"target\": {  \n            \"id\": 527,  \n            \"iid\": 2,  \n            \"project_id\": 17,  \n            \"title\": \"Critical security release\",  \n            \"description\": \"We need to fix this RCE vulnerability ASAP [@]all\",  \n            \"state\": \"opened\",  \n            \"created_at\": \"2019-10-24T08:34:07.028Z\",  \n            \"updated_at\": \"2019-10-24T08:34:07.028Z\",  \n            \"closed_at\": null,  \n            \"closed_by\": null,  \n            \"labels\": [],  \n            \"milestone\": null,  \n            \"assignees\": [],  \n            \"author\": {  \n                \"id\": 4,  \n                \"name\": \"testuser\",  \n                \"username\": \"testuser\",  \n                \"state\": \"active\",  \n                \"avatar_url\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d113f00d385aac3f93dcda1532432ee8?s=80\u0026d=identicon\",  \n                \"web_url\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/testuser\"  \n            },  \n            \"assignee\": null,  \n            \"user_notes_count\": 0,  \n            \"merge_requests_count\": 0,  \n            \"upvotes\": 0,  \n            \"downvotes\": 0,  \n            \"due_date\": null,  \n            \"confidential\": true,  \n            \"discussion_locked\": null,  \n            \"web_url\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/testuser/my-private-project/issues/2\",  \n            \"time_stats\": {  \n                \"time_estimate\": 0,  \n                \"total_time_spent\": 0,  \n                \"human_time_estimate\": null,  \n                \"human_total_time_spent\": null  \n            },  \n            \"task_completion_status\": {  \n                \"count\": 0,  \n                \"completed_count\": 0  \n            },  \n            \"has_tasks\": false,  \n            \"_links\": {  \n                \"self\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/17/issues/2\",  \n                \"notes\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/17/issues/2/notes\",  \n                \"award_emoji\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/17/issues/2/award_emoji\",  \n                \"project\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/17\"  \n            },  \n            \"subscribed\": false  \n        },  \n        \"target_url\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/testuser/my-private-project/issues/2\",  \n        \"body\": \"We need to fix this RCE vulnerability ASAP\",  \n        \"state\": \"pending\",  \n        \"created_at\": \"2019-10-24T08:34:07.094Z\"  \n    }  \n]\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is actually quite high. A malicious user of the group, can simply add a personal todo on all issues, including confidential issues, and merge requests of the project. This can easily be one `Add a To Do` in the sidebar of an issue or merge request. After the group is removed from the project, the malicious user has access to all issues and merge requests. Note, this always returns the most recent version of the issue or merge request!\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nTodos are not redacted when the group is removed as a project member.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen the group is removed from the project, wait for the 1h grace period, and then remove all todos on the project for the group members.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com currently running on GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.3.0-pre d92a13b6173 but also on local installation on GitLab 12.4.0.\n\nBest regards,  \nXanbanx\n\n## Impact\n\nSee

Currently we raise an error when a filter isn't provided, meaning we can't process those requests.\n\nFiltering is an optional part of the [SCIM spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.3), so we are required to support requests that do not have a filter. This will help increase the number of SCIM providers we support, and reduce the chance that our Azure integration breaks.\n\nBonus: this will help Group admins to query `externalId` values for troubleshooting, so will help with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33378","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-30T02:03:03.822Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T10:27:29.233Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T21:08:06.789Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","scim","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"}],"author":{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35209","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35209","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35209/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/35209/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#35209","relative":"#35209","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#35209"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1774,"epic":{"id":11022,"iid":1774,"title":"Okta SCIM Support","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1774","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26462307,"iid":35206,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow up: consolidate cycle analytics URLs","description":"Follow up to the discussion https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18514#note_237573162\n\nWe should move the endpoints required for cycle analytics requests into the API module.

In such merge requests the project path and branch name of private forked projects publicly visible in request to merge sections.\n\nThe project path is continues to be visible even when forked relationship is removed and then updated paths are visible too.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a public project  \n2. Fork it in private project  \n3. Create a merge request from private to public project  \n4. Now login as non member and visit the above merge request. You should see the path of the private forked project publicly along with the name in `Request to merge` section of merge request.\n\n![Screenshot_2019-10-29_at_21.08.28.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/94130af1-a0db-41d8-8514-e987bd6c120e/Screenshot_2019-10-29_at_21.08.28.png)\n\n5. Now remove the fork relationship from private project and update the path of the private project  \n6. Again visit the same merge request and you should see the updated name too!\n\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nShows the private forked project path and branch name publicly in merge requests.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIf forked project is private, none of its information should be visible publicly.\n\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too!\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nPrivate project path and branch name visible in merge requests publicly if project is forked in private projects\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

This way we'd gain the benefits of:\n\n- User can see the href before the click.\n- Right clicking causes \"Open in New Tab\" to appear.\n- Meta clicking natively works.\n\n## Point 1 - Should we disable click-on-row and only support click on the text of each \"clickable\" element? ~UX \n\nThis includes the link to modules as seen in this screenshot:\n\n![Screenshot_2020-02-11_at_08.40.56](/uploads/e1fcc0be9733812f48de118777208642/Screenshot_2020-02-11_at_08.40.56.png)\n\n\nMore details from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35250:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ePrevious discussion on the topic\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\n- [ ] @pslaughter started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19228#note_237457406):  (+5 comments)\n\n    \u003e **question (non-blocking):** @mvanremmerden is clicking on the file row a feature we're interested in supporting?

A user adds a merge request to a merge train\n1. The system creates a pipeline for merge train and it starts running\n1. A user accidentally removes the merge request from a merge train\n1. A user enables \"Add to merge train when pipeline succeeds\" on the merge request\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n- User sees disabled Merge button with the text \"The pipeline for this merge request failed. Please retry the job or push a new commit to fix the failure\".\n  This is because the project enables \"Pipeline must succeed\" option.\n- User doesn't have a way to re-add the merge request to a merge train because of that.\n- Since the merge request has already been dropped from a merge train,\n  the pipeline will fail by `fatal: Couldn't find remote ref`. This is an expected behavior.\n\n## Workaround:\n\n1. The quickest workaround is disabling \"Pipeline must succeed\" option, because it's technically covered by merge train's functionality already.\n2. if you do not want to disable the option, here is another workaround.\n   - Click \"Run pipeline\" button in \"Pipelines\" tab in the merge request\n   - Enables \"Add to merge train when pipeline succeeds\"\n3. add a comment to the MR using the `/merge` action keyword. That re-adds the MR to the merge train and merges if the pipeline succeeded.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nUsers should be able to easily add the merge request back to the train without leaving the overview page- from the merge widget itself.  \n\n### Proposal\n\n- Backend - An MR to enable the following in the backend:#336799 \n\u003e we need ~backend to return the `pipeline.merge_request_event_type` to the ~frontend (either via GraphQL or REST serializer, depending which one is used today)\n\n- Frontend - Implement the mentioned table in the frontend\n\n\n| Pipeline event | Pipeline status | Button | Message |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------|---------|\n| merge train pipeline | failed | Add to merge train | `The merge train pipeline failed.

For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nCurrently, `client/features` endpoint and `feature_flag_scopes` endpoint do not have a pagination. This is because unleash clients are not compatible with pagination and all flags should be populated in one request.\n\nHowever, this leaves a scalability concern that if there are too many feature flags per project, this endpoint will likely fail by database statement timeout or Unicorn/Puma request timeout. So we should limit the number of flags somehow.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group.

Stored XSS in merge request pages","description":"**[HackerOne report #723307](https://hackerone.com/reports/723307)** by `mike12` on 2019-10-26, assigned to @ankelly:\n\nHello Gitlab!\n\n[Vulnerable code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/9d81e97d9d111f874799605ce50ae480ae15b0c5/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/states/mr_widget_rebase.vue#L47)\n\nTo reproduce the bug, we need to open a merge request with the following conditions:  \n1. Project must have 'Merge commit with semi-linear history' or 'Fast-forward merge' merge method  \n2. The merge request must require rebase before fast-forward/merge  \n3. A visitor of the merge request page must not have permissions to push to source branch  \n4. Target branch name must have a special name `\u003cimg/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e` :) \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n1. Run Gitlab `docker run --detach --hostname gitlab.example.com --publish 443:443 --publish 80:80 --publish 22:22 --name gitlab gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest`  \n2. Create a new project  \n3. Go to the project settings and set the 'Merge method' to 'Fast-forward merge' or 'Merge commit with semi-linear history' ![project-settings.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/d89894c0-55a8-41ec-a64f-cc541efdf188/project-settings.png)  \n4. Clone the repository and run the following in the repository:\n\n    ```bash  \n    touch 1.txt  \n    git add 1.txt  \n    git commit -m \"initial commit\"  \n    git push origin master  \n      \n    git checkout -b \"\u003cimg/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e\"  \n    touch 2.txt  \n    git add 2.txt  \n    git commit -m \"add 2.txt\"  \n    git push origin \"\u003cimg/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e\"  \n      \n    git checkout master  \n    touch 3.txt  \n    git add 3.txt  \n    git commit -m \"add 3.txt\"  \n    git push origin master  \n    ```\n\n5. Create a merge request `master` =\u003e `\u003cimg/src='x'/onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e`  \n6. Then we have to visit the merge request page under a user who does not have permissions to push to the source branch (in our case, `master` branch). For example:   \n  * Make the project public and visit the merge request page under any user who does not have permissions in the project (or without authorization)  \n  * Invite a user to the project, but without permissions to push to the source branch.\n\n![example1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b1c00729-3b0a-401e-8645-80a53707aa45/example1.png)  \n![example2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7b7ff594-081b-43e4-8047-4ba35182bc55/example2.png)  \n![example3.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b2605b01-7c48-4019-80b1-4da6febc78d3/example3.png)\n\n```bash  \nroot@gitlab:/# gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info\n\nSystem information  \nSystem:\t\t  \nCurrent User:\tgit  \nUsing RVM:\tno  \nRuby Version:\t2.6.3p62  \nGem Version:\t2.7.9  \nBundler Version:1.17.3  \nRake Version:\t12.3.3  \nRedis Version:\t3.2.12  \nGit Version:\t2.22.0  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.7  \nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:\t12.4.0  \nRevision:\t1425a56c75b  \nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails  \nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL  \nDB Version:\t10.9  \nURL:\t\thttp://gitlab.example.com  \nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://gitlab.example.com/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@gitlab.example.com:some-group/some-project.git  \nUsing LDAP:\tno  \nUsing Omniauth:\tyes  \nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:\t10.2.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell  \nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git  \nroot@gitlab:/#   \n```\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can:\n\n1.

For example, `write_repository` is limited, which prevents a pipeline from pushing changes back to the repository it is working on.\n\nThese are sensible basic defaults, but some pipelines need the ability to do things like write to the repository, write to the registry, access to the API, and so on. GitLab needs a way for project administrators to bump up the level of access back up to the full capabilities of the running user in situations where they are needed.\n\nIt's important to call out that it will not be possible to elevate a users permissions beyond the permission they have using this method.\n\n### Communication with GitLab\n\nUsers use Personal Access Tokens to communicate with GitLab, but these are not secure enough.\n\nThe problem here is that in order to communicate with GitLab users need to use Personal Access Tokens. Another way could be using a `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` but these tokens can not access API because it is not possible to configure their scopes, [like it is possible for PATs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#limiting-scopes-of-a-personal-access-token).\n\nBecause a `$CI_JOB_TOKEN`, that is injected by GitLab into the context of a CI/CD build, can not be used with API, users are using personal access tokens, and there are few important differences between PATs and job tokens.\n\nThe most important difference is that `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` is an ephemeral token, it can be revoked after a build is complete, it might not be used until a build is running. Another important difference is that a `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` is different for every build, and for every user.\n\nUsers that are injecting PATs into their builds, inject the same PAT all the time, and their colleagues can easily see that token, thus it is not secure enough. Every builds receives the same PAT, the token is not revoked when a build is done.\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\nThis issue originated out of the comment thread at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/20416#note_216069060.\n\nThe current set of scopes that are possible are as follows:\n\n![image](/uploads/96748fdbc2da230af84e480f166e5e8f/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nGitlab is already an OAUTH2.0 authorization/resource server and tokens are already oauth2 access token, so we can use its full power to solve this issue. \n\nThere are three main components to us delivering this feature:\n\n* Change the backend to use JWT instead of access tokens for build permissions\n* Expose the necessary JWKs endpoint(s) and facilities to allow external systems to validate the authenticity of the minted tokens\n* Design and implement a UX for people to control what scopes (things like `read_repository`, `read_registry`, `read_api`, `write_repository`, etc.. basically the ones you can choose from in the access token dialog) are given for the resources.\n\nA resource is defined as a project or maybe group, and then scopes are applied to resources.\n\nA user will never be able to get more permissions than the user has through this mechanism, so even if `read_api` is turned on in the scope, if the user does not have that ability they don't get it for free. This could maybe be something that comes in a future iteration, but we are not touching it now.\n\nWe are also not supporting different scope evaluation depending on the target environment, branch, etc., but will limit all destructive operations (all writes on API, except registry image creation) to be locked to protected jobs. This is because pipelines can run a ton of untrusted code, and with fork pipelines running in parent we will run even more.\n\n#### New Scopes\n\nThere are a few scopes that may need to be added for additional functionality of this feature:\n\n* read_package_registry: this is a new scope, but currently users can grant read/write permission only via the `api` scope\n* write_package_registry: also a new scope, which will help avoid granting full `api` scope for writing to the package registries.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nFrom @ayufan at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/20416#note_230466323\n\n1. Change `ci_builds.token` to be JWT,\n1. The `JWT` expiry time is `max(runner_timeout, project_timeout)+1h?`,\n1. Make `JWT` to hold information about `build_id/pipeline_id/project_id/user_id` and assigned scopes and abilities granted, similar to how we do that for container registry,\n1. Make the other `JWT` scopes to be constructed from project settings where you are allowed to specify additional abilities (a scopes) for another projects that you want to access.\n1. UI up to choosing I guess, but ideally I would see it like: adding a new project, choosing the scope (likely simple CRUD interface).\n\nThe biggest change is change of token to JWT. This is to make the further processing of scope much simpler to implement on all parts of the system. It improves the security of runner communication by creating short-living token, and makes this flexible to handle in generic way addition of new scopes and projects. This is also efficient, as handling JWT is very cheap to do.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nEven for the MVC we need a way to disable this feature at the group and instance level. This is a requirement in compliance driven environments where elevating access (even to the user's full access level) may not be permitted. It should be on by default, but easy to disable under these scenarios.\n\n### Documentation\n- [NPM Registry Authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#authenticating-to-the-gitlab-npm-registry)\n- [Maven Repository Authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token)\n- [Conan Repository Authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/conan_repository/#authenticating-to-the-gitlab-conan-repository)\n- [Container Registry Authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/#using-with-private-projects)\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Future Improvements\n\n1. In the near term, implementing permission controls using OAuth2 scopes could likely be done in a way sufficiently robust enough to handle operations against a single Project. I think this becomes much trickier if a given job wanted to, say, clone another repo (or repos), update it with changes, and push it back up. Policy-based Access Control seems like a better fit in the mid / long term as it presents an opportunity to unify the different token types. Maybe we could express the scopes as policies under the hood to make this easier in the future.\n1. The fractured CI identity model is likely going to need to be addressed regardless of how permissions are expressed. When a `CI_JOB_TOKEN` hits the API, *who* does the API think it is? It's not the user. It *is* a robot with some subset of the users permissions. There doesn't yet exist an entity in GitLab to represent this. (plug for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/24123#note_215458587)\n1. This feature and the necessary refactoring present a good opportunity to introduce a first-class expirable credential API.\n\n### Links /

Use GitLab.com or configure GitLab instance with `group_saml` (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/master/doc/howto/saml.md#gitlab-configuration)\n1. Create a Group and configure SAML SSO\n1. Enable SSO Enforcement, although this may not be required\n1. Enable 2FA for a user\n1. Attempt to sign in with SSO for that group\n1. Enter an incorrect 2FA code 10 times to trigger a 10 minute lock on sign ins\n1. Hit 500 error, although an email is still sent\n1. Check email and click the unlock link sent from GitLab\n1. Navigate back to the SSO sign in page and attempt sign in if presented with a form.\n1. Users have reported being unable to sign in still, but I can't reproduce this\n\n## Expected behaviour\n\nWith password sign in unlocking allows password sign in to take place again.\n\nIdeally we'd show instructions for resetting 2FA at some point.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nTODO: Screenshots of the flow, or screencap.\n\n### Next steps\n\nInvestigate how SSO callback behaviour is different to SessionController when 2FA has been previously locked.\n\nInvestigate why users are triggering 2FA lock outs. Are users confused and entering the 2FA for their identity provider instead of for GitLab? Is something else triggering the lock out?","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-25T17:57:58.898Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T10:50:22.467Z","closed_at":"2020-02-05T10:50:22.418Z","closed_by":{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"},"labels":["2FA","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","missed:12.5","missed:12.6","missed:12.7","saml","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"}],"author":{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":654619,"username":"jamedjo","name":"James Edwards-Jones","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/654619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamedjo"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34998","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34998","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34998/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34998/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34998","relative":"#34998","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34998"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1785,"epic":{"id":11091,"iid":1785,"title":"Group SSO: Stability, Availability, and Security","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1785","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26317469,"iid":34980,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove obsolete code for date-pickers of Productivity Analytics","description":"The following discussion from !17933 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @djensen started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/17933#note_235277694):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e Is `Time.zone.now` configured to return the User's timezone?
