[{"id":30979299,"iid":207128,"project_id":278964,"title":"Replace x-y-stable docker images with major tag for Security Products","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nFor some of our tools (SAST, Dependency Scanning, License Management) the current process implies to release a new `x-y-stable` docker image tag every month when there is a new version of GitLab. All these `x-y-stable` images are actually using a Major tag under the hood.\n\nThis process has a maintenance cost with no particular benefit now that we have the vendored templates shipping within the GitLab rails application. So we want to get rid of it.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\nCurrently, when we release a new version of a tool:\n\n1. we publish a new semantic version with a git tag: `1.2.4`\n1. we publish a corresponding docker image: `sast:1.2.4`\n1. we override the corresponding major docker image: `sast:1`\n1. we override the existing `x-y-stable` images that are (supposed to be) compatible with that major version: `11-6-stable`, `11-7-stable`, etc.\n\nAnd when there is a new monthly release of GitLab we update the CI config to add a new job to publish a corresponding `x-y-stable`.\n\nFor the Analyzers, we have quite a similar process but stop at step `#3` and use the major tag that is matching the major version of the tool (SAST, DS). Though, this is also being replaced with the non-DinD approach by now having a dedicated job per analyzer that can directly use their own versions.\n\n### Proposal\n\nFor DS and SAST, the DinD mode requires to sync the major version of the tool with the major version of the analyzers. With the removal of Dind, this is no longer necessary and each analyzer could then follow their own semantic versioning and have independent Major versions too.\n\nAsk customers to override the job definition to change the version they want to use.\n\n#### Dependency Scanning\n\nTemplate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n- deprecate `DS_MAJOR_VERSION` and directly use the major number here.\n\n#### SAST\n\nTemplate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n- deprecate `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG` and directly use the major number here.\n\n#### Container Scanning\n\nTemplate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n- deprecate `CS_MAJOR_VERSION` and directly use the major number here.\n\n#### License Compliance\n\nTemplate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/License-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml (and the deprecated https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/License-Management.gitlab-ci.yml)\n\n- replace `$CI_SERVER_VERSION_MAJOR-$CI_SERVER_VERSION_MINOR-stable` and directly use the major number here.\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- [ ] ensure documentation states the deprecation of `x-y-stable` docker images and related env variables and that support will be dropped in %\"13.0\".\n- [ ] update the release process doc in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/release\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nThis will need thorough testing and make sure that the automated QA is kept compatible.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWe publish docker images matching semantic versions of our tools (and just keep pushing `x-y-stable` images too until we officially drop support for them in %\"13.0\").\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references\n[Release post deprecation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/43218)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-18T16:58:09.293Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T10:40:40.515Z","closed_at":"2020-04-21T20:19:24.238Z","closed_by":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","backend-weight::3","backstage [DEPRECATED]","deprecation","devops::secure","group::static analysis","maintenance::refactor","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207128","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207128","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207128/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207128/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207128","relative":"#207128","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207128"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3246,"epic":{"id":51772,"iid":3246,"title":"Simplify \u0026 Cleanup","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3246","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30977737,"iid":207125,"project_id":278964,"title":"Generate JWT for authentication and provide it to CI jobs","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nWe want to support existing Vault users with a lightweight integration using JWT.

Currently when I turn-off GMA all dependent toggles are turned-off automatically. This behavior ignores actual stored values, so \"prohibited_outer_forks\" toggle will be shown as turned off even if the value in database is true.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nCheckout 34648-restrict-forking-outside-of-gma-part-2 branch\r\nMigrate database\r\nGo to Group SAML page of a new group\r\nTurn on GMA toggle\r\n=\u003e Prohibit outer forks is turned off regardless of DB value (true).\r\nExpected: \"Prohibit outer forks\" should be ON by default (which is reflected in default DB value) when GMA is enabled.\r\n\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIn general I find this behavior as weak UX. Currently we have 4 dependent toggles: Enabled, Enforce SSO, Enable GMA, Prohibit Outer Forks. Imagine a use case where group owner needs to temporary disable Group SAML =\u003e They turn \"Enabled\" toggle off =\u003e other 3 toggles are wiped out to \"off\" state =\u003e when owner will turn it back they'll have to restore back other 3 toggles manually.... if they remember how it was before.\r\n\r\nI remember a while ago we were \"hiding\" dependent toggles without changing their state. What was wrong with that?\r\n\u003c/details\u003e\r\n\r\nAs a further improvements to our UX I suggest that instead of toggling options, which are currently unavailable we will mark these as disabled (we already have this pattern in `Settings -\u003e General` for projects). This will allow us:\r\n\r\n* to prevent clearing current settings due to occasional toggling\r\n* allow the user to temporary disable, for example, GMA while keeping `Prohibit outer forks` settings on - it will be applied again as soon as GMA will be turned on again\r\n* Properly communicate defaults (now `Prohibit outer forks` is turned on by default, which is absolutely unclear from UI)\r\n\r\nGenerally, I consider hiding toggles as poor UX (and it was removed from this page ~10 months ago), while disabling will allow us to communicate theoretically available options to user\r\n\r\n/cc @pshutsin @dennis @jeremy ","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-18T09:19:54.500Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T18:02:00.131Z","closed_at":"2020-03-09T22:48:04.634Z","closed_by":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::manage","estimation::completed","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"}],"author":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207083","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207083","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207083/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207083/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207083","relative":"#207083","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207083"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30957785,"iid":207079,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move POST create_deploy_token to ci_cd resources","description":"As of 12.9, we have in `config/routes/project.rb`\n```ruby\n      resource :repository, only: [:show], controller: :repository do\n        #

is raised if the bridge is not `active` when calling `update_bridge_status!`. The bridge may not be `active` because it could be dropped if errors occur [when creating a downstream pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/3598338b27beb0955aec85135d56213b30554ccf/app/services/ci/create_cross_project_pipeline_service.rb#L32) - introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24092 and modified also in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24735 - /cc @matteeyah \n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24665/diffs we [increased the number of times](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/3598338b27beb0955aec85135d56213b30554ccf/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb#L217) that `update_bridge_status!` can be called. - @dosuken123 \n\nI have the feeling that the 2 changes together are causing this issue.\n\n#### Tests\n\nI've ran different tests and observed the followings:\n\n- using `strategy:depend` we see the bridge job failing immediately while the child pipeline works correctly\n- without `strategy:depend` we see the bridge job passing immediately but creates duplicate child pipelines. All these child pipelines have the same bridge as source.\n\nThe primary challenge is that I could not reproduce this on my local environment, neither using the latest `master` nor the [current staging version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commits/3598338b27b).\n\nI did reproduce it consistently on staging.\n\n### Solutions\n\n- As a quick fix we could avoid raising `Ci::Pipeline::BridgeStatusError` and instead ignore the operation. This would not retrigger the workers, making things worse.\n- We then need to understand exactly under what circumstances this can fail.\n- We should enforce the constraint that a bridge job can source only 1 pipeline.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-14T15:42:33.037Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T19:14:28.546Z","closed_at":"2020-02-16T04:44:18.957Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich

Many go projects, however, do not use a semantic versioning scheme so that in the lockfile, pseudo-versions appear instead of semantic versions (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196520 for more details). This is the fallback mechanism used by the go ECO system in the absence of proper semantic versions. \n\nAs gemnasium can only process semantic versions (instead of pseudo-versions) at the moment, for all go dependencies that use a non-semantic versioning scheme, we cannot detect potentially vulnerable dependencies possibly leading to false negatives. \n\nThe root cause for this issue is that we do not have a dedicate vrange tool for go in the [gemnasium project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) that can cope with pseudo-versions. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n### Proposal\n\nHaving a dedicated vrange tool for go that leverages the native semantic version library would ensure that the version matching behaves the same on the analyzer side as it does for go and would help to move the complexity of properly matching semantic versions and pseudo versions out of the [gemnasium project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium). We could use https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/advisory-db-curation-tools/-/tree/master/adbcurate/vadapters/go as a starting point for that.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] update Gemnasium to support Go pseudo-versions https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/115\n  - add a new version range resolver specific to Go\n  - introduce translate query functions, to translate version range queries prior to evaluation them\n  - implement a translate query function for Go, to handle pseudo-versions\n  - update scanner test\n  - release new version\n- [x] update test project [tests/go-modules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/go-modules) to cover Go pseudo-versions https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/go-modules/-/merge_requests/59\n\n### Documentation\n\nSince the current limitation isn't documented, there's no doc update for this change.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nA vrange tool that can successfully match semantic versions and pseudo versions.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\n### Links / references\n\n/cc @fcatteau @ifrenkel","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-14T12:37:46.490Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T17:22:06.698Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T14:59:36.829Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::feature","vulnerability research::advisory","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":3558825,"username":"julianthome","name":"Julian Thome","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/430b3beed4f9690ad2344180202ad27b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/julianthome"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205687","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205687","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205687/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205687/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#205687","relative":"#205687","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#205687"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1664,"epic":{"id":10154,"iid":1664,"title":"Dependency Scanning - Viable to Complete","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1664","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 28, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":44100342,"iid":222455,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove namespaces ineligible for trial from subscription list in the trial flow","description":"## Problem\n\nWe are misleading users by offering the ability to attach trials to groups or username that are already in an active trial or which currently have an active Gold-level subscription.

user-level adoption of the Package Registry","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs the Product Manager of the Package Stage and Group at GitLab, I need to measure and report on user-level activity, so that myself and GitLab as an organization can make data-driven decisions. \n\nFor the Package stage, we are focused on driving [GMAU](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#group-monthly-active-users-gmau) and because Package is both the Group and the Stage, [SMAU](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#stage-monthly-active-users-smau). The problem is that we do not currently have the ability to measure this data, because we have not instrumented these events with the usage ping.  \n\n### Intended users\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nUse the [usage ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/telemetry/usage_ping.html#distinct-batch-counters) as a distinct batch counter to measure the adoption of the GitLab Package Registry. \n\n#### Events\n\n- Publish package: Whenever a Maven, NPM, NuGet, Conan, PyPI, Composer package is successfully published to the Package Registry, count the event at the user level. \n- Pull package: Whenever a Maven, NPM, NuGet, Conan, PyPI, Composer or Go* package is successfully installed from the Package Registry, count the event at the user level. \n\n**I did not include Go packages in the publish package event, because they aren't really being published. But I did include them in the installed version. \n\n### Further details\n\n#### Database\n\n- :question: Do we need to add user_id or installed_date to the packages\n- :question: Consider starting to track installs/downloads for reporting back to front-end\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this change\n- As reminder, the usage ping is opt-in only.

Source Group/Project has a label that is being used on an issue board. \n2. This label has an empty string as a description\n3.

On Import, when the label is created, rails converts `description: \"\"` to `description: nil` and saves it.\n5. During import when creating a board, we need to find and associate already created label with newly created board (instead of creating one). \n6. `GroupObjectBuilder` uses 4 attributes to find an existing object. `group_id/title/description/created_at`. The lookup uses `description: \"\"` and fails to find the right label, since `nil != \"\"`, which leads to a relation creation failure (since it tries to create a label with the same title, and fails). \nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/group_object_builder.rb#L28-33\n\nConverting any empty strings to nil before doing a lookup is going to solve this problem. \n\nThis is currently not a problem for Project Import, because it does not rely on `description` to do object lookup https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/group_project_object_builder.rb#L41-41","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-13T19:17:38.052Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T20:46:43.050Z","closed_at":"2020-02-17T12:26:22.449Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["DEPRECATED_group import","Importer:Group Export/Import","devops::manage","group::import","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205521","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205521","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205521/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205521/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#205521","relative":"#205521","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#205521"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1952,"epic":{"id":12745,"iid":1952,"title":"Group Export/Import API","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1952","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 21, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30729656,"iid":205505,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix snippet blob viewers graphql endpoints","description":"In the snippets VUE refactor we make use of the GraphQL endpoints. Specifically, we request for snippets and also the blob, where the blob represents the real content to represent in the view.\n\nEach blob can have two types of viewers: `simple_viewer` and `rich_viewer`. A `simple_viewer` represents the text with lines codes and with the syntax highlighted. A `rich_viewer` represents the data in a custom way, because the content can be a binary or a non binary one with special format, like markdown.\n\nIn the current state, we're not returning the proper info to the FE and we need to address that. When the requested info is for the `simpleData` attribute in GraphQL, handled by `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/presenters/snippet_blob_presenter.rb#L17`, we need to return always the context highlighted. Basically we would need to change that line to `highlighted(plain: false)`.\n\nBut, the problem is with the `richData` attribute. When the content is binary, we don't render anything, nevertheless, there are 4 types of files that can have a rich viewer attached: SVG, openapi, notebook, and markup. If the blob is not one of those types, the blob won't have a `rich_viewer`. The file type is based on the `snippet#file_name` attribute.\n\nAnd how the content for `richData` is rendered? Well, this is the bad part, the logic is spread across the views. For example:\n\n- SVG type is handled by `app/views/projects/blob/viewers/_svg.html.haml`\n- notebook type is handled by `app/views/projects/blob/viewers/_notebook.html.haml`\n- openapi type is handled by `app/views/projects/blob/viewers/_openapi.html.haml`\n- markdown type is handled by `app/views/projects/blob/viewers/_markup.html.haml`\n\nAt the moment the FE is creating their own viewers, so basically it will have to create a viewer for each one of these rich types and then, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/presenters/snippet_blob_presenter.rb#L4 we should handle the file type and render the content based on the logic inside the views.\n\nThat is one solution, but the less optimal. Why? because when we add a new blob type rendered, we will have to:\n- First, create a view in haml to handle the logic\n- Second, remember to update https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/presenters/snippet_blob_presenter.rb\n- Third, remember to update the FE to add the new type\n\nThe most optimal solution would be to remove all these viewers from the FE and dump whatever the backend sends in the `richData` attribute. To implement this basically we would need to render, from the presenter, the specific view, and that is not an easy task. Invoking the rendering outside a controller is a headache and, even more, when the views can call helpers and routes. I started to work on this in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/fj-fix-blob-viewers-graphql, nevertheless there are still some errors in the specs.\n\nMy suggestion is to continue or see how we can render the viewers view directly and return that. Otherwise, we will have to go for the boring solution, replication what the views do to render the content.\n\n#### More info\n\nThere is a great deep dive about GrapQL in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/issues/1, although there is no need to touch the GraphQL code.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-13T18:48:16.852Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T07:07:53.977Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T23:19:39.139Z","closed_by":{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo Luna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4717243/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_luna"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","GraphQL","backend","devops::create","group::editor","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo Luna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4717243/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_luna"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo Luna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4717243/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_luna"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205505","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205505","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205505/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205505/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#205505","relative":"#205505","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#205505"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30721223,"iid":205458,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make the merge-ref head a keep-around ref","description":"The following discussion from !23157 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @oswaldo started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23157#note_273265913):  (+8 comments)\n\n    \u003e Should we be using `repository.keep_around` at the `merge_ref_head.sha` whenever it's updated in order to not lose track of the latest ref (given we're not persisting anything yet)?\n\nWe need to investigate whether running `git gc` causes a problem with retrieving a diff by comparing with HEAD","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-13T15:07:15.448Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T15:57:22.088Z","closed_at":"2022-07-22T15:57:22.049Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","group::source code","maintenance::refactor","missed:12.10","missed:12.9","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Typically I want to enable a new feature only for myself in production before I enable it for everyone else. To achieve this, we can use the “UserWithIdStrategy”. This strategy allows you to specify a list of user IDs that you want to expose the new feature for. (A user id may, of course, be an email if that is more appropriate in your system.)\n\n### Parameters\n\nuserIds - List of user IDs you want the feature toggle to be enabled for\n\n\n\nSimilar to Unleash API, where `userIDList` should be replaced with `groupList `.\n`groupList` contains a `userIDList`\n\n```\n {\n      \"name\": \"Feature.B\",\n      \"description\": \"lorem ipsum\",\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"strategies\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"ActiveForUserWithId\",\n          \"parameters\": {\n            \"userIdList\": \"123,221,998\"\n          }\n}\n```\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nA group can only be created by someone that is a maintainer of a project or higher.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

Chatops issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214676\n2. The API to use for the chatops call https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29698 \n3. Example work https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196799\n4. An update to the documentation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29697\n\n\n\n### Results \nIn gitlab context, flipper uses a crc32ed comparison, for each actor's id concatenated with the actor, and feature flag name:\n\n```ruby\nZlib.crc32(\"red_featureUser:#{actor.id}\") % (100 * 1_000) \u003c ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE * 1_000]\n```\n\nFlipper (and gitlab config) has the following benefits:\n1. It ensures that the same user is always in the same basket: a user always gets the feature or doesn't get it.\n2. It's a good idea to pad feature flag name (`red_feature`) as input to `crc32`. That's great because we don't want the same actor always getting every feature ON.\n3. One more goodness is that we may do \"multivariate\" experiments with flipper feature flags. So \"all-text-reds\"  and \"all-text-italic\" feature flags would run in combination and we could get `2x2 = 4` combinations of actors.\n4. It's also cool because I can calculate if a user has the feature or no, by using postgres sql:\n```ruby\nselect crc32(\"red_featureUser:#{u.id}\") % (100 * 1000) \u003c ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE * 1000]\n```\n\n5. One more cool thing about flipper and the gitlab implementation is that, in gitlab we care more about \"project\" or \"namespace\" level features (compared to a consumer product which is user-focused). Flipper and its gitlab implementation is quite good for this purpose. Recent SPU and SPAN metrics (stages per user and stages per namespace) put a focus on product features on Namespace or User level mattering much.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-12T12:38:46.475Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T17:05:27.064Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T15:34:58.721Z","closed_by":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"labels":["devops::growth","group::acquisition","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"}],"author":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205206","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205206","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205206/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/205206/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#205206","relative":"#205206","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#205206"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30671472,"iid":205202,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate `review-build-cng` job taking longer than before","description":"## What is the productivity problem to solve?\n\nThe `review-build-cng` is taking more than 30 minutes.
