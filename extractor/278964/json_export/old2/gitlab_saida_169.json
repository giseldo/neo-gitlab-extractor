Live validation should be seen as assisting the user to input the correct information and not as a way of preventing them from submitting the form with possibly incorrect information (live validation might be frontend-only but the user has no way of knowing that).\n\nThe error message shows up below the input field in error state and should be helpful and contextual, not generic. If there’s Help text below the input field, an error pushes it further down as it needs to show up immediately after the input.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n### Design\n\nFrom our [specs](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/design-gitlab-specs/forms-spec-previews/):\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-10-09_at_11.12.01_AM](/uploads/f8d348cf09f9f0dc3bb529934b64ba00/Screen_Shot_2019-10-09_at_11.12.01_AM.png)\n\n* The errors should show up in an unordered list below in the input in `#DB3B21`\n* Input should be outlined in `#DB3B21`\n* After errors occur, they should be cleared when the user clears out the input tokens\n\n#### Example\n\n```\n* [Epic name] already has the maximum number of child epics\n* [Epic name] cannot be found\n```\n\n**Note:** We currently have an error appearing if you attach an epic/issue that already exists on the current epic.

Run the specific test with the `run-k6` command.  For example against the 10k environment you would run this following from the project root: `ACCESS_TOKEN=\"\" ./run-k6 -e environments/10k.json -s scenarios/60s_200rps.json -t tests/api/api_v4_projects_merge_requests_merge_request_discussions.js`, where `ACCESS_TOKEN` is a valid GitLab Personal Access Token for the specified environment(10k in this case).

If low number of failures, dig into some of the failures. See https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#helpful-options-for-install-upgrade-rollback for details about Helm waiting for readiness.\n     * Copy a release (ie review-create-ans-nn0xqi)\n     * Look at job output to see what Pods were available post timeout - `helm get values review-create-ans-nn0xqi | grep url` and click on job URL\n     * Look for pod list below `Error: release review-create-ans-nn0xqi failed: timed out waiting for the condition` to see what app wasn't ready or available.\n     * Run a describe for resources which were not available to look at events ie. `kubectl describe pod review-create-ans-nn0xqi-unicorn-7fbd495b7f-f9hpj`. The events can help provide a timeline of why a pod wasn't ready or available. You may see `FailedScheduling` or `Unhealthy` which can be used with the timeframe to determine when a pod was ready. \n\nThere are lots of ways to do these steps and improve them. @gl-quality/eng-prod - Let's iterate towards a better process. \n\n## Proposal\n\nI'd like to be able to iterative work towards answering the question of \"why are the releases failing\" and report across all failures. To do this, we need to work towards some sort of the following.\n\n- Identify which components/batch jobs are not ready when helm timeouts and iteratively solve this by:\n  - Step 1: Output this information to the console (in progress)\n  - Step 2: Identify relevant details in StackDriver from Pod events and Tiller logs for helm release upgrade failures.\n  - Step 3: Build notification around

Maybe move it to the finder? \n\n## Risks\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.\n--\u003e\n\n## Involved components\n\n`participants_service.rb`\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-20T11:45:53.781Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:57:35.869Z","closed_at":"2021-09-10T10:33:12.121Z","closed_by":{"id":438961,"username":"splattael","name":"Peter Leitzen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/97c2ff0fc99cc4eede69be9ac238c304?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/splattael"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","static code analysis","type::maintenance"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32409","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/32409","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/32409/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/32409/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#32409","relative":"#32409","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#32409"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25025762,"iid":32400,"project_id":278964,"title":"[FE] Implement a date picker for code hotspots","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently users cannot select a specific date for code hotspots, which means that they cannot drill down during a specific sprint since we only provide last 30 days periods\n\nParent issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/14971\n\n--------\n\nDifficult to provide an implementation plan as of yet due to code hotspots not yet existing","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-20T07:47:33.155Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T03:01:37.155Z","closed_at":"2021-02-16T03:01:36.996Z","closed_by":{"id":4583714,"username":"npost","name":"Nick Post","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4583714/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/npost"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Persona: Development Team Lead","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","component:date-picker","devops::manage","direction","frontend","group::optimize","maturity::minimal","pajamas::integrate","priority::2","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

But... The Geo secondary node not update the schema of the main db, that only happens when the Geo primary node performs the migrations **and** when those schema changes are replicated to the Geo secondary main db.\n\nTherefore, my theory:\n\n* The update on the Geo secondary happens\n* During that update, FDW is refreshed, but against the old main db schema\n* Later... the schema changes are replicated from the Geo primary to the Geo secondary node (because the Geo primary was updated later, or there is a large replication lag)\n* Geo secondary detects FDW mismatch :boom:\n\nSo although there might be a problem with conditions if the FDW refresh can run (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/3474#note_198478540), but there also might be an order-dependent problem.\n\nAnd you should keep in mind this thing called post-deployment migrations, so they run while the new version is already running (i.e. upgrade complete).\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFDW mismatch after completing an upgrade following all steps.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNo FDW mismatch after completing an upgrade following all steps.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fix: Modify upgrade instructions\n\nInstruct the sysadmin how to ensure post-migrations are finished *and replicated*, and only then run `rake geo:refresh_foreign_tables`.\n\nFollow up: Add a rake task or something to make it easier.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-20T00:19:40.471Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T08:09:20.399Z","closed_at":"2019-10-03T08:36:55.335Z","closed_by":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery

In particular, saw that the application settings store the following credentials in plaintext:\n\n* AWS keys for elastic search cluster  \n* Askimet API key  \n* reCAPTCHA site and private key  \n* Slack APP_SECRET\n\nFurthermore, these tokens are directly visible to any administrator and anyone looking at their computer. In general, it's good practice to redact entered tokens and do not show them in the user interface of GitLab.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTested on a local installation of GitLab Enterprise.\n\n1.

Display overarching statistics, such as number and percentage of traffic that has been blocked\n\n#### Next\n1. ~~Create a `Finding` object every time a piece of traffic is blocked due to a `NetworkPolicy` object restriction~~ (will be covered in its own issues, not this one)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\nPermissions should match those required by the Security Dashboard\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

Running `v12.2.5-ee` create a repo and invite the CODEOWNERS group to it under Settings / Members / Invite Group\n1. Create a CODEOWNERS file in the repo that contains `* @group-referenced-here` as a default global code owner\n1. Enable settings requiring code owner approval for merge under Settings / General / Merge Request Approval\n  1. Change the number of approvals required to 1\n  1. tick the box 'require approval from code owners' and save changes.\n1. Push a branch with committed code and start an MR\n1. Observe as it says two (2) members are required (when you only indicated one (1)\n1. Approve the request and see the UI show approval being satisfied but the merge button is greyed out.\n \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUnable to use CODEOWNERS feature \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThat one (1) of the members identified in the group for default code ownership is ALL that is required to approve the MR\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n![image](/uploads/1714d86aa1dbc4a3a48bcbc70e7efd8d/image.png)\n![Screen_Shot_2019-09-18_at_2.04.24_PM](/uploads/165fece5de5a60f2051f647a086503bf/Screen_Shot_2019-09-18_at_2.04.24_PM.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\n- In the following scenario:\n   - The “Eligible users” rule has a required number of approvals…\n   - AND there are other required approval rules OR Code Owner rules…\n- …we should discount the number of required approvals from the “Eligible users” rule.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n1. **Eligible users** rule requires `5` approvals, **UX** rule requires `1` approval, **BE** rule requires `1` approval: the summary should read `Requires 5 approvals from eligible users, UX, and BE.`\n   * Today this scenario **incorrectly** reads `Requires 7 more approvals from UX and BE.`\n1. **Eligible users** rule requires `1` approval, **UX** rule requires `1` approval, **BE** rule requires `1` approval: the summary should read `Requires 2 approvals from UX and BE.`\n   * Today this scenario **incorrectly** reads `Requires 3 more approvals from UX and BE.`\n1. **Eligible users** rule requires `0` approvals, **UX** rule requires `1` approval, **BE** rule requires `1` approval: the summary should read `Requires 2 approvals from UX and BE.`\n   * Today this scenario already reads `Requires 2 more approvals from UX and BE.`\n1. **Eligible users** rule requires `1` approval: `Requires 1 approval from eligible users.`\n   * Today this scenario reads `Requires approval.`\n\n### Actionable insight\n\nThis was also noted as an actionable insight from the [UX

The control gets the standard experience today where we do not display Security in the navigation.

Then we need to decide on how to monitor this, and ultimately implement the monitoring dashboards themselves. \n\n### Status\n\n#### Grafana: [Geo Primary insights](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/WO9bDCnmz/geo-primary-insights?orgId=1\u0026refresh=10s\u0026var-environment=gstg\u0026var-prometheus=prometheus-01-inf-gstg\u0026var-app_prometheus=prometheus-app-01-inf-gstg\u0026var-interval=1h)\n\nThis was originally build for the primary. During the GCP migration we had two separate Prometheus environments (Azure and GCP). There's not a lot there that's really useful to see what the status of Geo is.\n\nWhat we can change on this dashboard:\n\n- [x] Geo events: I'm seeing a total between 10k and 20k, but that does not represent in the sub-types of events. We should add all types and make sure they add up to the total. This might require a code change if we realize we not reporting all sub-types\n- [x] Repo verification: we have 154 verified repos and wikis. This does not match the number of \"checksummed\" repos the Geo admin panel is saying (3M+)\n- [x] We probably can delete all other graphs. They are irrelevant and also not showing anything at the moment\n\n#### Grafana: [Geo Secondary status](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/l8ifheiik/geo-status?orgId=1\u0026refresh=5m\u0026var-environment=gstg\u0026var-prometheus=prometheus-01-inf-gstg\u0026var-app_prometheus=prometheus-app-01-inf-gstg\u0026var-events_interval=1h)\n\nThis is mostly monitoring the secondary side of Geo operations.\n\n- [x] The graphs per type are looking mostly good. For uploads there are 48 failures, matching what the Geo admin panel says\n- [x] We might be missing graphs for design repos\n- [x] Also graphs for container registry is missing?\n- [x] DB replication lag is showing NaN. We should double check\n- [x] We're using deprecated single stat graphs. We should migrate them:\n   \u003eGauge visualizations within the Singlestat panel are deprecated. Please migrate this panel to use the Gauge panel.  \n   \u003eNOTE: Sparklines are not supported in the gauge panel \n- [x] There are some Sidekiq graphs which I don't think are relevant and we might want to delete.\n\n#### Alerts\n\nAs far as I know we don't have alerts set up for Geo on staging. Maybe it will be useful to have a least a few alerts:\n\n- [ ] When database replication lag is getting really high (this one might already exist, we should ask SREs)\n- [ ] When failures are getting too high\n\nI don't have any experience with Alert Manager. So I'm not sure what's needed to get this done.\n\n#### Sentry\n\n- [x] We need to make sure code exceptions are reported to Sentry. Also those happening on the secondary.\n\nLooking at https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/staginggitlabcom I don't see any errors from the secondary (did a search on `secondary`, didn't return anything). I guess the secondary is not [set up](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#error-reporting-and-logging-with-sentry) to report errors.\n\n#### Logs\n\n- [ ] Ideally we should be able to access the `geo.log` through https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net/\n\nI don't remember how we had this configured during the GCP migration. I think `geo.log` was aggregated into `pubsub-rails-inf-gstg` at the time, but I think it would be better to have a separate pubsub for that.\n\n### References\n\n- [Handbook - Monitoring of

Then `Modified` part should be split into Refactoring or Churn.\n\nEvery MR against the repo's default branch should have 3 new metrics according to lines it adds\\modifies\\removes:\n - new_loc\n - churned_loc\n - refactored_loc\n\n### Gitaly enhancements\n\n- Need to modify Gitaly to support `git diff --color-moved` in a way that the [ANSI color encoding is parsed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/snippets/1906828).  Purpose: Detect cut-and-paste line movements.\n- Need to modify Gitaly to support `git diff --word-diff` (we can modify/subclass `Gitlab::Diff::Parser` to [handle parsing it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/snippets/1907528)).  Purpose: Detect line modifications and whitespace changes.\n- Want to modify Gitaly to handle `git blame -L` with multiple `-L` options. Purpose: Improve performance; it's [about 3x faster](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/32225#note_232779481) than ordinary `git blame`.\n\nNote: Shelling out to `git diff` is currently possible, but not viable due to security, availability and versioning concerns.\n\n### Technical notes\n\n- For details on determining the \"default branch\", see `def default_branch?` in app/services/git/branch_push_service.rb.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-18T10:20:55.789Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T09:29:19.450Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T09:29:19.430Z","closed_by":{"id":4583714,"username":"npost","name":"Nick Post","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4583714/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/npost"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Manage [DEPRECATED]","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","analytics","backend","devops::manage","group::optimize","maturity::minimal","missed:12.4","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

You may do this using a variety of [package manager formats](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/), such as Maven or npm. If you are doing this as part of your CI workflow, you may publish many packages to your registry. When you publish a dependency, it generates several files including the package archive. \n\nThe problem is that GitLab doesn't provide a way to delete the files from a package, only the package itself. These extra files can clutter the user interface or worse result in someone installing an incorrect or outdated dependency. \n\nMoving forward, you can now use the [Packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html) to delete files related to a given package as well as the package itself.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWhen packages are published to the GitLab Package Registry, there are several files uploaded to the registry. The file type and the number of files vary based on format, when you upload a package to the registry, files are generally uploaded. \n\nThese files are displayed in the application when you view a package's details. The problem is that we do not currently provide a way to delete the files only the packages themselves. As a given package/version can have many files, it can result in confusion when downloading files, result in user error, or just clutter the user interface. \n\n### Proposal\n\nAs a Developer (or above), I'd like to be able to use the Packages API to delete specific files from a given package. This will be especially useful for removing branch-related packages uploaded to my registry during the build phase.\n\nFollowing the current [delete a package API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#delete-a-project-package), maybe implement something like:\n\n`DELETE /projects/:id/packages/:package_id/package_files/:package_file_id`\n\nWhich would mean adding new attributes for file type file name. \n\n### Documentation\n\nBy giving a way to delete package files, users can \"corrupt\" or \"damage\" a given package where an expected package file is missing. We will make it clear that this is the case in the Package ~documentation.\n\n### Measuring success\n\nAs a new feature, I'm most interested in adoption. So even a basic activity metric like the number of times it was used on GitLab.com would be helpful directionally.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-16T23:39:38.175Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T07:07:48.426Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T16:24:50.338Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P2","Stretch","api","backend","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","package:scaling","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32107","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/32107","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/32107/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/32107/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#32107","relative":"#32107","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#32107"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5152,"epic":{"id":177448,"iid":5152,"title":"Package Registry cleanup policies MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5152","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24851586,"iid":32102,"project_id":278964,"title":"Maven instance-wide endpoint returns 403 for anonymous access","description":"### Summary\n\nMaven instance-wide endpoint returns 403 for anonymous access\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

That's mainly a _presentation_ problem.\n\nWhat happens is that we build diff lines with a concatecation of `from_content` and `to_content`. Since the last line of `from_content` has no breakline, it breaks our diff lines builder for the suggestion.\n\n## Solution:\n\nInitial test change I made was:\n\n```patch\ndiff --git a/lib/gitlab/diff/suggestion_diff.rb b/lib/gitlab/diff/suggestion_diff.rb\nindex ee153c226b7..7f0a73b8edc 100644\n--- a/lib/gitlab/diff/suggestion_diff.rb\n+++ b/lib/gitlab/diff/suggestion_diff.rb\n@@ -18,7 +18,7 @@ module Gitlab\n       private\n\n       def raw_diff\n-        \"#{diff_header}\\n#{from_content_as_diff}#{to_content_as_diff}\"\n+        \"#{diff_header}\\n#{from_content_as_diff}\\n#{to_content_as_diff}\"\n       end\n\n       def diff_header\n```\n\nThough ideally we'll need to do the following when building the diff:\n\n1. Check if `from_content_as_diff` has a breakline, in that case, do nothing\n2. If the has no breakline, add it to the end of `from_content_as_diff`\n\nThis process will keep persistence untouched (which is correct), but fix the presentation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-16T16:46:07.912Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T16:48:29.775Z","closed_at":"2020-02-13T21:58:07.770Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas

at the conclusion stated at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/32749#note_216360352. The original state did not evaluate errors next to failures for xUnit results, when https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/25358 is closed it will, however, the copy inside of the merge request widget does not yet differentiate between those two types.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* QE / SDET\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n* When a test is ran that generates an error scenario like a test written incorrectly, I want to see that reported separate from tests that fail so that I debug the proper issue.\n** This is probably a scenario when new tests are introduced hastily and the issue is in the test not the code.\n* When a test is ran that fails, I want to see that reported separate from tests that error out, so that I can debug the proper issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nConvert copy `X failed/error test results out of X total tests` to `X failed, X errors out of X total tests`\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n* Update the [JUnit test report documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html) about the new / extra information provided.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThe first setting `Enabled Git access protocols` already exists in `Admin Area \u003e Settings \u003e General \u003e Visibility and access controls`. So I am proposing adding the thing below that. (As a text field, not number field though, that's a mistake in the screenshot.)\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/b0c6aff628dad415f2b7f79aa881561e/image.png)\n\nUsing the example clone panel from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/:\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/4d7a2464ae0faba7546e6c834b0a96e8/image.png)\n\nThe `Clone with HTTPS` link above is `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab.git`.\n\nIf you fill in the new setting as `gitlab.rocks.example.com`, then that link would change to `https://gitlab.rocks.example.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab.git`.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nTell sysadmins how to use these settings and what they do.\n\nTell them about these setting where relevant: At least https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/location_aware_git_url.html\n\nMention something about this caveat:\n\n\u003e If `gitlab_rails['gitlab_ssh_host']` is set, display a notice on the Settings UI saying the Omnibus setting is in use on this machine, and that it takes priority over \"Custom SSH clone root URL\" since it is more specific (per machine).\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.
