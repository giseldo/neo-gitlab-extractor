This behavior will change when we add edit capability to the form.\n    - [x] **Cancel** button: asks the user to confirm the action, then redirects back to the **On-demand Scans** landing page.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-30T17:28:28.170Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T07:08:48.865Z","closed_at":"2020-07-16T11:40:21.480Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["Category:DAST","Deliverable","devops::secure","direction","frontend","group::dynamic analysis","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"}],"author":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225370","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":7},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"7 of 7 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225370","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225370/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225370/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225370","relative":"#225370","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225370"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3772,"epic":{"id":75072,"iid":3772,"title":"DAST Site profiles - Form MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3772","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":52376966,"iid":225368,"project_id":278964,"title":"Instance level security dashboard has different size top nav buttons","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe top nav buttons in the security dashboard have different sizes. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

So after debug I had to disable LDAP to create DB then return it back.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. enable LDAP in `gitlab.yml`\n1. make sure you don't have database created in postgres\n1. run

Deployments a top level navigation element","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWith our progressive delivery functionality becoming more and more mature we notice a few patterns:\n- Feature Flags and future experiments such as A/B testing require a dedicated place to discuss intent, lifespan, and results (research insight will be added later)\n- The amount of people involved in the delivery of a feature is expanding beyond just engineering.\n- Delivery is the most critical part of feature development as it will make the feature user facing/noticeable on production.\n- A/B testing is seen as separate from FF (research insight will be added later)\n\nCurrently, we are looking for a place to put our experiments aside from feature flags. It will probably not make sense to have it hidden inside of one of the only-engineering focused menus.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

version in Go-based analyzers","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe GitLab Container Scanning tool currently outputs the latest version in the changelog when running a container scan:\n\n```\n[INFO] [klar] [2020-06-30T18:20:17+10:00] ▶ GitLab klar analyzer v2.4.7\n```\n\nBy outputting the information during a scan, it makes it much easier to determine the exact version of the analyzer, which is extremely useful for bug reports.\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to add the latest changelog version to the [app.Version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/733d29da8ec70823a4ec81d623218f58a60b6bd9/main.go#L23) field, and output this value for all Go-based analyzers.\n\nSee [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28566#note_320149905) for more details\n\n### Additional Details\n\nThe following provides some supporting evidence to illustrate why this change would be useful\n\n#### Example 1\n\nWhile investigating the [following issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208085#note_374060843), the end-user provided the output log from the failing container scanning job, which included the semantic version of the analyzer `v2.4.8`, but _did not_ include the SHA of the docker image of the analyzer, which would have required additional back and forth to request that this information be included in the output log.\n\n#### Example 2\n\nIn [the following `tests/js-yarn` job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-yarn/-/jobs/620623531), it's not possible to know exactly which version of the underlying [`retire.js` analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js) is used because the image SHA of the `retire.js` analyzer is not output:\n\n```\nUnable to find image

value and output it in the [`retire.js` analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js), then we can see exactly what version is being used, as shown in the [following

it more obvious which version a customer is using when submitting a bug report.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. [x] Update the [build stage of analyzer.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/07c90cb890328b5df68cf8ef1c684ffb2fb1fd42/includes-dev/analyzer.yml#L58-67) to extract the latest version from the `CHANGELOG.md` file and pass it as an argument to the `ldflags` parameter when building the `analyzer` binary:\n\n   ```sh\n    - CHANGELOG_VERSION=$(grep -m 1 '^## v.*$' \"CHANGELOG.md\" | sed 's/## v//')\n    - PATH_TO_MODULE=`go list -m`\n    - go build -ldflags=\"-X '$PATH_TO_MODULE/metadata.AnalyzerVersion=$CHANGELOG_VERSION'\" -o ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/analyzer\n   ```\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/165\n\n1. [x] Add the above logic to the `Dockerfile` for each analyzer that uses a separate binary build stage\n\n      - [x] [klar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/blob/d281fc9/Dockerfile#L29-34)\n         -

Abrupt credential revocation is disruptive and frustrating, but an organization unable to rotate credentials for their users faces an increased risk of a credential's compromise.\n\nThere's no way to delete SSH credentials on behalf of `users` for `administrators` and `group owners`, who need to enforce this action.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis was split out from #214811 per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214811#note_369945751.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### Solution\n\nIn the \"SSH\" tab of the [credentials inventory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36742), add a `Delete` button that appears for each SSH credential.

Confirming via the modal causes the SSH credential to be deleted.\n\n![SSH](/uploads/795a7205e0b99b95b3a1f681e6768fbf/SSH.png)\n\n### Implementation breakdown\n\n* Add or modify the path to delete SSH keys for `admin/credentials` \u0026 `groups` in the ~backend\n* Add an additional column with the `Delete` button\n\n### Follow-up\n\n* Improve the confirmation modal https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235945","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-29T19:54:58.358Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:21:09.356Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T10:53:54.904Z","closed_by":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","UX","devops::manage","direction","frontend","group::compliance","priority::1","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225248","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225248","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225248/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225248/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225248","relative":"#225248","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225248"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3084,"epic":{"id":42150,"iid":3084,"title":"Improve PAT \u0026 SSH credential inventory \u0026 management","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3084","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":51655779,"iid":225242,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use pointer:crosshair when hovering on the design view","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

iteration, the SAST Configuration UI will only expose text fields for configurable variables.\n\nA [container component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231370) will consume the component created in _this_ issue, and create an instance of it for each occurrence of a [SAST configuration entity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.2.0-rc44-ee/app/graphql/types/ci_configuration/sast/entity_type.rb) with type `string` yielded by the GraphQL query for [`sastCiConfiguration`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.2.0-rc44-ee/doc/api/graphql/reference/gitlab_schema.graphql#L9882-9885) (See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231372).\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Add input sizing to GitLab UI\n    - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1604\n- [x] Add GlFormText to GitLab UI\n    - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1605\n- [ ] Implement form input component\n    - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37812\n    - Props will likely match fields of the [SAST configuration entity type](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.2.0-rc44-ee/app/graphql/types/ci_configuration/sast/entity_type.rb), excluding `options`, which isn't relevant for `text`/`string` configuration entities.\n    - The `description` field will be rendered via the `label` slot on the existing `GlFormInput` component.\n    - Standard `v-model` bindings: `{ prop: 'value', event: 'input' }`.\n    - Event payload should be new `value`\n    - Parent dynamic form container component would be responsible for feeding this event payload into some larger data structure, suitable for form submission\n    - Must have \"Restore default\" functionality as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228830#design-proposal-configuration-ui-with-dynamic-restore-to-default-link. This can use the `helpText` prop on existing `GlFormInput` component.\n    - See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216635#note_371938012 for a discussion about description/help text positioning.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-29T17:26:42.030Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T11:47:45.817Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T11:47:45.784Z","closed_by":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Deliverable","devops::secure","frontend","group::static analysis","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"}],"author":{"id":5412787,"username":"nmccorrison","name":"Neil McCorrison","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5412787/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmccorrison"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225224","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":2},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225224","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225224/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225224/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225224","relative":"#225224","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225224"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3659,"epic":{"id":70931,"iid":3659,"title":"SAST Config UI Page - Basic SAST Wide Settings","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3659","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":51572497,"iid":225222,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project Level Access Tokens and TOS","description":"Project-level access tokens should be able to be used without the Bot User having to accept TOS.\n\nWhen trying to use the project level access token you get the error below:\n\n\u003e GitlabGetError: 403: 403 Forbidden - You (@project_64_bot1) must accept the Terms of Service in order to perform this action.

We need to expand support for ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\" in order to support these languages.\n\nThis must work with offline.\n\nPlease see: [Engineering research - Decide next language to add to Dependency Scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217024)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nno change, identical to other supported managers\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add NuGet as a supported package manager, and scan `packages.lock.json`. This file is generated by NuGet when [lock files are enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#enabling-lock-file).\n* Add metrics if needed (if https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229617 finished you may need to, if it is not yet finished make sure https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229617 includes NuGet)\n* In parallel, request NuGet vulnerabilities be ingested\n* Update user documentation when both scanner is available and security advisories are ingested\n\n### Further details\n\nNuGet lock files `packages.lock.json` can be supported in Gemnasium. Users need to configure their .NET project to [enable lock files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#enabling-lock-file), and add `packages.lock.json` to their repo. This feature is available [with NuGet 4.9 or above and with Visual Studio 2017 15.9 or above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#enabling-lock-file).\n\nNuGet uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning#semantic-versioning-200), and a Maven-like syntax for [version ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning#version-ranges). All that could be supported in the Gemnasium vrange library since we already have SemVer support and Maven support. We might have to implement a new vrange plugin that combines SemVer versions with Maven version ranges though. We might be able to implement that in Go, in `gemnasium/semver`.\n\nDependency file support (as opposed to lock file) could later be implemented by running `nuget` to generate the lock file before parsing it. This lock file parsers would be reused.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nAdd advisories to the vulnerability database:\n- [x] provide information about new package type https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/-/issues/137\n- [x] start ingest advisories https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201781\n\nPrepare test project and CI template:\n\n- [x] open a MR that updates the [CI templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) so that the `rules:exists` of the scanning job match the supported dependency file https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37553\n- [x] set up a [test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests) that features the dependency file https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/csharp-nuget-dotnetcore/-/merge_requests/19\n\nUpdate analyzer https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/87\n\n- [x] declare [package type](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.12.0/scanner/parser/parser.go#L14) as a Go const\n- [x] implement lock file [parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.12.0/scanner/parser); it's registered with the new package type, and the dependency files it supports\n- [x] implement [vrange](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.12.0/vrange) resolver, to match the affected range with the dependency version\n- [x] [register](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.12.0/main.go#L232) the version range resolver with the package type\n- [x] add a downstream pipeline to the [CI config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.12.0/.gitlab-ci.yml#L10), to use the test project for QA\n- [x] release a new version https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/releases/v2.13.0\n\nAlso update the Rails ~frontend:\n- [ ] present the `nuget` package type as `C# (NuGet)` in the dependency list https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38892\n\nMerge CI template, update doc, clean up test project:\n\n- [x] submit the changes to the [CI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) !37553 \n- [x] make the test project use the `master` of the CI template https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/csharp-nuget-dotnetcore/-/merge_requests/20\n- [x] add the package manager to the [supported languages and package managers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#supported-languages-and-package-managers) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37609\n\nAs a side task, it would be useful to improve **developer docs**.\n\n- [x] document the steps involved in supporting a new package manager in [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/94\n- [-] turn this issue into an issue template, to be added to the [Secure section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure) of the handbook\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThere should be no changes to ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\" permissions.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThis should work as documented for the other ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\" supported languages and frameworks\n\nPlease add this to the [supported languages and frameworks table](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers), be explicit about versions and lock files\n\nPlease add any variables, notes or warnings that are needed for this into the user documentation. For example what type of lock files are expected or looked at and links to places where they can see how they turn on their lock files (external docs)\n\nPlease link to the feedback issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227875 to allow people to request other versions.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nYou must have a test project, and basic tests, specific to making sure NuGet is supported that will run each release to ensure nothing breaks (if a parameter is changed and is not backwards compatible)\n\nThis must be incorporated into both online and offline test suites. Work with ~Quality to accomplish, they will setup what to mimic, and you will implement based on the pattern.\n\nThe test project should also be documented in the list of test projects quality is maintaining.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers with NuGet projects get Dependency Scanning reports. They can see the dependencies of their NuGet projects in the Dependency List, and are notified about vulnerabilities affecting these dependencies.\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217024","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-29T16:30:03.735Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T07:34:11.617Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T06:21:32.215Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["AST Leadership","Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","direction","group::composition analysis","quad-planning::complete-action","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":3913516,"username":"NicoleSchwartz","name":"Nicole Schwartz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3913516/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NicoleSchwartz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225219","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":15,"completed_count":14},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"14 of 15 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225219","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225219/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225219/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225219","relative":"#225219","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225219"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2550,"epic":{"id":18820,"iid":2550,"title":"Add support of .NET Core or C# or Framework in Dependency Scanning","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2550","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":51560715,"iid":225218,"project_id":278964,"title":"Dependency Scanning Conan support using conan.lock behind feature flag or not announced until vulnerability DB has content","description":"NOTE if you are a user who also would like to see this feature, please UPVOTE 👍 it and comment to help it get prioritized (So it’s raised as part of our [sensing mechanisms]( https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-management/process/#sensing-mechanism)\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nC / C++ are both in the top 10 languages used at GitLab, GitHub, and have been requested by our potential and current users.

User experience goal\n\nUpdate the Meta headers on the Advanced Global Search Result page to give a better description when links are posted in Apps like slack. \n\n### Further details\n\nhttps://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254\n\nThis would Ideally not exceed the \"classic Link Unfurling\". \nhttps://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/link-unfurling#classic_unfurl\n\nThis will probably only work if the page is public. \n\nNeed to confirm our rules for Bots will allow it.

Things can be worse if we use the `expanded` version of the serializer, where for each downstream pipeline we fetch their own upstream/downstream pipelines.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Solution\n\n- preload properly data used to serialize [`triggered_by_pipeline` and `triggered_pipelines`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c6ff21196da73236e646f7c511bd69ed8cd5d3b8/app/serializers/pipeline_serializer.rb#L64-65).\n- ensure that with [`expanded` serializer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c6ff21196da73236e646f7c511bd69ed8cd5d3b8/app/serializers/triggered_pipeline_entity.rb#L32-38) we can still reduce the number of queries being fired.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-29T08:09:43.410Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T10:10:26.570Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T18:58:24.404Z","closed_by":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","Deliverable","backend","bridge pipelines","bug::performance","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","maintenance::refactor","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"}],"author":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225156","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225156","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225156/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225156/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225156","relative":"#225156","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225156"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":51308173,"iid":225155,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove pipeline_id ignore rule from requirement's test_reports","description":"In second step we dropped the column -

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage_data.rb#L134\n\nMy (@dennis) suggestion would be to add an additional usage metric, e.g., `projects_imported: count(Project.where.not(import_type: nil))`.\n\nFrom that point we can create a Sisense dashboard to compare `projects_imported` against total `projects`.\n\n## Definition of done\n\n- We are able to

The file contains many examples on how to create a toggle. Follow the same conventions. We'll need to collaborate with the ~backend here because we still need a setting name which they'll provide. This is the BE issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290112 \n- [ ] ~frontend Once the toggle setting is ready, I think we need to update `ee/app/views/layouts/nav/sidebar/_project_security_link.html.haml` to render dynamically the `Security \u0026 Compliance` nav item. As an example, you can check `app/views/layouts/nav/sidebar/_project.html.haml:82`. I believe that displays the issue tab only if it's enabled.
