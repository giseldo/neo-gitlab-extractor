There may be more such cases.\n\n####  Impact\n\nPrivate Projects' Jobs/Pipelines/namespace etc are leaked to Specific Runner Jobs API endpoint due to missing access control on the endpoint   `/runners/:id/jobs`\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\n1. `UserA` creates `ProjectA` and adds `UserB` as maintainer  \n2. `UserA` creates a specific `runnerA` for `ProjectA` and  allows it to be assigned to other projects  \n3. `UserB` creates a public project and  enables `runnerA` on it\n4. `UserB` is removed from `ProjectA`   \nTHE ISSUE:\n5. `UserB` can access current and future private projects from the endpoint `/runners/:id/jobs` because they are still considered owner of `runnerA`","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-03T00:12:16.072Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T15:14:58.261Z","closed_at":"2022-06-30T11:06:35.296Z","closed_by":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura

cleanup: Adding an alert integration","description":"## Summary\n\nWhile we work to add custom mappings for HTTP alert integrations https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4390, we are (obviously) adding more complexity to the form for adding integrations. \n\nOver the course of enabling multiple HTTP integrations for ~\"GitLab Premium\"+, we made a few concessions in UX to accommodate technical needs. With custom mappings, we're making a few more. \n\nNotable issues:\n| Area | Issue | Solution overview |\n| ------| ------ | ------ |\n| Error\u0026nbsp;handling | A ‚Äúcan‚Äôt add integration‚Äù message doesn‚Äôt really tell users why things have failed or how to fix them | Improve error messaging so it's more descriptive - explain what the failure was (if possible) |\n| Error handling | We‚Äôre using alerts for things like ‚Äúname can‚Äôt be blank‚Äù rather than form validations (which appear directly under the fields that have the errors) | Update alert text: \"There are errors that need to be corrected in the form,\" and add in form field validation under the required fields: \"Name field can't be blank,\" etc. Do not collapse form if there is a failure |\n| Initial setup | It‚Äôs unclear that the token \u0026 url for a new integration aren‚Äôt available until the integration has been saved for the first time | Update intro text and hide the URL/auth key fields as they aren't available [(design shown below)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/66afbfaab8e623a01389b6f5763cd2c8/Frame_94.png). Include a [button](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/3a7ae3697f22f48472501708f20885a0/Form_saved.png) for accessing the webhook/URL after successfully saved and form has collapsed that links directly to the view credentials section. |\n| Initial setup | It's unclear that a user on ~\"GitLab Premium\" may choose to opt _out_ of using custom mappings by leaving the mappings blank | [Update intro text to custom mapping section; details shown below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/66afbfaab8e623a01389b6f5763cd2c8/Frame_94.png) |\n| Initial setup | The 'sample payload' field is not optional for custom mappings, but the title indicates it is | Update section intro text [as shown below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/66afbfaab8e623a01389b6f5763cd2c8/Frame_94.png) |\n| Test alert | Disabling the sample payload fields for custom mappings makes it difficult/weird to trigger a test alert with a secondary payload. It means the user must accept the ‚Äúmappings are about to break‚Äù message before they can do so. | Separate out the test alert functionality into a separate tab; Only disable the sample payload field on the custom mapping form/show the warning message if a payload has already been submitted |\n| Test alert | The sample payload field is disabled, even if the user intends to use the built-in gitlab alert mappings (rather than the custom mappings). |Separate out the test alert functionality into a separate tab; Only disable the sample payload field on the custom mapping form/show the warning message if a payload has already been submitted |\n| Test alert | The sample payload mapping is disabled before a user ever enters content into it (even with an integration toggled to ‚Äòactive‚Äô) | Should only be disabled if content had been entered into it and saved previously  |\n| Re-attempts | When an integration has failure for whatever reason, the menu still closes while using the 'Save Integration' button | Section should not collapse when there is a failure |\n| Re-attempts | Sometimes values in the form carry over from a previous attempt at editing the form; sometimes they disappear between attempts | Previously entered values should remain |\n\n## Solution details\n\n### List View\n\n![list view with 2ndary confirm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/9e6408d5c92159583ee207263e96da20/List_view_with_new_integration_button_confirm-2nd___lowercase_prometheus.png)\n\nChanges:\n\n* Hide 'Add new integrations' form by default\n* Introduce 'Add new integration button'\n* Display `PROMETHEUS` type as `Prometheus`\n* Change `pencil` icon to `settings` icon\n* Settings icon should open 'Configure details'\n\n### Integration tabs view\n\nHigh-level: We replace the Add/Edit view with 3 justified tabs: 'Configure details,' 'View credentials,' and 'Send test alert.' 'Configure details' takes the bulk of the existing Add/Edit functionality, but the credentials and test alerts are off-loaded to their own sections of the UI.\n\nClicking on a tab should switch visible content for that integration. Content in the fields should be preserved when switching between tabs. For example, unsaved changes made in the 'Configure details' should still be visible if the user navigates to the 'Test alert' tab, then back to the 'Configure details' tab.\n\n#### Configure details\n|  | HTTP Core | HTTP Premium | Prometheus |\n|--|-----------|--------------|------------|\n| Add | ![Frame_93](/uploads/a3ec102ac5370403a15ae3c838a68b1e/Frame_93.png) | ![Frame_94](/uploads/66afbfaab8e623a01389b6f5763cd2c8/Frame_94.png)| ![Frame_95](/uploads/9dd711ec09e343fa324206edf41569e5/Frame_95.png)|\n| Edit | ![Frame_96](/uploads/12ffb8066462b650bc95a332a781d9e1/Frame_96.png) | ![Frame_97](/uploads/9bcda459aa9bc5ff6e59f2cbcf97c404/Frame_97.png) | ![Frame_98](/uploads/72b19ae3e3bb2d00ce3f2d81b9666f3b/Frame_98.png) |\n\nChanges:\n\n* Remove form title ('Add new integrations')\n* URL/token fields are removed\n* Introduce field validation for required fields, and improve the general error messaging (right now, the error just says, \"Failed to save the integration.\")\n* 'Cancel' button is renamed 'Cancel and close'\n* 'Cancel and close' button discards changes and closes the form, revealing the 'Add new integration' button\n* 'Save and test payload' button is removed\n* Hide title field on the Prometheus form\n* 'Save integration' button should be `btn-confirm` instead of `btn-success`\n* On successful save, add a link to the 'Configure details' tab for the integration to the success alert (design shown in the top portion of [this image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/3a7ae3697f22f48472501708f20885a0/Form_saved.png))\n  * Because the page has a table and a static URL, any anchor tag will not be tied to the particular integration, but is tied instead to the spot on the page for any integration which is currently open. If no integration is open, the anchor tag will not be tied to anything. This is the case for either the tab view or the the original form. So if the user copies the link from the button, it will not necessarily lead to the right place if they try to share it with other people or use it later.\n  * We're ok if the link/anchor just leads to the correct section while the current page is open \u0026 isn't shareable with other users. Credentials aren't needed often and don't necessarily need to be shared. We can look at LOE of making this link shareable as part of implementation.\n* Section should not collapse when there is a failure; previously entered values should remain\n* \\[Core\\] Sample payload field is removed\n\n##### Add-view-only changes\n\n* Disable 'View credentials' and 'Send test alert' tabs\n* On successful save, navigate the user directly to the 'View credentials' tab\n* 'Submit payload' button for sample payload is replaced with text 'Parse payload for custom mapping'\n\n##### Edit-view-only changes\n\n* Hide the 'Select integration type' field\n* Disable 'Save integration' button until user as modified a field on the page\n* Allow the payload field to be editable by default providing no payload as previously been saved. (It's currently disabled.)\n* On successful save, close the form so 'Add new integration' button is visible again\n* \\[Prometheus\\] Hide the 'Name integration' field\n\n#### Credentials view\n\n![Frame_99](/uploads/c4728d505238341884bb8234b99b6f49/Frame_99.png)\n\nChanges:\n\n* URL/token fields should be added to this view\n* 'Reset token' button should be main action on the tab (Danger button)\n* After a user resets the token, leave the form open\n* 'Close' button should be added which closes the form and makes the 'Add new integration' button visible again\n\n#### Test alert view\n\n![list view with 2ndary confirm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/441a2553979c75714ca8d31fb836e1df/Test_alert.png)\n\nChanges:\n\n* Payload field should be added\n* Include text at the top of the tab explaining that test alerts can only be sent to active integrations.\n* 'Discard and close' button should be added. This will clear the field and close the form, allowing the 'Add new integration' button to be visible again\n* 'Send' should be the main action on the tab.\n  * Clicking 'Send' should use the provided input as the payload for a test alert.\n  * Clicking 'Send' should NOT save the integration. The integration will have credentials already available.\n  * After clicking 'Send' the form should stay open.\n* If a user clicks 'Send' while there are unsaved changes in the 'Configure details' tab, pop up an alert.\n  * Pop-up should provide two options: 'Save integration \u0026 send' || 'Proceed without saving integration'\n  * If user proceeds without saving, changes made in the 'Configures details' section will still be preserved.\n* In the \"successful test alert has been sent\" message, add a `View your test alert` link that will open up the alert list page in a new tab.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-02T20:34:09.438Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T04:01:47.269Z","closed_at":"2021-04-02T13:34:14.977Z","closed_by":{"id":4339707,"username":"ohoral","name":"Olena Horal-Koretska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42796a7332b4608eb9785986719e7215?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ohoral"},"labels":["Deliverable","SUS::FY22 Q1 - Incomplete","devops::monitor","group::respond","maintenance::refactor","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},{"id":4339707,"username":"ohoral","name":"Olena Horal-Koretska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42796a7332b4608eb9785986719e7215?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ohoral"}],"author":{"id":3163848,"username":"syasonik","name":"Sarah Yasonik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3163848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/syasonik"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":58,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300827","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300827","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300827/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300827/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300827","relative":"#300827","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300827"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78303274,"iid":300809,"project_id":278964,"title":"Turn on feature flag for Subscription Expiration banner","description":"# UPDATE\n\nThe ff has been disabled and this issue will be repurposed to track re-enabling the ff once the fixes for the known issues are resolved.

Vuex version is no longer in development and all active work is being done on the GraphQL version. As such, we are replacing the Vuex version with the GraphQL version in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300753. This temporary feature flag is so that we can develop the feature in pieces and test it on live before enabling it for all users.\n\n## Owners\n\n* Team: Threat Insights\n* Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_secure_threat_insights`\n* Best individual to reach out to: @dftian\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe pipeline security tab will show the newer GraphQL vulnerability list instead of the older Vuex version.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe pipeline security tab will not show any vulnerabilities.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nN/A\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- TBD\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set pipeline_security_dashboard_graphql true --staging`)\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab pipeline_security_dashboard_graphql true`)\n- [ ] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set pipeline_security_dashboard_graphql true`)\n- [ ] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab pipeline_security_dashboard_graphql false\n```\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] ~frontend `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/pipeline_security_dashboard.vue` is responsible for mounting the dashboard. We can follow the same pattern that we did in other security dashboards and create a `pipeline_security_dashboard_vulnerabilities.vue` file which will be responsible for loading the vulnerabilities and displaying them through the `vulnerability_list.vue` component. An example is the `first_class_group_security_dashboard`. **Make sure to develop this behind the feature flag**\n- [ ] ~frontend Add specs\n- [ ] ~frontend Update documentation","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-02T10:23:16.438Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:00:44.799Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T09:47:41.513Z","closed_by":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","devops::secure","feature flag","frontend","group::threat insights","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"}],"author":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300756","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":15,"completed_count":2},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 15 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300756","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300756/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300756/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300756","relative":"#300756","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300756"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4969,"epic":{"id":148197,"iid":4969,"title":"Convert the pipeline security tab to use GraphQL \u0026 shared UI components","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4969","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78266454,"iid":300755,"project_id":278964,"title":"[FE] Use vulnerability details component for pipeline security tab vulnerabilities modal","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nPreviously, the pipeline security tab used a Vuex version of the vulnerability list.

Typically, one production environment exists per project. This identification is crucial in our features, for example, our [DORA 4 metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) features explicitly target the production environment for data collection.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, please see the following examples.\n\nWhen user defines a deployment job to a production environment, they script in .gitlab-ci.yml like:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy-to-production:\n  script: echo 'Deploy to production'\n  environment: production\n```\n\nThis gives us an assumption that all production environments are defined with `environment: production` (or `environment:name: production`), however, if the name of their production environment is something else, such as \"gprd\" or \"customer-portal\", the definition doesn't align with the assumption:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy-to-production:\n  script: echo 'Deploy to production'\n  environment: gprd\n```\n\nThe main problem on the current syntax is that the actual meaning of `environment:name:` differs per usecase:\n\n1. It's a label/codename for the application on the environment.\n1. It's a identifier for the production environment.\n\nTo align the system level expectation and end-user's level expectation for the \"production\" environment, we should provide an explicit identifier that which environment is \"production\".\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe introduce a new keyword `environment:deployment_tier:` in .gitlab-ci.yml.\n\n- `environment:name: \u003cname\u003e` (or `environment: \u003cname\u003e`) ... This is the label/codename for the application on the enviornment.\n- `environment:deployment_tier: \u003cname\u003e`    ...  This is the identifier that the environment is either `production`, `staging`, `testing`, `development` or `other`. \n\n```yaml\ndeploy-to-production:\n  script: echo 'Deploy to production'\n  environment:\n    name: gprd\n    deployment_tier: production \n```\n\nIf `environment:deployment_tier:` is not explicitly specified, GitLab automatically _guesses_ the type from `environment:name:`. For example, `environment: production` will automatically set the type as `production`, however, `environment: customer-portal` will be `other`. So it's not 100% accurate.\n\nFYI, this is same type structure with [Jira's Environment Data model](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-deployments-0-1-bulk-post).\n\nThe terminology `deployment_tier` was suggested by @ogolowinski.\n\n### UX\n\nWe show the deployment_tier on environment index page. (Maybe next iteration)\n\n## Further iteration\n\nThis feature will enhance the design of [Group-Level Protected environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888). Sometimes, the definition of production environment (`environment:name:`) differs per project, so that hard to protect the production environments by its `name`. With this `type`, users can rule it by types. For example,:\n\n- At group-level, operators create a protected environment rule:\n  - `production` and `staging` deployment_tiers of environments can be created/modified by operator group.\n  - `testing` and `development` deployment_tier of environments can be created/modified by anyone (e.g. operators and developers).\n  - NOTE: This automatically disables all subsequent group/project-level protected environment rules.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-02T06:42:22.933Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T08:47:27.559Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T22:22:36.033Z","closed_by":{"id":5622641,"username":"nicolewilliams","name":"Nicole Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5622641/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolewilliams"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","Category:Release Orchestration","Deliverable","Release::P1","cicd::active","devops::release","environments","group::release","release post item::in review","section::ops","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":52,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300741","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300741","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300741/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300741/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300741","relative":"#300741","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300741"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78253918,"iid":300740,"project_id":278964,"title":"New DAST site profile do not have same validation status","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen a new site profile is created, it doesn't have any validation status.

was setting up a vulnerable project for testing purposes, and while enabling security features found myself very overwhelmed by our configuration table. There's so much text, some features have different items in shared columns, and the buttons have different labels. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Remove status column and use icons + tooltips \n- Remove DAST profiles from this page. All the other items are secure features/scanners and this one seems out of place. Users can get to profiles from the `On-demand` screen\n- Remove `View history`. Is this really important? The workaround would be to manually find the file history yourself, or we could add a link in the configuration page itself\n- Change all button labels to either `Configure` or `Enable`\n- Remove table headers.

techical debt in sidebar.vue","description":"Resolve technical debt in `app/assets/javascripts/jobs/components/sidebar.vue`\n\n- Avoid addition assignment operator on `retryButtonClass` computed prop. We could use template literal for prop value and just return if we want it to be a primary or inverted secondary button. \n- `hasArtifact` is checking if an artifact is present based on the object being empty. This is wrong since `locked` property will be present always it seems. So the `v-if` statement will never work for the `artifacts` block. We need a different method of checking.\n- Looks as the `trigger` property on the job is not present if no trigger is defined on the job. `hasTriggers` could possibly be refactored to be more accurate representation of the data `this.job?.trigger`\n- Could `stages` state be used for `hasStages` computed prop? It looks like no `stages` property is present on the job's pipeline. I wonder if this is an improper implementation, will need further investigation.\n- If the `commit` computed property is every `undefined` we return an empty object. Downstream this will break the `commit` block component since it's trying to access `commit.id` etc. in the component. \n- Let's use gitlab utility classes in this component \n- Let's use a `data-testid` instead of `js-sidebar-build-toggle`\n- Instead of using button classes on the `GlLink` components let's use `GlButton` component with `href` prop.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-01T16:35:10.046Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T15:59:12.521Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T15:59:12.452Z","closed_by":{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","maintenance::refactor","priority::3","section::ops","workflow::verification"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"}],"author":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300668","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300668","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300668/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300668/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300668","relative":"#300668","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300668"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78217909,"iid":300659,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor project reference sidebar component to use Vue + Apollo","description":"Currently, issue sidebar `Project reference` component is implemented with HAML and jQuery.

The template has lots of helpful tips and hints commented out in yaml to make customization of the template easier and explain the syntax in the context of the syntax as much as possible.\n\n\n### Problem\n\nCI 1st time experience provides no guidance on what is GitLab CI, how it works and how to set it up. A blank file is intimidating for those who don't know how CI works and how to write the yaml configuration. Most 1st time users find the experience for setting up CI difficult, which is slowing down CI adoption\n\n\n### Proposal\nLet's pre-populate the editor so instead of an empty blank page users would see the following template\n\n\n\n```yaml\n# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without\n# any modifications. It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline.\n# Instead of real tests or scripts, it uses echo commands to simulate\n# the pipeline execution.\n#\n# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.\n# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.\n#\n# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages\n\nstages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution\n  - build\n  - test\n  - deploy\n\nbuild-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo \"Compiling the code...\"\n    - echo \"Compile complete.\n\nunit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.\n  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.\n  script:\n    - echo \"Running unit tests...\"\n    - echo \"Code coverage is 90%\"\n\nlint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.\n  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).\n  script:\n    - echo \"Linting code...\"\n    - echo \"No lint issues found.\"\n\ndeploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.\n  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.\n  script:\n    - echo \"Deploying application...\"\n    - echo \"Application successfully deployed.\"\n\n```\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-31T08:49:57.504Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T19:21:18.253Z","closed_at":"2021-06-11T13:09:49.222Z","closed_by":{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","FY22::Q2","Low SUS Score","Technical Writing","candidate::14.0","ci::templates","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","release post item::in review","section::ops","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"}],"author":{"id":4509877,"username":"dhershkovitch","name":"Dov Hershkovitch","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7daa3113f0359f08a217fa800d9cc1d2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dhershkovitch"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"},"user_notes_count":38,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300501","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300501","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300501/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300501/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300501","relative":"#300501","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300501"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4499,"epic":{"id":117846,"iid":4499,"title":"Visual Builder for Pipeline Editor","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4499","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":78096692,"iid":300474,"project_id":278964,"title":"Re-structure analytics definitions into a table format","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe [Analytics definitions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics) introduced to the documentation in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52704 are in a simple bulleted list format.

to allow \"Pipelines must succeed\" to merge for empty pipelines","description":"### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nTBD\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n**NOTE**: In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321267 we implemented feature to solve the following problem and this issue is the follow-up to add ability to configure this setting in the UI.\n\nA merge request cannot be merge under the following conditions:\n- `Pipeline must succeed` is enable in project settings\n- Changes in the MR are such that CI config evaluates to all jobs being skipped, so no pipeline manifests\n- Absence of a pipeline fails the condition that \"pipeline must succeed\" to allow merge according to the project settings\n\nNote: CI configs using `job:rules` can evaluate to skip all jobs; and `workflow:rules` can evaluate to skip entire pipeline.\n\n### Proposal \n\n_**NOTE**: This proposal depends on a new `preparing` state to be added to `MergeRequest#merge_status` state machine in issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/291012._\n\nAdd a new option at the project Settings \u003e General \u003e Merge requests (expanded) \u003e Merge checks (section):\n- New checkbox for `Require pipeline to be present` is added indented directly below the existing `Pipelines must succeed` option. (see screenshot below for visualization of location)\n- This new checkbox is disabled by default.\n- This new checkbox is enabled (but unchecked) when `Pipelines must succeed` checkbox is selected/checked.\n- When this new is selected/checked, then the Merge button is enabled when:\n   - merge request is **not** in `preparing` state; and\n   - merge request has an empty or no pipeline (because evaluation of CI config results in skipping all jobs)\n\n| Screenshot of existing options | \n| ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2021-02-11_at_8.18.26_AM](/uploads/17935c3b8cde885adb6701fa0af14bc8/Screen_Shot_2021-02-11_at_8.18.26_AM.png)|\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary markdown=\"span\"\u003eORIGINAL PROPOSAL, click to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nWe have a highly optimized pipeline which runs only when relevant files changed. For some files in our repository, there is simply no CI job to be run. So no pipeline runs (it is empty). If we enable \"Pipelines must succeed\" setting then this prevents us from making MRs for those files which have no related CI jobs. On the other hand, we do want to require pipelines to succeed when there is a pipeline.\n\nSo I would ask that a sub-setting is added to \"Pipelines must succeed\" which would allow merging for empty pipelines.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Workaround\n\nBecause the application currently does not persist a pipeline that is empty, the CI mergeability checks for \"Pipeline must succeed\" fails because a pipeline does not exist. Therefore, a workaround would be to include a job that is always created and succeeds to circumvent empty (non-existent) pipeline. An example would be to configure a job that runs only when CI configs evaluate to skip all other jobs.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-29T20:46:01.426Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T16:46:06.062Z","closed_at":"2021-06-22T17:29:04.403Z","closed_by":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie Porter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4905402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jreporter"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","UX","Verify candidate","Verify::P2","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","customer","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","merge requests","onboarding","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":706613,"username":"mitar","name":"Mitar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/706613/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mitar"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":45,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300471","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300471","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300471/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300471/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334281"},"references":{"short":"#300471","relative":"#300471","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300471"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5455,"epic":{"id":212466,"iid":5455,"title":"Bugs: MR Mergeability","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5455","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78092851,"iid":300462,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix instances of \"monthy\"","description":"While working on spelling issues in the documentation, I ran across the spelling `monthy`.

During the process of [working with a customer](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/184895)(internal only), and through my own local testing, both categories of user appear to be counting as billable users via the UI and historical data worker. This is creating confusion, and due to the historical data, preventing the application of an otherwise valid license.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI launched a fresh gitlab-ee via docker `gitlab/gitlab-ee:latest` (`13.8.1-ee (e10a21e66ce)`) and first installed a Premium license for 5 seats.  I added a regular user (with no projects), two guest users, and guest group in which I placed 1 guest user.  In Premium, all of those users take a license seat, and my billable users and historical max accurately reflected 4 users (those 3 plus admin):\n\n```\ngitlabhq_production=# select * from historical_data order by id desc limit 1;\n-[ RECORD 1 ]-----+------------------------------\nid                | 4\ndate              | \nactive_user_count | 4\ncreated_at        | 2021-01-28 16:54:35.663305\nupdated_at        | 2021-01-28 16:54:35.663305\nrecorded_at       | 2021-01-28 16:54:35.661328+00\n```\n\nI created a project, added guest1 directly as a guest, and the guest group also as a guest:\n\n`http://localhost:8888/api/v4/projects/2/members/all`\n\n```\n[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Administrator\",\"username\":\"root\",\"state\":\"active\",\"web_url\":\"http://c731d91d1d07/root\",\"access_level\":40,\"created_at\":\"2021-01-28T16:39:13.433Z\",\"expires_at\":null},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"guest1\",\"username\":\"guest1\",\"state\":\"active\",\"web_url\":\"http://c731d91d1d07/guest1\",\"access_level\":10,\"created_at\":\"2021-01-28T16:39:26.289Z\",\"expires_at\":null},{\"id\":6,\"name\":\"guest2\",\"username\":\"guest2\",\"state\":\"active\",\"web_url\":\"http://c731d91d1d07/guest2\",\"access_level\":10,\"created_at\":\"2021-01-28T16:48:29.229Z\",\"expires_at\":null}]\n```\n\nI then installed an Ultimate trial license, also for 5 users, and observed that my billable users count did not decrease to account for the now 2 free guests and 1 user without project. To further confirm, I added another regular user, and another guest which I added to the guest group.  I used the regular user to create a project, so this user would take a seat.\n\nAt this point in time, I now have 5 users created, the 1 admin, and 2 bots created by GitLab. Observe my `/admin/users`:\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-28-12_27](/uploads/f27a743c737e194396d22c4e1e6c8e0b/screenshot-2021-01-28-12_27.png)\n\nUser page of a guest which shows its highest role as guest and it not taking a seat:\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-28-13_22](/uploads/be8a36e1d1e47c20193f0f7dd07c1415/screenshot-2021-01-28-13_22.png)\n\nAnd yet, my billable users remains 6:\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-28-12_28](/uploads/243a2031e005117b0309e23ecf512e8e/screenshot-2021-01-28-12_28.png)\n\nAfter running the usage statistics workers, my `/admin/dashboard/stats` shows:\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-28-12_29](/uploads/bac2c646b8c1b8ed483d2a00a920cc31/screenshot-2021-01-28-12_29.png)\n\nAccording to the user stats, those are 4 users (1 w/o group or project + 3 guests) that should not be counting as taking a license seat in GitLab Ultimate.  Sidenote, the usage stats page states there are 8 billable users, which is also incorrect.\n\nInterestingly, manually counting the users taking a seat from console reflects the true number:\n\n```ruby\nirb(main):025:0\u003e c = []\n=\u003e []\nirb(main):026:1* User.all.each do |u|\nirb(main):027:1*   c.push(u) if u.using_license_seat?\nirb(main):028:0\u003e end\n=\u003e [#\u003cUser id:1 @root\u003e, #\u003cUser id:2 @reggy1\u003e, #\u003cUser id:3 @guest1\u003e, #\u003cUser id:4 @alert-bot\u003e, #\u003cUser id:5 @support-bot\u003e, #\u003cUser id:6 @guest2\u003e, #\u003cUser id:7 @reggy2\u003e, #\u003cUser id:8 @guest3\u003e]\nirb(main):029:0\u003e c.count\n=\u003e 2\n\nirb(main):031:1* User.all.each do |u|\nirb(main):032:2*   if u.highest_role \u003c= 10 and u.using_license_seat?\nirb(main):033:2*     puts u.name,u.projects,u.groups\nirb(main):034:1*   end\nirb(main):035:0\u003e end\n=\u003e [#\u003cUser id:1 @root\u003e, #\u003cUser id:2 @reggy1\u003e, #\u003cUser id:3 @guest1\u003e, #\u003cUser id:4 @alert-bot\u003e, #\u003cUser id:5 @support-bot\u003e, #\u003cUser id:6 @guest2\u003e, #\u003cUser id:7 @reggy2\u003e, #\u003cUser id:8 @guest3\u003e]\nirb(main):036:0\u003e # Outputs nothing because there are no guest users using_license_seat\n\nirb(main):030:0\u003e User.active.count\n=\u003e 6\n```\n\nThe HistoricalDataWorker [does not run when a trial license is present](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/459281c81972c59fb5c2f90f508e31ab8d270a97/ee/app/workers/historical_data_worker.rb#L12-16), so my historical max is still 4 at this point\n\n```ruby\nirb(main):041:0\u003e HistoricalData.max_historical_user_count\n=\u003e 4\n```\n\nActivating a non-trial license to allow it to run, my historical is incremented to 6:\n\n```ruby\nirb(main):045:0\u003e License.current.trial?\n=\u003e false\nirb(main):046:0\u003e HistoricalData.max_historical_user_count\n=\u003e 6\n```\n\nFinally, when applying a new license, it appears that the background processes that validate the license *do correctly calculate* the true billable users count, although historical usage is still a factor.  Using my same test instance wherein only 2 users are actually taking a seat, if I truncate my historical data, GitLab allows me to upload and apply a license for only 2 users (and 0 previous, 0 true-ups), despite my dashboard showing 6 billable users\n\n```ruby\nirb(main):048:0\u003e HistoricalData.max_historical_user_count\n=\u003e 0\nirb(main):049:0\u003e c.count\n=\u003e 2\n```\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-28-13_02](/uploads/9f368e6e94a367076385611ef9a563cb/screenshot-2021-01-28-13_02.png)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsers that should not be taking a license seat in GitLab Ultimate are taking a license seat, which has an impact for both current customers of Ultimate (incorrect true-ups), and customers trying to upgrade to Ultimate (license wont activate due to inaccurate counts).\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGuests and users without groups/projects should not be taking a license seat\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nOn the customer's instance, we grabbed UsersStatistics:\n\n```ruby\n=\u003e #\u003cUsersStatistics id: 250, created_at: \"2021-01-27 15:02:08\", updated_at: \"2021-01-27 15:02:08\", without_groups_and_projects: 6, with_highest_role_guest: 25, with_highest_role_reporter: 0, with_highest_role_developer: 10, with_highest_role_maintainer: 69, with_highest_role_owner: 24, bots: 24, blocked: 19\u003e\n```\n\nwithout_groups_and_projects: 6  \nwith_highest_role_guest: 25\n\n31 total users that should not be taking a seat. I asked the customer to run the same `using_license_seat?` count block from above:\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-27-15_11-crop](/uploads/0b32ddde4ff1fc83c181245be33ae3d7/screenshot-2021-01-27-15_11-crop.png)\n\n103 + 31 for a total of 134, matching their admin dashboard:\n\n![screenshot-2021-01-27-15_50-crop](/uploads/be061acf84e8bc6064e0c61a34f45cf5/screenshot-2021-01-27-15_50-crop.png)\n\n#### Environment\n\nMy environment is a fresh install of latest GitLab (13.8.1-ee) via docker; no modifications or configurations. Customer running Omnibus GitLab 13.7.x.\n\n### Possible fixes or workarounds\n\nRight now, the only workaround that I am aware of is to ship a license with inaccurate user counts, or manually manipulate the `historical_data` table, since this number is possibly including guests that should not be in the maximum user count.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-28T18:24:50.104Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T20:59:10.996Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T19:04:45.845Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna

Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n  - Not applicable https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58480\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set jira_issue_association_on_merge_request true`)\n- [ ] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry - In a dedicated [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335280)\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel - In a dedicated [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335280)\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set jira_issue_association_on_merge_request false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-28T10:06:50.947Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T12:40:06.656Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T12:40:06.644Z","closed_by":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::manage","feature flag","group::compliance","priority::1","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"}],"author":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300271","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":11,"completed_count":7},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"7 of 11 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300271","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300271/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300271/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300271","relative":"#300271","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300271"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4637,"epic":{"id":127687,"iid":4637,"title":"Make the process of associating a Jira issue with a merge request more clear and reliable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4637","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":77985175,"iid":300269,"project_id":278964,"title":"List SSH keys API for user leaks comments for SSH Keys to anyone else the authenticated user","description":"**[HackerOne report #1088753](https://hackerone.com/reports/1088753)** by `tnir` on 2021-01-27, assigned to @vdesousa:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\n`List SSH keys for user` API leaks comments for SSH Keys to anyone else the authenticated user, including an anonymous user.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Prepare GitLab CE or EE 13.8 (or 13.x, 12.x, etc.) without restricting \"public\" visibility level at instance level on any VM or Kubernetes etc. GitLab.com is a one of candidate as of 2021-01-27.  \n2. Add a (normal) user with one or more SSH Keys to the instance. Suppose their user URL is `https://gitlab.example.com/ABC` and their SSH public key is`ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGxHKibQ8waefwkJtNa6JkhgljEnOluSnKT/VNlhDFAw root@gitlab.com`  \n3. Confirm `https://gitlab.example.com/ABC.keys` showing all SSH public keys in a list  \n4. With another user credential and/or without any credential, execute `curl https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/users/ABC/keys` and then receive every part of SSH public keys as well as registration datetime of each key.  \n5. `root@gitlab.com` part of the SSH public key is just a comment, but potentially and often it can contain username and hostname that key generated. This can be a leak for another attack vector.\n\n#####  Impact\n\n`root@gitlab.com` part of the SSH public key is just a comment, but potentially and often it can contain username and hostname that key generated. This can be a leak for another attack vector.\n\nAlso User ABC does not expect to disclose the comment usually including username and hostname or something they like.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/api/v4/users/stanhu/keys is one of the examples.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAnyone even anonymous user can get all data around SSH keys.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnly the authenticate user (and instance admin) can get these data, and anyone else cannot get data except for a list of public keys.  \nThat is, anyone else should not get `.id`, `.title`, `.created_at`, `.expires_at`, and the comment part of `.key`.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/api/v4/users/stanhu/keys is one of the examples.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis security bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n####  Impact\n\n`root@gitlab.com` part of the SSH public key is just a comment, but potentially and often it can contain username and hostname that key generated. This can be a leak for another attack vector.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-28T09:44:46.205Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T07:37:08.295Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T13:42:55.728Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-200","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-04-28","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300269","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300269","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300269/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300269/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300269","relative":"#300269","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300269"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77983631,"iid":300265,"project_id":278964,"title":"Misleading username could lead to impersonation in using SSH Certificates","description":"**[HackerOne report #1087806](https://hackerone.com/reports/1087806)** by `ledz1996` on 2021-01-26, assigned to @cmaxim:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nThere exists in vulnerability in checking the value of argument passing to `gitlab-shell`\n\n**internal/command/commandargs/shell.go**  \n```go  \nvar (  \n\twhoKeyRegex      = regexp.MustCompile(`\\bkey-(?P\u003ckeyid\u003e\\d+)\\b`)  \n\twhoUsernameRegex = regexp.MustCompile(`\\busername-(?P\u003cusername\u003e\\S+)\\b`)  \n)\n```\n\nThese regex does not check whether it is start with either `key-` or `username-`\n\nLater on  \n```go  \n\tfor _, argument := range s.Arguments {  \n\t\tif keyId := tryParseKeyId(argument); keyId != \"\" {  \n\t\t\ts.GitlabKeyId = keyId  \n\t\t\tbreak  \n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif username := tryParseUsername(argument); username != \"\" {  \n\t\t\ts.GitlabUsername = username  \n\t\t\tbreak  \n\t\t}  \n\t}  \n```\n\nAs you can see `whoKeyRegex` and `whoUsernameRegex` are used to parse `username` or `id of SSH-key`.

Even though it's not something convicing as it requires the CA server to generate a Certificate with an username of something like `key-2`, but I would report it anyway  \n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nPre-requisites:  \n- Set up SSH Certificate system as  https://berndbausch.medium.com/ssh-certificates-a45bdcdfac39 or https://www.jadaptive.com/openssh-certificate-cheat-sheet/  \n- Set up SSH Certificate system in gitlab as https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/ssh_certificates.html  \n- Have an user with SSH key setup\n\nSteps:  \n- Create an SSH Certificate for an user named `key-2`, it is possible to create an user with this username in gitlab  \n- This will allow the user receiving the certificate to impersonate user with key id 2  \n- Do what ever the user

This causes that kind of failure to always set `verification_retry_count` to 1, instead of incrementing it.\n1. `verification_failed_batch_relation` and `needs_verification_relation` are not excluding things which have a `verification_retry_at` in the future\n\n## Proposal\n\n- [x] Call `reset` before calling `verification_failed_with_message!` in the rescue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/lib/gitlab/geo/verification_state.rb#L222?\n- [x] Scope `verification_failed_batch_relation` and `needs_verification_relation` to `where(\"verification_retry_at \u003c NOW()\")`\n- [x] Adjust index `package_file_registry_needs_verification` if needed\n- [x] Adjust index `package_file_registry_failed_verification` if needed","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-28T05:56:08.665Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T15:27:14.374Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T07:43:21.036Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","devops::systems","feature::addition","group::geo","section::enablement","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300255","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":4},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300255","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300255/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300255/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300255","relative":"#300255","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300255"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1817,"epic":{"id":11333,"iid":1817,"title":"Geo: Self Service Framework -
