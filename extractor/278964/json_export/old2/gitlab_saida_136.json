goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe Package stage allows you to publish, consume, and discover images, all in one place. Users publish and pull images using GitLab CI/CD, the command line, or the GitLab API. When users have to navigate a large number of image repositories, information such as repository visibility and when a tag was last published helps users determine the health of the repository. Currently, it is difficult to gather that information.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nImprove the experience of understanding data related to an image repository, specifically allowing users to quickly understand how recently the image repository was updated as well as the visibility of that project.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd an `eye` icon for an image repository belonging to a public project and include high-level information about when this image repository was last updated.\n\n| Image Repository delete button |\n|---|\n| ![Add_last_published_and_visibility](/uploads/d5c0b7b867ce368c192c2c6d146d1775/Add_last_published_and_visibility.png) |\n\n### Further details\n\nThe `eye` icon should be used when an image repository is associated with a public project. The `eye-slash` icon should be used for image repositories associated with a private project or group.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-06T14:42:06.091Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T22:17:52.397Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T09:17:00.894Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò

We stopped doing that in March 2020: https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/12/free-period-for-cicd-external-repositories/\n\nWhen we did that, we ran into performance issues with the sheer number of free private mirrors we were loading into memory, only to reject: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212074\n\nWe addressed this by checking the plan in the query, and only searching for mirrors that are either:\n\n1. On paid plans.\n2. On public projects. (As public projects get Gold features for free.) - this is no [longer valid](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/02/04/ultimate-perks-for-open-source-projects/) as of 2022-02-17 for new projects and 2022-07-01 for all free public projects.\n\n## Problem\n\nThis query got slower over time, because the database still had to inspect all of the 'old' pull mirrors: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216252\n\nThis is because we search for all pull mirrors and put them in order where the one that was updated least frequently is first. As all the free private pull mirrors stopped being processed in March, they were always at the front of this set, and the query performance degraded.\n\nThis query is listed as a top 50 queries by total time in https://console.postgres.ai/gitlab/gitlab_production/reports/425/files/113266/md#postgres-checkup_K003\n\nThis performance issue was explored in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325503.\n\n### Workaround\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216252#note_334514544 describes a hacky workaround where we make sure that we only look for mirrors that are supposed to be next mirrored after we disabled free pull mirroring. This buys us some time, but has its own problems.\n\n### New problems\n\n1. If a user had a free private pull mirror that was due to be updated before 2020-03-28, and then either make the project public or pay for a plan, it won't resume automatically. They will need to [force an update](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html#forcing-an-update-core).\n2. The query was already complex, and now it has an extra wrinkle specifically for GitLab.com.\n\n## Proposal\n\nSomehow mark these mirrors as inactive, in such a way that:\n\n1. It's cheap to do. (Maybe just a migration that only runs for GitLab.com?)\n2. It's easy for a user to restart their mirror.\n\nThen we can remove all of the block inside `if check_mirror_plans_in_query?` in `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker#pull_mirrors_batch`, making the query much simpler and easier to reason about.\n\nWe can also remove the part of `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker#schedule_mirrors!` that links to this issue in a comment.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-06T12:57:07.095Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T12:00:59.047Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T12:46:57.591Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","backend","bug::performance","devops::create","group::scalability","group::source code","infradev","mirror","missed-deliverable","missed:14.10","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","missed:14.5","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","missed:14.9","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216783","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216783","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216783/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216783/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216783","relative":"#216783","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216783"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5879,"epic":{"id":257945,"iid":5879,"title":"Mirroring configuration and controls","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5879","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34200464,"iid":216761,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add image repository level delete functionality to the Image Repository detail view","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Users publish and pull images using GitLab CI/CD, the command line, or the GitLab API. \n\nWhen handling large numbers of image repositories, it is not uncommon for users to want to delete the image repository after viewing the details. Currently, this requires unique navigation back to the list view to delete the image repository, which can cause a loss of context for users.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nImprove the delete image repository experience by allowing users to delete an image repository while currently viewing the details.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a delete image repository button to the UI.

It is assumed that the user will need to confirm the delete action before returning to this screen.  The image repository list view should also appear disabled. \n\nThe MVC does not include a way to \"un-delete\" the image repository.

Currently, there is no way to tell how many tags an image repository has without viewing the details.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nImprove the experience of browsing image repositories by adding the tag count of an image repository to the list view.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the number of tags in an image repository to the image repository list view of the Container Registry UI.\n\n| Image Repository List with Tag count  |\n|---|\n| ![Image_repository_list_view_with_tag_info](/uploads/6411e46918b91788a2e40c8c5ec1cc2c/Image_repository_list_view_with_tag_info.png) |\n\n### Further details\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

This becomes especially important when the number of total image repositories requires pagination.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the header section of the Container Registry UI to include the number of image repositories contained in this registry and details of the expiration policy.\n\n| Container Registry UI Header Section |\n|---|\n| ![Update_Header_Information](/uploads/bfd4fc01c2ab9807d3e4fbd0696c8f27/Update_Header_Information.png) |\n\n### Further details\n\nOpen Question: \n\n- When a container registry does not have expiration policies enabled, should we remove the expiration policy moment entirely, or add copy saying \"expiration policies disabled\"\n\nOther Notes: \n\n- I'm suggesting we update the copy in the header section.  In testing, users really appreciated the direct link to the documentation. I am suggesting we remove the references to Docker.\n- I have updated the `Quick Start` wording to `CLI Commands` as per this UXR Insight: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/uxr_insights/-/issues/1094\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

There is some logic written to shoehorn these different states into the same HTML. Breaking `diff_table_cell` out into two components will simplify this logic an allow us to remove an event watcher that causes the page to be laggy during hover effects.\n\nRemoving that lag is a prereq for multiline commenting.\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14128\n\n### Fancy mermaid diagrams\n\n#### Current layout\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  diff_content \u003c|-- inline_diff_view\n  diff_content \u003c|-- parallel_diff_view\n  inline_diff_view \u003c|-- inline_diff_table_row\n  parallel_diff_view \u003c|-- parallel_diff_table_row\n  inline_diff_table_row \u003c|-- diff_table_cell\n  parallel_diff_table_row \u003c|-- diff_table_cell\n  diff_table_cell \u003c|-- diff_gutter_avatars\n```\n\n#### Proposed layout\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  diff_content \u003c|-- inline_diff_view\n  diff_content \u003c|-- parallel_diff_view\n  inline_diff_view \u003c|-- inline_diff_table_row\n  parallel_diff_view \u003c|-- parallel_diff_table_row\n  inline_diff_table_row \u003c|-- inline_diff_table_cell\n  parallel_diff_table_row \u003c|-- parallel_diff_table_cell\n  inline_diff_table_cell \u003c|-- diff_gutter_avatars\n  parallel_diff_table_cell \u003c|-- diff_gutter_avatars\n```\n\n## Improvements\n\nPerformance boost for hover states over `*_diff_table_row`\nSimple logic for rendering.\n\n## Risks\n\nMost of the refactored code involves displaying user avatars and comment buttons. The biggest concern is that altering this code could cause comments/discussions to stop working. Either discussions will not be displayed properly or the ability to comment could be broken.\n\nTo mitigate we will only refactor one \"side\" at a time. i.e. just the inline view, then the parallel view. This is possible because new components have to be built for the refactoring. Also, the logic for the shared components is localized to those components. So this could potentially be feature flagged, or at the very least easy to roll back.\n\n## Involved components\n\nBase path: `app/assets/javascripts/diffs/components`\n\n- diff_content\n- inline_diff_view\n- parallel_diff_view\n- inline_diff_table_row\n- parallel_diff_table_row\n- diff_table_cell\n- diff_gutter_avatars","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-06T04:09:55.423Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T16:46:42.901Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T00:19:45.942Z","closed_by":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Stretch","backstage [DEPRECATED]","customer","customer+","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.0","missed:13.2","missed:13.3","missed:13.4","missed:13.5","missed:13.6","section::dev","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216680","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216680","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216680/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216680/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216680","relative":"#216680","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216680"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34177082,"iid":216663,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate usage of Wappalyzer","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

User gets redirected to the SAML provider to sign in. \n4. On redirect, user is sent to the regular GitLab sign in page with a message that they must sign in or sign up to link their account.\n\n## Workaround\n\n1. Have user reset their password.\n1.

The discussion started, because Ubuntu 20.04 ships with PG12, see the GDK issue for context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/issues/682#note_335540308\n\nOne change in PG12 might be relevant/important for Geo (from the release notes):\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nMove `recovery.conf` settings into [`postgresql.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-ARCHIVE-RECOVERY) (Masao Fujii, Simon Riggs, Abhijit Menon-Sen, Sergei Kornilov)\n\n`recovery.conf` is no longer used, and the server will not start if that file exists. [`recovery.signal`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-ARCHIVE-RECOVERY) and `standby.signal` files are now used to switch into non-primary mode. The `trigger_file` setting has been renamed to [`promote_trigger_file`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-PROMOTE-TRIGGER-FILE). The `standby_mode` setting has been removed.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n`@eread` was testing Geo on GDK and PG12 a little while ago, but he ran into this issue: https://pgstef.github.io/2018/11/26/postgresql12_preview_recovery_conf_disappears.html\n\nThe article dates back from back from before PG12 was released, so some info might be incorrect. But still, there might a problem.\n\n### Impact on GDK\n\nIt's not clear to me what is wrong with PG12 on GDK. I guess we should set it up, and see what happens. I'm hopeful we can fix it with minimal changes.\n\n### Impact on omnibus\n\nThis is even less clear. `@stanhu` thought `recovery.conf` was used to promote a secondary, but it seems `pg_ctl promote` is used, so we should be good here\n\n### Suggestion\n\nWe better try to make GDK work with Geo and PG12 soon, but increasingly more people will no longer be able to run PG11 on their development machines.\n\nAlso [PG12 will be landing in 13.3](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2184), so it would be nice to be ahead of the game.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-05T13:23:19.743Z","updated_at":"2021-01-12T23:13:56.523Z","closed_at":"2020-06-18T18:38:55.831Z","closed_by":{"id":4554077,"username":"nhxnguyen","name":"Nick

Why not use your GitLab project? You are already storing your code there and you are probably using GitLab CI. It's easy to publish and install packages using your pipeline. In fact, if you are using GitLab CI/CD to publish and update your gems, you can easily find the pipeline, commit and branch responsible for updating that gem. Authentication is easy. Simply use your personal access token. With support for job and deploy tokens coming soon. \n\n### Problem to solve\nAs part of our goal to build a product that in 3 years will allow 90% of our customers to use GitLab for all of their package management needs, we must add support for common package manager formats, such as RubyGems. Prior to adding support for a given package manager, we need to have a task of investigation of documentation, API endpoints, and other implementation requirements. \n\nThis issue is intended to detail the requirements for the RubyGems Repository MVC and link to issues outside the scope of the MVC. It will be considered complete when the product developers have broken down the MVC into sub-issues and added them to the [RubyGems Repository epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3200).\n\n### Proposal \nInvestigate adding RubyGems support to the GitLab Package Registry. Based on that investigation, identify a reasonable MVC that can be delivered in 1-2 milestones.\n- Create, size and schedule a list of sub-issues and add them to the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3200)\n\n#### Scope of MVC\n1. Use your GitLab project as a RubyGems remote\n1. Authenticate with your GitLab personal access token\n1. Publish gems to your project\n1. Install gems from your project\n1. Measure `push_package` and `pull_package` events on GitLab.com using Snowplow\n\n#### Beyond the MVC\n1. Measure usage with the usage ping\n1. The Package Registry UI supports RubyGems, including install and setup commands, build and package specific metadata.\n1. Authenticate with a job, deploy, or project access token.\n1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` template to make getting started easy.\n1. Begin dogfooding the registry \n1. Starting in RubyGems 2.0, a Specification can hold arbitrary metadata. We should consider supporting arbitrary metadata.\n\n#### Metadata\n\nMetadata will need to be extracted, similar to how we handle NuGet. For the MVC we will extract the following fields:\n\n- authors=\n- files\n- name\n- summary\n- version\n- description\n- email\n- homepage\n- license=\n- licenses=\n- metadata\n\n\nAfter the MVC, we'll add:\n-  add_development_dependency\n-  add_runtime_dependency\n-  author=\n-  bindir\n-  cert_chain\n-  executables\n-  extensions\n-  extra_rdoc_files\n-  platform=\n-  post_install_message\n-  rdoc_options\n-  require_paths=\n-  required_ruby_version\n-  required_ruby_version=\n-  required_rubygems_version\n-  required_rubygems_version=\n-  requirements\n-  rubygems_version\n-  signing_key\n\n### Permissions and Security\nThe permissions should follow the same levels as all other package registries\n\n### Links / references\n- http://docs.seattlerb.org/rubygems/\n- https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-rate-limits/\n- https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-04T21:34:28.118Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T18:05:19.931Z","closed_at":"2021-01-22T17:17:24.103Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Dogfooding","Dogfooding::Build in GitLab","Package:P1","RubyGems Repository","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216517","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216517","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216517/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216517/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216517","relative":"#216517","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216517"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3200,"epic":{"id":49403,"iid":3200,"title":"Make the RubyGems Repository  generally available (GA)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3200","group_id":9970,"human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e758\u003c/strong\u003e days elapsed"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34127187,"iid":216514,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use DAST Scan profiles from database","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nTo simplify the configuration of DAST for customers, customers can create scan and site profiles in \"on-demand\" scans. Today, they can then run a DAST scan through the web interface using those scan and site profiles. This eliminates the need for the user to configure or create a YAML file. \n\nHowever, if customers want to run a scan in their pipeline they have to configure all variables in their YAML file. There is no way they can leverage the profiles they created in the web interface. \n\n### Proposal\n\nGitLab introduces new job-level keyword to `.gitlab-ci.yml` called `dast_configuration`:\n\n```yaml\ndast:\n  stage: dast\n  dast_configuration:\n    site_profile: \"site-profile-name\"\n    scanner_profile: \"scanner-profile-name\"\n  script:\n   - echo\n```\n\nCustomers set the value of `dast:variables` to include the names of the profiles that they have previously saved in the database.\n\n#### Technical details\n\n**Note:** The developer should get a spike of this implementation into review by the CI team as quickly in the process as possible.\n\n- [x] Refactor DAST on-demand config generation (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326953)\n- [x] DAST On-Demand Scans - Add Explicit Secrets Authorization Schema (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330297)\n- [x] Evaluate the `variables:` keyword and add the corresponding job variables to the job. This will probably take place in [`Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Seed::Build`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/98fc0227320c0379bf79d8add7915aa34395e536/lib/gitlab/ci/pipeline/seed/build.rb). Add non-secret variables from the DAST profile to attributes passed into [`Gitlab::Ci::Build::Context::Build`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f56372f52c289c75128cfa69e88640337eaa8827/lib/gitlab/ci/pipeline/seed/build.rb#L196) (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62986)\n- [x] Associate secret variables.\n- [x] Throw error when profile not found (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334236)\n- [x] Update ~documentation \n\n**Additional context:** `Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Seed::Build` is used in the `Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Chain::Seed` step of the pipeline creation process. The full chain is defined in [Ci::CreatePipelineService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f56372f52c289c75128cfa69e88640337eaa8827/app/services/ci/create_pipeline_service.rb#L19)\n\n### Implementation Questions\n\n1. Ensure we can handle authentication values that were saved in site profiles. \n1. The scan and site profiles will be updated with additional fields as DAST grows. Architect this so that as new fields are added to the scan and site profiles they can flow into DAST without updates.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-04T21:30:09.157Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T05:25:26.409Z","closed_at":"2021-06-29T05:02:47.411Z","closed_by":{"id":5749348,"username":"philipcunningham","name":"Philip Cunningham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5749348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/philipcunningham"},"labels":["Category:DAST","auto updated","backend","devops::secure","documentation","group::dynamic analysis","priority::1","section::sec","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":5749348,"username":"philipcunningham","name":"Philip Cunningham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5749348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/philipcunningham"}],"author":{"id":4310743,"username":"sethgitlab","name":"Seth Berger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4310743/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethgitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5749348,"username":"philipcunningham","name":"Philip Cunningham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5749348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/philipcunningham"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216514","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216514","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216514/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216514/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216514","relative":"#216514","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216514"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3323,"epic":{"id":54112,"iid":3323,"title":"DAST: UI configuration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3323","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":34124216,"iid":216503,"project_id":278964,"title":"Snippet slugifying breaks URL in markdown comment","description":"## Description\n\n[In this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/7507#note_336222233), I'm trying to leave a link to the embedded snippet URL, but the slugifying is too greedy and doesn't slugs the URL :disappointed:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-04_at_2.37.57_PM](/uploads/290364dec4d35de602740326519d2b0f/Screen_Shot_2020-05-04_at_2.37.57_PM.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\nI'd expect the slugifying behavior to see that I'm trying to link to a `.js` file and leave this URL alone.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Activity\n\n@fjsanpedro:\n* Check the reference is not replaced when the url ends with and extension\n\n@vij:\n* Test reference filter ignores snippet embed URLs\n\n## MR Breakdown\n\n@fjsanpedro:\n* We need to check where that reference is replaced and, if the url has an extension, abort the replacement","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-04T19:40:35.639Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T13:59:53.474Z","closed_at":"2021-09-13T03:02:56.599Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","good for new contributors","group::editor","priority::4","section::dev","severity::4","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

With this update, you can now publish releases without giving access to the source code to users. This is useful for organizations that use releases as a way to give access to new versions of software but do not want the source code to be public.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nIt's not uncommon for projects to be closed source (no public access to the source code) but publish some kind of compiled asset to the public (e.g. an `.exe` or a `.dmg`).\n\nAt the moment, GitLab does not support this use case. Current options are:\n\n1. Private projects, which requires that users who need to access the release assets be explicitly granted Guest permissions (which has its own issues: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213016)\n1. Public projects, which gives everyone full access to the source code\n1. Public projects with the Repository visibility set to \"Only Project Members\":\n\n   ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/2d98c9c3de6a308b3b978a8e337f9281/image.png)\n\n   ... which also makes the **Releases** tab/page visible only to project members.\n\n### Intended users\n\nMostly [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager).\n\n### Proposal\n\nOne option might be to add a new permission option under **Settings \u003e General \u003e Visibility, project features, permissions** to control the visibility of Releases:\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e8a5cde6dfb2e7a5b2663bed7faa8160/image.png)\n\n### Further details\n\nOne sticky detail that should probably be solved before this feature is delivered is how to reference and display Releases without exposing any tag data to users who shouldn't have access to repository information.\n\nThis issue is described in detail here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213016#root-cause\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

Most of our Release functionality is Core at the moment, but perhaps this functionality is specialized enough to warrant being restricted to a higher tier.\n\n### Links / references\n\nSome related discussions:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16328\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/22165\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201770\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Remove the Releases feature toggle from the behind the `split_operations_visibility_permissions` FF -

I cannot see it used. Nor can I see it tested. I'm inclined to think that if the method is used consistently for counting things in redis then we'll probably always be happy for it to return `-1` as a fallback since this is always a good choice for a missing count. Further it seems that the underlying method calls imply this is only used for counts so I'd suggest we remove this argument. It would also be nice to remove because missing different styles for optional arguments in this way is kinda hard to read so it will be much cleaner without that argument.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-04T09:44:01.538Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T10:59:57.215Z","closed_at":"2020-05-13T10:59:57.176Z","closed_by":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"labels":["devops::growth","group::product intelligence"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"}],"author":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216452","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216452","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216452/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216452/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216452","relative":"#216452","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216452"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34089002,"iid":216444,"project_id":278964,"title":"CI linter: Extend errors messaging to include warnings","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

In order for this to be the most useful it should run on every pipeline and display them somewhere prominently.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003eExpand to an example\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nTravis does this nicely, showing linting panel for every job, for example:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-04_at_8.57.05_AM](/uploads/4c0d537bbc437646ca0d4a3d7086c10d/Screen_Shot_2020-05-04_at_8.57.05_AM.png)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n### Proposal\n\nFor this MVC:\n* Extend the [existing red banner for errors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/590809a1eebf6b4cf41af6240d6f84e5/Screenshot_2020-05-08_at_20.36.56.png) to handle **errors** and also **warning**.\n* Add warnings for these scenarios:\n1. Using `rules` without `workflow: rules`; link to the [workflow:rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/pipelines.html#workflowrules) docs\n1.  ~~Using `rules` and `only/except` in the same job is not supported~~\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003e(expand here for part of original proposal that is scoped to issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219431)\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n---\n\nStore each offenses, one per line, as part of `YAML errors`, each identified with a severity, such as:\n* error:\n* warning:\n* deprecation:\n\nThe format of a single line message could be:\n\n```\n\u003cseverity\u003e: \u003cjob-name\u003e: \u003cmessage\u003e\n```\n\nWe could use this `yaml_errors` to also further refine the Build View and show this information there\n\nToday, we would do these things:\n\n* we just refine this box to present it differently on ~frontend based on severity\n* we would need to add a small change to `Ci::Config` to allow easy way to generate `warning` and `deprecations`, join them together and persist as part of `ci_pipelines.yaml_errors`, including a context in above format\n\n---\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Execution plan\n\n1. Replace `has_yaml_errors?` with `config_error?` so that it won't use `yaml_errors` which will hold a different type of messages with this feature\n1. Add mechanism inside `YamlProcessor` that allows to append warning messages as we do today with errors. Warning messages could be used to also describe deprecation warnings. We could distinguish them later.\n    - Maybe we could extend `Gitlab::Config::Entry::Configurable` to have helper methods such as `add_warning`\n1. Store multiple messages in `Ci::Pipeline#yaml_errors`. Ensure that `pipeline.errors` don't include warnings or deprecations.\n1. Expose warnings in the frontend and API response for the Linter / Pipeline view - **this marks the 1st iteration, from user perspective**\n\n---\n\nIn preparation to work on this maybe we need to first open a MR about replacing the use of `has_yaml_errors?` with `config_error?`. Then, we can make `yaml_errors` orthogonal to `failure_reason` as we may not have any failure reasons but warnings in `yaml_errors`.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate?

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes - Yes\n  * Ensure renaming does not affect existing behaviors - Error messages should still be displayed\n  * Warnings message should show up where there is violation even if pipeline did not fail\n* Integration test changes - Yes\n  * Integration test API ~\u003e UI:\n    * Warnings and deprecation messages are recognized and displayed accordingly\n    * In case pipeline did fail with a config error and there are also warning violation, show both error and warning in the banner.\n* End-to-end test change - not required\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

Creating Snippets**:\n\nCreating a Snippet in the GitLab UI this results in an `\"invalid path: http://test.my.url:3000/breaks/things\"` error being displayed to the user\n\n**2. Updating Snippets**:\n\nA generic `\"Error updating the snippet\"` message is displayed when updating an existing Snippet\n\n**3. Migrating Snippets to versioned**:\n\nMigration of existing Snippets in the [backfill migration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/background_migration/backfill_snippet_repositories.rb) fails in this scenario\n\n### What we need to do\n\nWe can potentially address these issues in the following way:\n\n1. Creating Snippets - catch the error and display a more friendly message, e.g. `Invalid file name used`\n\n2. Updating Snippets - catch this error and return a useful message to the user so they know what they have to address to proceed\n\n3. Migrating Snippets - catch this error and `parameterize` (or some other equivalent?) the file name so that it becomes valid and the migration can succeed.\n\nThis can be handled in two separate MRs, one for create/update and the other for the migration with the priority being the migration solution due to it's current impact.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate or update an existing snippet accordingly, with the file name `http://test.my.url:3000/breaks/things`\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n1. Renders message from Gitaly/Rugged\n2. Unhelpful message delivered to users\n3. Migration fails\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n1. Appropriate message used\n2. Appropriate message used\n3. Migration succeeds\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screenshot_2020-04-30_at_16.26.45](/uploads/5de3f133ed0b961063ba921a8a6b9bf5/Screenshot_2020-04-30_at_16.26.45.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-30T15:32:53.921Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T09:42:21.307Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T09:42:21.217Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","backend","devops::create","group::editor","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216273","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216273","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216273/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216273/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216273","relative":"#216273","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216273"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":34004892,"iid":216268,"project_id":278964,"title":"Comment that turns into thread from polling doesn't show resolve button","description":"## Description\n\nNoticed on `.com`.

This is helpful for auditing any changes to the deployment process, since protected environments are typically used for deploying code to special environments such as production.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCustomers using [protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html) need to be able to audit when protections were added or removed.  \n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nWhen Environments are either protected or unprotected, an audit record should be generated as is done for protected branches.  The user shouldn't experience anything different but an audit record should be logged.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAs a company moves from the Single User experience to the Invite Other Users and Adopt All Features stages, they may include projects and environments that need to be protected.  Since removing protections has potentially harmful effects on the security of the environment, these events need to be logged. \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\nWhen a Maintainer or Owner protects or unprotects an environment, an audit record should be generated.  \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\nBuyer Personas: CISO,  Director - Risk Mgt\nEnterprise Tier: Premium\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nSee [Audit Event Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/audit_event_guide/#audit-event-guide) for details on implementation of Audit events.\n\nRelevant services: \n- `ProtectedEnvironments::CreateService`\n- `ProtectedEnvironments::UpdateService`\n- `ProtectedEnvironments::DestroyService`\n\nProtected environment settings can be changed via API or UI.
