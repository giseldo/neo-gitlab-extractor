For any instance that is `Gitlab::FIPS.enabled?`, PATs, PrATs, and GATS are not able to be created\n2. If PATs, PrATs, and GATS  already exist prior to turn this setting on, do nothing (Because this is ~FedRAMP only, this scenario should not exist to begin with. But if it does, ignore them)\n\n#### Future Iterations (Personal Access Token focused):\n\n1. Expand functionality so it's not limited to FIPS only instances\n2. Ability to enable/disable PAT creation from UI\n1. Ability to enable/disable PAT creation from Namespace level\n1. If PAT creation is disabled, existing PATs are revoked - this would include the ~frontend work of making it very clear that this is a disruptive action\n\n\n### Metrics\n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature? Think about user behavior and their interaction with the product. What indicates someone is getting value from it?\n\nCreate tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n\n--\u003e\n\n### Notes\n\nBefore this is released to customers outside of ~FedRAMP instances, thought needs to be put into what to do with existing PATs.\n\nWhat happens in the scenario where they are allowed, then disallowed, then allowed again? Should all existing PATs be revoked/deleted? Should they live again once the setting is turned back on?\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nAdd specs to cover following cases when PAT creation is disabled:\n\n\n* Ensure PATs, PrATs, and GATS cannot be created via the API or the UI\n* Admin's can also not create PATs, PrATs, and GATS  for other users via the API\n* Amin's cannot create PATs, PrATs, and GATS  for other users via the UI when they impersonate them\n* Any existing PATs, PrATs, and GATS will stop working","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-27T17:11:03.104Z","updated_at":"2023-01-07T10:08:22.078Z","closed_at":"2022-10-14T13:35:03.153Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Set up a relative URL prefix as described on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/relative_url.html.\n   - In GDK you need to set this in `gdk.yml` and run `gdk reconfigure`.\n   - The prefix needs to starts with a slash (e.g. `/your/prefix`).\n   - Make sure you restart GitLab to apply this change.\n1. Configure unauthenticated rate limits for web and API traffic, with a low threshold so you can trigger them easily.\n   - This can be done in the admin UI, see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/user_and_ip_rate_limits.html.\n1. Send unauthenticated requests to an API path (e.g. `/your/prefix/api/v4/groups`) until you get a 429 response.\n1. Check the `Ratelimit-Name` header in the response, it says `throttle_unauthenticated_web` rather than `throttle_unauthenticated_api`.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nRequests aren't correctly recognized, e.g. API traffic is counted as web traffic.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nRequests should still be correctly recognized.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\nThe path checks in `lib/gitlab/rack_attack/request.rb` also need to consider the relative URL root, like we do in e.g.

[Service Usage Data Center](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/product-intelligence/-/issues/501) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `admin_application_settings_service_usage_data_center` feature flag.\n\nWe're creating a separate page so users be able to review, redact and submit usage ping.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Product Intelligence\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_product_intelligence`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @nbelokolodov \n- PM: @amandarueda \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nA new page named \"Service Usage Data\" will be available from Admin menu. The page will have Preview Payload UI blocked moved from the Metric and profiling page\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\n\u003c!-- What are the settings we need to configure in order to have this feature viable? --\u003e\nWhen the feature flag is enabled. The fix does not have any other dependency.\n\u003c!-- \nExample below:\n \n1. Enable service ping collection\n   `ApplicationSetting.first.update(usage_ping_enabled: true)`\n--\u003e\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n\u003c!-- Should the feature flag be turned off? Any MRs that need to be rolled back? Communication that needs to happen? What are some things you can think of that could go wrong - data loss or broken pages? --\u003e\n\nWe dont any any new functionality with this FF, so only the newly added page might be broken.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n_Consider mentioning checks for 5xx errors or other anomalies like an increase in redirects \n(302 HTTP response status)_\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-26T22:14:13.471Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T20:29:55.450Z","closed_at":"2022-04-26T20:29:54.465Z","closed_by":{"id":9712164,"username":"nbelokolodov","name":"Niko Belokolodov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9712164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nbelokolodov"},"labels":["Category:Service Ping","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::growth","feature flag","group::product intelligence","missed:14.10","missed:14.9","section::growth","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":9712164,"username":"nbelokolodov","name":"Niko Belokolodov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9712164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nbelokolodov"}],"author":{"id":9712164,"username":"nbelokolodov","name":"Niko Belokolodov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9712164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nbelokolodov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9712164,"username":"nbelokolodov","name":"Niko Belokolodov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9712164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nbelokolodov"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351268","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":10},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"10 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351268","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351268/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351268/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351268","relative":"#351268","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351268"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7388,"epic":{"id":420531,"iid":7388,"title":"MVC: Create method for offline reporting of Product Usage Data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7388","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 22, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101336146,"iid":351262,"project_id":278964,"title":"404 when importing GitLab project","description":"From this page: https://gitlab.com/projects/new#import_project\n\n![image](/uploads/848214b02de143f8b5e42451ebf46f95/image.png)\n\nLeft-click works and gets you here: https://gitlab.com/import/gitlab_project/new?namespace_id=6908817\u0026name=\u0026path=\n\n![image](/uploads/30974be3a87c53f44a4091ce18381572/image.png)\n\nRight-click, open in a new tab doesn't work and gets you here: https://gitlab.com/import/gitlab_project/new\n\n![image](/uploads/9a87a298202e175611a86f57c279dd8d/image.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-26T21:03:09.944Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T19:41:37.693Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T11:11:22.898Z","closed_by":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Hackathon","Importer:Project Export/Import","SUS::Impacting","UX","devops::manage","frontend","good for new contributors","group::import","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

\n\n![Test_summary](/uploads/7c74e08839e15b05ed02bbbfb1821924/Test_summary.png)\n\n### Resources\n- [Related UX Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336173)\n- [Figma Design Specifications](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=40575%3A46838)\n- [Merge request reports framework](https://design.gitlab.com/regions/merge-request-reports)\n\n### Proposal\n\n**Add details and modal to the widget** (weight 2):\n\n* render the list of failed/fixed tests at level three, including the recent failures text\n  * i.e. `New: ProjectAccessToken validations requires the presence of a personal access token`\n* convert/import the modal component, make each test's name a link that fills its data into the modal and opens the modal\n* add the recent failures text at level one (this could be done in the first iteration if we decide that's easier during implementation)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-26T20:49:43.766Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T12:02:24.613Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T14:21:37.375Z","closed_by":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda

In an effort to help the user understand when remote include references are timing out, this issue is to improve the error messaging that is displayed when this scenario occurs.\n\n![image](/uploads/20d3cdd024f81f8bac5d56524f14fb76/image.png)\n\n### Solution\n\nBy returning an appropriate error messaging when remote include references are timing out, it will enhance the user experience so that the user understands what is happening and can take appropriate actions.\n\n~backend will change the message in `yaml_errors` to be `Request timed out when fetching configuration files.` (still weight 1)  \n~frontend will update the actual UI component, which includes the title --\u003e (Can be done by ~backend in the same MR since this is a `haml` update).\n\nNew error text should be:\n\n\u003e **Unable to create pipeline**\n\u003e \n\u003e Request timed out when fetching configuration files.\n\nWe will remove the link to CI Lint from the error

This is done in `Projects::OverwriteProjectService#execute` which does `Project.transaction` and then `#destroy_old_project` and then mentioned service. This service appears to be used by `import-export` feature. So, maybe they are the best team to solve this. This might also indicate that maybe we should keep this closed and create a new one. Do it at your discretion :)\n\nWe need to somehow fix `Projects::OverwriteProjectService#execute` to do it differently. To explicitly indicate this problem and place that needs to be considered the MR was created: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78079. By removing `allow_cross_database_modification_within_transaction` the buggy behavior will be triggered.\n\nFor now, I re-open this issue since this the most comprehensive description of the solution.\n\n\u003e Note: This was discovered now since the `./spec/services/projects/overwrite_project_service_spec.rb` was part of `spec/support/database/cross-database-modification-allowlist.yml` and was not removed once the original issue was merged.\n\n## Analysis\n\nBased on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340256#note_820203511\n\n@lmcandrew This is a tricky topic that is likely to involve product. First of all, project import with overwrite basically replaces existing project with a completely new one, while preserving the same name \u0026 path (and a few other things like user stars). One might achieve the same outcome by manually deleting old project and importing a new one under the same name. What is the expected behaviour of such failed import?\n\nI am guessing the main concern for using outermost `Project.transaction` during 'overwriting' process is to prevent potential data loss of the project that is being overridden, if something goes wrong. This service was introduced 4 years ago and didn't change much since. Does `Projects::DestroyService` guarantee against data loss if it fails to execute? I see there is `Projects::DestroyService#attempt_rollback` but it sounds like rollback is not guaranteed? Can there be a situation, where user initiated project import with overwrite fails because of destroy service failing, resulting in original project not being in it's original condition? Is this an acceptable potential outcome of a failed import attempt?\n\nIf destroy rollback preserves data then I think it should be possible to update it and not utilize the outer most `Project.transaction`, which should solve the issue of cross-DB transaction. If it doesn't - is partial data loss of the old project acceptable? Since project overwrite deletes the old project, does it matter which state the project is in if project destroy fails?\n\nCurrently the 'overwriting' process is:\n\n1. Update a set of relations' `project_id` from old to new (stars, members, group links, etc)\n1. Destroy old project\n1. Rename new project to old project's name/path\n\nI am proposing we update this process to start copying mentioned relation instead of updating/moving existing ones:\n\n* If something goes wrong during the copying process, the old project is still intact and we do not need to update/move it's relations back. This does mean updating all of the services listed in [Projects::OverwriteProjectService#move_before_destroy_relationships](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/89a365dd2f50a258573d5d51907b184e8ffacb4c/app/services/projects/overwrite_project_service.rb#L54-L59)\n* If something goes wrong during old project removal, old project is also intact, we just need to clean up/remove new project\n\nside note: I don't fully understand right now by just looking at the code what happens with new project when old one is failed to be deleted/renamed (it might be removed elsewhere). We attempt to [restore the repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/89a365dd2f50a258573d5d51907b184e8ffacb4c/app/services/projects/overwrite_project_service.rb#L77-L77), but what about all other data? Can data loss potentially happen already?\n\nAdditionally, we [log any exceptions of this service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/89a365dd2f50a258573d5d51907b184e8ffacb4c/app/services/projects/overwrite_project_service.rb#L44) but I haven't seen any occurrences of this in the past 7 days on production (that's how far our logs go).\n\n\n### Solution\n\nIn terms of the solution, I think we should:\n\n1. Update all the relation 'move' services to perform a copy instead\n1. Update `Projects::OverwriteProjectService#destroy_old_project` to not be in `Project.transaction`\n1. If something goes wrong during old project destroy - remove previously copied relations, to match existing behaviour\n1. If something goes wrong during new project rename - remove previously copied relations, to match existing behaviour\n\n:five: for the estimation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-25T08:50:30.895Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T21:25:12.708Z","closed_at":"2022-02-10T10:28:08.761Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Next Up","auto updated","ci-decomposition","ci-decomposition::phase4","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","milestone::p1","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":3944199,"username":"fzimmer","name":"Fabian Zimmer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3944199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fzimmer"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351084","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351084","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351084/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351084/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351084","relative":"#351084","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351084"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6374,"epic":{"id":309456,"iid":6374,"title":"Decomposition: Make Dev features compatible with Decomposed CI database","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6374","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101194263,"iid":351073,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `publish_project_deleted_event`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the fix for namespace statistics refresh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342049) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `publish_project_deleted_event` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::testing\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_testing`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @alberts-gitlab \n- PM: @jreporter \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe the expected outcome when rolling out this feature --\u003e\n\nWhen a project is deleted, the namespace's usage statistics is immediately updated.

What/Why\n\n~\"found:staging.gitlab.com\" \n\nThere seems to be an issue with the `GlPopover` in [geo_node_verification_info.vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/geo_nodes/components/details/primary_node/geo_node_verification_info.vue#L52-59).  When you collapse a Site card it will dump an error to the console about not being able to find the `$el`.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to the Geo Sites Dashboard\n2. Open your dev console\n3. Collapse a Site Card\n4. Note the console.error\n\n## Screenshots\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003econsole.error from Staging\u003c/summary\u003e\n![Staging](/uploads/675813ea77c0af7917491f2fa09e5e79/Staging.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003econsole.error from GDK\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n![GDK](/uploads/07aba5f1d2be92f6ab12480279515839/GDK.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## What do we do\n\nWhen you collapse the component the popover is still trying to keep itself mounted but loses the element it is listening to behind a `v-if`.  There is likely a better way to find our target element that won't break when it is hidden.  This doesn't cause the popover to stop working as when you uncollapse the site card it will continue to show up.  Also noting we have other `GlPopover` usages in this scope that aren't erroring.  This could be a good place to look for if we are doing something wrong/different on this one.\n\n**note:** Since this is only a console error and not a UI issue it hasn't been reported and been around for nearly a year.  This is a low priority but would be nice to fix to not cause any \"red herrings\" for our support engineers if they end up debugging a real UI problem.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-24T21:26:29.867Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T19:37:28.527Z","closed_at":"2022-05-16T19:37:28.509Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"labels":["Geo Administration","SUS::Impacting","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::systems","found:staging.gitlab.com","frontend","geo::planning","group::geo","priority::4","section::enablement","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This will help ensure that uniqueness can be determined when evaluating results of a vulnerability check. This is achieved by using explicit bindings to variables defined in a uniqueness definition template.\n\nAn error should be thrown in the event that a variable declared in the uniqueness template has no definition. There should never be a need to call the `Matches` method more than once on a matcher.\n\n### Example\n\nFor the following uniqueness template, the variable `cookie_name` is defined. The value for `cookie_name` would be the result of all values populated by a matcher with the `CookieName` placeholder.\n\nYAML:\n```yaml\nreport_uniqueness:\n    template: \"missing-http-only{cookie_name}\"\n```\n\nMatcher:\n```go\nfunc (matcher *CookieAttributeMatcher) Matches(_ *browserk.HTTPRequest, _ *browserk.HTTPResponse, cookies []*browserk.Cookie) *MatchResult {\n    ...\n    return Matched(browserk.PlaceholderCookieName, cookie.Name)\n}\n```\n\n## Potential Issues\n\n#### Multiple values for the same name\n\nIn the event that there are two `Cookie` `Matchers` used, both which match, then there will be multiple values with different names. Suggested solution is to use a concatenation of all values.\n\nFor example, it is plausible that both cookie matchers could match:\n\n```yaml\nmatch:\n  type: \"or-condition\"\n  conditions:\n    - type: \"match\"\n      location: \"cookie_name\"\n      expression: \"session_id\"\n    - type: \"match\"\n      location: \"cookie_attribute\"\n      expression: \"[hH]ttp[oO]nly\"\n```\n\n#### Matchers that exit early on success will not populate all values\n\nThe [OrMatcher](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/blob/c2154144d142190387229f21c111634301295046/scanner/plugin/vulnerabilities/http_message_matcher/or_matcher.go#L22) returns `true/Matched` as soon as it processes a matcher that is matched. This will need to change to always execute all matchers, else some matched values will not be populated for those matchers.\n\n```go\nfor _, matcher := range or.matchers {\n    if result := matcher.Matches(request, response, cookies); result.Match {\n        return Matched(result.MatchedValues...)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, the [ResponseHeaderValueMatcher](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/blob/main/scanner/plugin/vulnerabilities/http_message_matcher/response_header_value_matcher.go) will need to process all headers, instead of returning on the first successfully matched header. Headers can be returned in different orders from servers/the browser, hence this could lead to non-deterministic results if we use the header name/value in the uniqueness template.\n\n```go\nif matched, _ := matcher.matchesValue(val); matched {\n    return Matched(val)\n}\n```\n\nThere are other matchers with similar problems.\n\n#### What value should each matcher save?\n\nCurrently, the `CookieAttributeMatcher` saves the entire cookie value. Should this save `cookie_name`, `cookie_value`, or `cookie`? Or should it save values for all three?\n\nFor example, the `16.4` check uses `response_header_value` in the template but checks for `response_header_name`.\n```yaml\nreport_uniqueness:\n  template: \"{request_path_excluding_last_segment}{response_header_value}x-backend-server\"\nmatch:\n  type: \"match\"\n  location: \"response_header_name\"\n  expression: \"[xX]-[bB]ackend-[sServer]\"\n```\n\n#### Values from matched results vs values from requests/responses\n\nIt is plausible that a uniqueness template could have a value like `{request_method}`. Request method could be obtained directly from the `HTTPRequest`, or it could be obtained from the result of a `RequestValueMatcher`. Suggest that we first look for the result from the matcher, and then look in the request.\n\nThat way the `{request_method}` value in the template could be used even when the `RequestValueMatcher` is not used as a matcher. Maybe this isn't necessary, this decision can always be made later when more information may provide more clarity on the best approach.\n\n## An alternative approach\n\nIt could be that named matchers are more useful, for example:\n\n```yaml\nreport_uniqueness:\n  template: \"{request_path_excluding_last_segment}{backend_server_header}x-backend-server\"\nmatch:\n  name: \"backend_server_header\"\n  type: \"match\"\n  location: \"response_header_name\"\n  expression: \"[xX]-[bB]ackend-[sServer]\"\n```\n\nHowever, when adding named variable to the match result, it still isn't clear whether the header name, value or both should be added as the value. It might be prudent to add something like `{backend_server_header:name}` as the template variable.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nWe're moving ahead with the alternative approach.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab enforce_security_report_validation true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss enforce_security_report_validation true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com enforce_security_report_validation true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org enforce_security_report_validation true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com enforce_security_report_validation true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e enforce_security_report_validation true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set enforce_security_report_validation \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set enforce_security_report_validation \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set enforce_security_report_validation true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `enforce_security_report_validation`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set enforce_security_report_validation false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-24T14:40:32.578Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T08:02:12.695Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T03:41:55.860Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["backend","feature flag","feature::addition","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"}],"author":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351000","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":37,"completed_count":6},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 37 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351000","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351000/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351000/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351000","relative":"#351000","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351000"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6968,"epic":{"id":374803,"iid":6968,"title":"Enforce validation of security reports","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6968","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101152889,"iid":350999,"project_id":278964,"title":"Deprecate use of members API for invite modal in favor of invitations API","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently when inviting someone to be a member in the invite modal, we make 2 calls to the API\n\n1. `/members` with invites that are to current users.\n1. `/invitations` with invites that are to emails(not current users).\n\nEach endpoint responds differently when encountering an error.\n\nThis causes downstream issues in response codes and how errors are handled in the response. \n- `invitations` endpoint provides a json object with each `email` being a key in a hash.\n- `members` endpoint provides a json object with each `user` being an element of an array.\n\nThis isn't sustainable and will only cause more issues when trying to deal with errors in the display and also extending.\n\n## Solution\n\n- [x] Ensure the error responses and status codes are the same when submitting emails or users from the invite modal.\n   -

Extend specs to check for the file presence on disk and that the versions declared match the ones that are supported/deprecated\n\n## Things to consider if the implementation plan doesn't scale well enough\n\nIn the scenario when we have a big number of schemas to deprecate and support we might have to consider a different approach on how to maintain the list of schemas:\n\n1. Split the schema files into `deprecated/*.json` and `supported/*.json` and have the model automatically populate the values\n1. Create a Rake task to generate the constants (similar to GraphQL docs)\n1. Resolve dependency versions using (in)equality operators\n\n## Testing\n\n- Ensure the spec contains validations for supported version, deprecated version and unsupported version for each analyser

This will help us answer https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com-top-initiatives/free-saas/-/issues/52 (internal only).\n\n### Solution\n\nThe only way to accomplish this in the short/mid-term is to infer the type of client through the type of authentication used for the container registry. **It's important to note that this won't apply to unauthenticated requests (when downloading public images without a preceding login), but this is the best we can do for now.**\n\nGiven that authentication for the registry is provided by GitLab Rails, a solution requires the following steps:\n\n1. **Rails:** When receiving an authentication request for the container registry (`/jwt/auth` endpoint):\n\n   1. Determine the type of auth credentials provided in the request. For the container registry, the relevant types of auth are CI/build tokens (runners), PAT, deploy tokens, and GitLab/LDAP credentials.\n\n   1. Based on the above information, when emitting the corresponding JWT token, embed a metadata field within `meta` (a new JSON object that we can use to aggregate any metadata fields embedded in JWT tokens from now on) to identify the type of authentication. The key of this attribute should be `auth_type` and the value should be one of `build`, `ci`, `personal_access_token`, `deploy_token`, and `gitlab_or_ldap`.\n\n      These values match the ones used internally in Rails, and can be read from the `type` attribute of the [`Gitlab::Auth::Result`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d5227355ad4f67418c1d706bb4b46383b073f772/lib/gitlab/auth/result.rb#L11) instance. This instance is built within the [`JwtController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d5227355ad4f67418c1d706bb4b46383b073f772/app/controllers/jwt_controller.rb#L34). It should be noted that when calling the `Auth::ContainerRegistryAuthenticationService` in the `JwtController` ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d5227355ad4f67418c1d706bb4b46383b073f772/app/controllers/jwt_controller.rb#L22)), we currently only pass the `project` and `authentication_abilities` properties of the `Gitlab::Auth::Result` instance, we don't pass the instance itself (or the `type` attribute). So this must change in order to read (or receive) the `type` of authentication in `Auth::ContainerRegistryAuthenticationService` (where JWT tokens are generated).\n\n1. **Container Registry:** For every inbound request with a valid authentication token:\n   1. Parse the `meta.auth_type` attribute within the JWT token (if any);\n   1. Inject the auth type key/value pair in the request-scoped context;\n   1. Log the auth type in all request-scoped log entries. The `blob downloaded` and `new blob uploaded` log entries are the more important ones for the purpose of this issue, but it doesn't hurt to include it in all log entries.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-21T16:09:43.469Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T13:50:05.042Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T14:12:49.603Z","closed_by":{"id":12647344,"username":"suleimiahmed","name":"Suleimi Ahmed","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12647344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/suleimiahmed"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Package:P1","auto updated","backend","devops::package","golang","group::container registry","instrumentation","rails","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::staging"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":12647344,"username":"suleimiahmed","name":"Suleimi Ahmed","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12647344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/suleimiahmed"}],"author":{"id":926632,"username":"joshlambert","name":"Joshua Lambert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0bdc5209b11e9c0953f80234dcb4ffb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/joshlambert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":12647344,"username":"suleimiahmed","name":"Suleimi Ahmed","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12647344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/suleimiahmed"},"user_notes_count":75,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350880","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350880","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350880/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350880/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#350880","relative":"#350880","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#350880"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101034522,"iid":350851,"project_id":278964,"title":"Advanced Search: Collect code search snippets and expected hits","description":"### Overview \n\nIt's important to establish testing first in resolving occurrences that are related to characters and searches that aren't working.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-21T00:34:10.809Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T13:11:36.910Z","closed_at":"2022-02-22T02:49:25.554Z","closed_by":{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie

creating reports for our analyzers. [report@v2.0.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/-/blob/v2.0.0/version.go#L10-19) used schema version 3.0.0 while [report@v2.1.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/-/blob/v2.1.0/version.go#L10-19) uses schema version 14.0.0. Therefore, we need to double check the following for each project:\n\n* Analyzer uses report dependency version 2.1.0 or newer.\n* Analyzer uses the report dependency to create the report (it used to be the [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/) dep)\n\nI will create a comment below for each analyzer as I check them off with a link to the comment in this description.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-20T21:33:03.061Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T01:30:24.736Z","closed_at":"2022-02-09T21:46:20.117Z","closed_by":{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Category:Secret Detection","backend","devops::secure","feature::enhancement","group::static analysis","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"}],"author":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350814","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":16,"completed_count":16},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"16 of 16 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350814","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350814/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350814/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#350814","relative":"#350814","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#350814"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7201,"epic":{"id":397087,"iid":7201,"title":"15.0 Deprecations and Removals Work -

In particular the `handleMergeButtonClick` method. This method is doing a lot. It has a lot of state checks going on to determine if confirmation modals need to be shown and other conditionals etc. I think we should abstract some of these checks.\n\nWe also have other lower level components that call this method with different parameters which could lead to regressions. A spike might be useful here to come up with a few different proposals. \n\n### Proposal\n\nI think a good first step to reducing the complexity would be instead of using a single merge button, we could use multiple merge buttons with an explicit method for each one. To keep the logic contained and less room for regressions.\n\n#### Proposal updates\n\n- **2022-06-10:** The team [needs more time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350804#note_985738899) to refine this and decompose it into smaller issues deployed behind a feature flag and will do that during %\"15.2\". One of those issues (empty feature flag?) may be pulled back into the %\"15.2\" milestone to move this forward.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-20T20:16:16.555Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T18:29:03.359Z","closed_at":"2022-07-21T18:29:03.342Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton

Drawer gets a list of included files which will open in a new tab (the file will open in file view in the repo).\n1. The `.gitlab-ci.yml` would be highlighted as the currently open file (it won't be clickable as it's already open in the pipeline editor).\n1. The other pipeline files will show an external link icon on hover.\n1. The file names should be truncated after a certain number of characters, like we do in the [MRs file tree.](https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQu7J4v4) When a file name is truncated, we should show the full file name in a system tooltip on hover (same behavior as in the MRs file tree).\n1. When project has a simple one-file pipeline, we'll show a notification inside the files section explaining that pipeline files will appear here.\n1. When project doesn't have a pipeline file yet (for example, when you haven't committed the `.gitlab-ci.yml` yet), we won't show the file tree section and the file tree button. We will show the button and the file tree once you commit the file.\n1.

The attacker creates a private Gitlab Pages site at the root of their user page `attacker.gitlab.io`, ensuring that the project is `private to collaborators` for Gitlab Pages visibility.   \n2. The attacker invites the victim to collaborate to the project, thus giving them access to the private Pages site.  \n3. The victim clicks on a link to `attacker.gitlab.io`, and a service worker is registered for the domain, passing through all requests back to the server except the `/auth` endpoint, which it intercepts.\n\n**Bypassing the CSRF protection (OAuth2 `state` param)**  \n4. A script on the website requests a valid session cookie and redirection URL from an attacker controlled website.  \n5. The attacker controlled website sends its own request to `attacker.gitlab.io`, and retrieves a redirection URL and a session cookie.  \n6. A script on the website redirects the victim to the redirection URL retrieved by the attacker, and the user authenticates (since the user is already logged in, this does not require any kind of interaction)\n\n**Intercepting the OAuth2 Response**  \n7. The OAuth2 service redirects the user back to `attacker.gitlab.io/auth` with the code and state, which is intercepted by the attacker's service worker and sent to the attacker controlled website.  \n8. The attacker controlled website sends a request to the auth endpoint with the original session cookie and the intercepted code and state to obtain an authenticated session cookie.  \n9. The attacker can use this cookie to access other GitLab Pages sites that the victim has access to.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce  \n1. Create an attacker account and victim account. The victim account should have access to a private GitLab Pages site that the attacker does not have access to.  \n2. Start the attacker controlled server (ensure that it is on a remote server with HTTPS)  \n3. Import the Proof of Concept repository into the attacker's account, rename it to `{attacker username}.gitlab.io` and change the attacker server to the server deployed in step 2.  \n4. Invite the victim to collaborate on the `{attacker username}.gitlab.io` project.  \n5. While logged into the victim account, visit `{attacker username}.gitlab.io`.  \n6. The attacker controlled server will output a valid `gitlab-pages` session cookie, which can be inserted into a browser or curl command (`curl -v --cookie '{cookie}' https://{victim username}.gitlab.io/{private Gitlab Pages project}`) to gain access to the private Gitlab Pages project on the victim's account.\n\n#####  Examples\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\n\nPages Project export: [2022-01-02_21-40-801_dotchinavideo_dotchinavideo.gi_export.tar.gz](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c0bb7ff4-57b3-4a7d-a84c-d66f41ac006a/2022-01-02_21-40-801_dotchinavideo_dotchinavideo.gi_export.tar.gz)  \nPages Project on gitlab.com: https://gitlab.com/dotchinavideo/dotchinavideo.gitlab.io  \nAttacker controlled server: [app.py](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1586b70b-30fd-4a30-a0e1-df8c01c27f2d/app.py) (requires `flask` and `flask-cors` installed, outputs the stolen token to stdout)\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nThe current behavior is that `gitlab-pages` session cookies are not properly validated to ensure that the requested subdomain is the same as the subdomain to which the session cookie was issued for.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nThe expected behavior is for each `gitlab-pages` session cookie be validated to prevent cross-subdomain usage.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots  \n[exploit.mp4](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/9c4cf962-eb14-4966-9871-a548efe954cc/exploit.mp4)\n\n#####  Output of checks  \nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info  \nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nOnce an attacker has a valid Pages session token, they are able to access every private Gitlab Pages site that the victim has access to.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [app.py](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1586b70b-30fd-4a30-a0e1-df8c01c27f2d/app.py)\n* [exploit.mp4](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/9c4cf962-eb14-4966-9871-a548efe954cc/exploit.mp4)\n* [2022-01-02_21-40-801_dotchinavideo_dotchinavideo.gi_export.tar.gz](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c0bb7ff4-57b3-4a7d-a84c-d66f41ac006a/2022-01-02_21-40-801_dotchinavideo_dotchinavideo.gi_export.tar.gz)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-19T22:40:29.763Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T15:03:36.028Z","closed_at":"2022-04-01T07:56:51.394Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Pages","HackerOne","Next Up","Release::P1","Weakness::CWE-285","bug::vulnerability","devops::release","group::release","keep confidential","priority::3","section::ops","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::awaiting security release"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-03-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350687","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350687","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350687/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350687/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#350687","relative":"#350687","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#350687"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":100941072,"iid":350682,"project_id":278964,"title":"Breaking change: Update API permissions for Package settings to Maintainer/Owner","description":"### Context\n\nThe GitLab Package stage offers a Package Registry, Container Registry, and Dependency Proxy to help you manage all of your dependencies using GitLab.

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing?

For example, the successful rows in the screenshot have `NULL` in `finished_at` column. This should have been removed. =\u003e This is done.\n- [x] Until recently, deployments that created by API didn't set `finished_at`. This bug doesn't exist today, but old rows would still be empty even though it's `success` state. We need to [backfill the `finished_at` again](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/22380/diffs#f6c233b58907ad8841c5a4f85c7c9dc22647ca60_0_3). - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85952/diffs\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

For example, can we do an http request during a `before_transition`?

Determining what parts of a git history to scan is not a straight forward task. Currently, the vendored template uses this [script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml#L32-45) to prepare the git repo and git ranges. \n# \nThere are 4 scenarios we should cover to make sure if secrets do get pushed, they are caught immediately.\n\n#### 1. Push events \n1 or more commits can be associated with a push event. Example of this would be if you are working on a feature branch and commit 5 changes to that branch _then_ push the branch. The Secret Detection job that gets triggered by the push event should scan _only_ those 5 commits. The commits associated with the MR can be retrieved by using `CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA` and `CI_COMMIT_SHA`.\n\n#### 2. Merge events\nMerge events can have multiple push events associated with the event. This means retrieving the git of commits is not as straight forward and requires some form of `git log targetBranch..CIBranch` to determine the commit range.\n\n#### 3. Full History Scans\nSome users may want to scan the entire history of their repo on all branches. This is gitleaks default behavior and is supported by the `SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN` variable.\n\n#### 4. NoGit Scans\nUsers may want to scan the current state of their repo for secrets. This means treating repos as plain directories and scanning the contents of files for secrets. This is the current default behavior if no options are passed to the secret detection scanner.\n# \n\nThe git depth is set to 20 for shallow clones in Gitlab pipelines. Secret Detection overrides this and instead fetches the _entire history_ of `$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH` and `$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`. This can cause some performance issues for large repos as fetching the full history of a repo is an expensive task. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78321 introduces some changes that make `--depth` dynamic when fetching. This should give us full coverage so that all commits being pushed to Gitlab are scanned _and_ this should greatly reduce the time of secret detection jobs for large repos since we are only fetching what we need.\n\n# \n@plafoucriere and @dsearles brought up some good points when reviewing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/96577 saying we should move the `script` logic from the vendored template to the Secret Detection analyzer. I think this would be a worthwhile change for the following reasons:\n\n1. Error handling: if an error pops up during a `git fetch` or `git log` we can handle the errors and log a useful message which would help with maintaining and debugging the analyzer. This would also help customers and support. \n2. All Secret Detection logic tied to one release operation. Instead of updating the Secret Detection analyzer AND vendored template, we would just have to update the analyzer. This would eliminate the dance between vendored template changes and analyzer releases that we are currently doing.\n\n#### Proposal\nMove the vendored template `script` logic _into_ the Secret Detection analyzer","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-18T16:52:42.187Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T11:42:17.852Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T15:26:18.558Z","closed_by":{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"},"labels":["Category:Secret Detection","devops::secure","feature::enhancement","group::static analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"}],"author":{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350573","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350573","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350573/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/350573/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#350573","relative":"#350573","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#350573"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
