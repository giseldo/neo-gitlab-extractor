This way we can import notes preserving threading and we ensure a first note with a new discussion id is actually a first note for that thread. Original suggestion can be found in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55769#note_535674698\n\nIn this issue, we will implement the migration of Epic **comments** (notes).\n\n* All comments for each epic should be migrated (including nested responses).\n* Comments should be associated with the importer user OR with original user if its public email is available and user was found by such email\n* Comment award emojis are **not** included in this issue - a separate issue was created for [comment award emojis](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297467)\n\n* GraphQL query:\n```graphql\nquery getEpicNotes($full_path: ID!, $epic_iid: ID!, $cursor: String) {\n  group(fullPath: $full_path) {\n    epics(iid: $epic_iid) {\n      nodes {\n        webUrl\n        notes(first: 100, after: $cursor) {\n          page_info: pageInfo {\n            has_next_page: hasNextPage\n            end_cursor: endCursor\n          }\n          nodes {\n            body\n            confidential\n            system\n            system_note_icon_name: systemNoteIconName\n            created_at: createdAt\n            updated_at: updatedAt\n            resolvable\n            resolved\n            resolved_at: resolvedAt\n            resolved_by: resolvedBy {\n              public_email: publicEmail\n            }\n            author {\n              public_email: publicEmail\n            }\n            discussion {\n              id\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Use https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53747 as reference for the nested pagination (For each epic, we need to fetch 1 or many pages of notes)\n* Discussion ids are exposed as GlobalID, like `\"gid://gitlab/Discussion/a41e4f32accc8cacb6044c21674a7b72b47c71d8\"`, to parse:\n```console\n[dev](main)\u003e GlobalID.parse(\"gid://gitlab/Discussion/a41e4f32accc8cacb6044c21674a7b72b47c71d8\").model_id\n=\u003e \"a41e4f32accc8cacb6044c21674a7b72b47c71d8\"\n```\n* Use the `Pipeline::Context#extra` field to map old discussion ids to the new ones, like:\n\n1. In the transformer\n```ruby\ndef replace_discussion_id(context, data)\n  original_discussion_id = data.delete['discussion_id']\n\n  if context.extra[:discussion_id_map][original_discussion_id] \n    # if discussion_id already map, some note for this discussion was already imported\n    # this way, we keep the discussion mapped.\n    data['discussion_id'] = context.extra[:discussion_id_map][original_discussion_id]\n  else \n    # if there's no context.extra[:discussion_id_map][original_discussion_id], so it's the first note in the discussion\n    # pass it in the `original_discussion_id` key to be mapped in the loader\n    data['original_discussion_id'] = original_discussion_id\n  end\n\n  data\nend\n```\n\n2. In the loader:\n```ruby\ndef load(context, data)\n  original_discussion_id = data.delete['original_discussion_id']\n\n  note = # ... create the note(data)\n\n  if original_discussion_id\n    # this value will only exist for the first note of this discussion\n    context.extra[:discussion_id_map][original_discussion_id] = note.discussion_id\n  end\nend\n```\n\n# Documentation\n* User docs: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/ ([WIP](https://docs.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292107)) \n* Dev docs: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/bulk_import.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-13T00:11:26.127Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:16:58.222Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T09:35:03.927Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Deliverable","GitLab Core","Importer:GitLab Migration","Next Up","backend","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","feature::enhancement","group::import","milestone::p2","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","missed:13.11","missed:13.12","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297464","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297464","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297464/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297464/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297464","relative":"#297464","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297464"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5189,"epic":{"id":179639,"iid":5189,"title":"Group Migration - Complete Epics","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5189","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77126973,"iid":297463,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display a warning if users do not have Agent K configured","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n- Users are currently able to add Alerts to a policy even if they do not have AgentK or KAS installed and enabled for the project.

managing incidents on boards","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Problem\n\nAs part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297594, we discovered that people managing incidents in boards were struggling with the following:\n\n* It's difficult to surface (and/or visualize) priority and severity in boards\n* It's difficult to access \"frequently filtered views\" (other than through creating bookmarks)\n* It's difficult to see what's new on boards\n\nThis issue will be for digging into these difficulties further and ideating on solutions for them.\n\n### Outcome\n\n### Short-term items (ideas that seemed to be the most robust and immediately actionable)\n\n* Adding severity as a filter item (only displaying it as an option if severity is being used by an issue on the Board)\n* Adding severity as a \"group by\" option (only displaying it as an option if severity is being used by an issue on the Board)\n* Saved searches\n\n### Longer-term item (ideas that need further consideration before they are actionable)\n\n* List sorting + global sorting options for boards\n* View options for boards\n* Allow each issue type to design its own \"card\" view\n* Support additional filter inputs like time + additional operators like `is between` (this would help surface new incidents in the list)\n\nWe will continue collaborating on the short-term items in the following issues:\n\n- Saved searches: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14512\n- Severity as a filter item: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322768\n- Severity as a group-by item: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322777\n\n[Figma

More can be read here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254409#note_482784426\n\nWe also are wanting to add enhancements to the dropdown here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284139\n\n## Why\n\nThe root cause of the bug seems to be missing event handlers in the deprecated component.  Adding a fix to a deprecated component seems like a poor use of time since we should be moving away from it when possible.  Since the bug is pretty niche and we also have enhancements to the component already slotted.  I felt that going ahead and replacing the component with Pajama's [GlDropdown](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-dropdown--default) seems like the best approach.  We can hit a _few birds with one stone_ by doing so.\n\n## How\n\nMy recommendation is to do this iteratively behind a feature flag so we can be sure to regression in production as well as be sure that all the existing functionality makes it over into the updated component.\n\nProposed Feature Flag - (`:global-search-updated-dropdown`)\u003cbr /\u003e\nFile to be replaced: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/search_autocomplete.js\n\n\n### Release Notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the customer symptom we are improving? How does the customer understand the problem? --\u003e\n\nPreviously the Header Search located on almost every page in GitLab has existed with several missing features, especially when it comes to Accessibility (A11y).  You may have noticed issues such as the tab and arrow keys both focusing different options in the header search.  There was also zero Screen Reader support making it impossible for users to navigate it without sight.  Finally there was the rare issue where the legacy architecture made it so the header search didn't work at all and left the user without any visual cues.\n\n\u003c!-- What will the customer see, how will they experience the change? --\u003e\n\nWhen using the new and improved Header Search you will immediately notice the proper keyboard functionality.  You will be able to properly navigate the Header and Search with your tab and arrow keys.  Additionally there is now full Screen Reader support allowing for navigation without any visual cues.  Along with this we have added numerous performance increases through our up to date component architecture.  This new architecture will allow for more exciting functionality to be added in the near future!\n\n\u003c!-- Optional - What does the customer need to do to enable this feature --\u003e \n\nIn the coming days CE customers will begin to see the new search live on GitLab.com.  EE customers will have to wait a bit for a full release but can activate it now with the instance feature flag `:new_header_search`\n\n\u003c!-- .doc link to the referencing documentation. --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Image that will be used in the Release post --\u003e\n\n| Empty Search | W/ Search | A11y Demo |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Default_Searches](/uploads/6f978bd3f475fe4f8530d4774e2f6c8f/Default_Searches.png) | ![W__Search](/uploads/f114cf0152e5cf46a32f3db1889dce1a/W__Search.png) | ![A11y_Support](/uploads/ed850a2db3f68a161e78f796d87dbaad/A11y_Support.mp4) |","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-12T16:28:17.195Z","updated_at":"2022-06-18T18:33:29.766Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T15:16:36.058Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","SUS::Impacting","accessibility","devops::data_stores","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::global search","javascript","maintenance::refactor","missed:14.2","missed:14.3","section::enablement","severity::2","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

and document a workflow to deal with feature-flagged GraphQL queries \u0026 mutations","description":"With the recent introduction of the [`graphql-verify`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/04044a0964e8dc8fee4dfa2d505b37d75939d9ce/.gitlab/ci/graphql.gitlab-ci.yml) CI job via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50655, it is no longer possible to ship GraphQL queries/mutations that don't have a corresponding schema definition in the ~backend.\n\nThis potentially affects ~frontend development workflows as it was previously possible for the ~frontend to be built ahead of the ~backend by shipping non-functional queries and mutations behind feature flags while the ~backend caught up.\n\n* What would be an adequate workflow to deal with this kind of situations from now on?\n* Can we document some guidelines in our development docs?\n\nThere a few possible approaches going forward:\n\n## 1. Add the `.graphql` files to the list of known failures\n\nIt is possible to add invalid GraphQL files to a list of known failures in [`config/known_invalid_graphql_queries.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5baab5102304ab98af6a5c85714af3f83f9533bb/config/known_invalid_graphql_queries.yml). This works very much like an `.eslintignore` and allows for bypassing validation on specific files. This is an easy way to temporarily skip validation while the ~backend is being worked on, and we simply need to update the file again to re-enable validation at the end of the implementation.\n\n### Pros\n\n* Easiest solution, almost no overhead.\n* Declarative - the query is marked as invalid because it is.\n\n### Cons\n\n* Need to track the removal from the override when the ~backend is ready. (if we make the known-failure list stricter and flag unnecessary entries this overhead can be removed)\n\n## 2. Define a basic ~backend schema early in the implementation\n\nThis approach would involve defining the ~backend schema early in the implementation, so that any client-side queries/mutations would immediately be considered valid. The schema wouldn't necessarily have to be done right from the get-go, it could simply define a few nullable fields, the bare minimum to support the ~frontend.\n\n### Pros\n\n* _If_ the schema is well defined early in the process, this solution doesn't require any cleanup step towards the end of the implementation.\n\n### Cons\n\n* Adds the most overhead and can delay ~frontend as this step needs to be done before any GraphQL file can be merged.\n\n## 3. Temporarily use the `@client` directive\n\nGraphQL queries and mutations that have the `@client` directive are not validated as those would be handled by client-side resolvers. We could choose to initially ship GraphQL changes with the `@client` directive, and remove it once the ~backend is ready. Additionally, we could also ship the changes along with client-side resolvers to mock API responses. This means shipping faked-out (feature-flagged) features, which can be useful for PMs and Product Designers to test them in staging and production.\n\n### Pros\n\n* Ability to ship mocked resolvers to demonstrate the features in live environments.\n\n### Cons\n\n* Requires a cleanup step at the end of the implementation to remove the `@client` directive, and the resolvers if any.\n* Could be confusing - it is impossible to distinguish uses of the `@client` directive used to mean the field is a client-side feature from uses of it to enable faster iteration\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe will document approaches 3 et 1.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-12T13:25:53.705Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T12:43:03.267Z","closed_at":"2021-01-25T12:43:03.219Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["GraphQL","automation:ml","automation:ml wrong","backend","frontend","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"}],"author":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297375","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297375","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297375/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297375/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297375","relative":"#297375","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297375"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77085332,"iid":297370,"project_id":278964,"title":"Persist value stream changes with list of stages","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296832 we will be able to pass an array of stages for the value stream endpoint, this will allow us to persist our changes when creating / editing a value stream\n\n## Relevant links\n* [UI - Create value streams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267536)\n* [UI - Edit existing value streams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267537)\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [ ] Documentation:\n- [ ] Feature flag:\n- [ ] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated.

Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nSince we don't allow Admin access on .com, Group administrators need a good way to view the Last Activity Date of members in their group. Currently, you can sort users by Last Activity, but it doesn't show an actual date of that activity.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add a Last Activity Date field to the Group Member page (being handled via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33457)\n* Add Last Activity Date to the Group Member API \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nI believe the Last Activity Date is currently restricted to the Admin API, but it would make sense to add it to the Group Member API as well.\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIf .com Group Owners are able to view their user's Last Activity Date.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nThis should be a Core feature. Everyone on .com should be able to effectively manage users in their Group.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-11T23:32:21.797Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T19:50:28.464Z","closed_at":"2021-02-02T09:01:56.245Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["#field-fyi","Deliverable","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297291","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297291","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297291/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/297291/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#297291","relative":"#297291","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#297291"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4547,"epic":{"id":121875,"iid":4547,"title":"GitLab.com Billable Members List","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4547","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77053880,"iid":297282,"project_id":278964,"title":"Backend: Able to git the wiki despite of the Only Project Members setting","description":"**[HackerOne report #1075586](https://hackerone.com/reports/1075586)** by `shells3c` on 2021-01-10, assigned to @rchan-gitlab:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nThere was a problem by mistake while confirming the patch for the Wiki bug in the past report: #887755, and the fact that the bug is still there!

Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nGitlab features a [Package Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/index.html) which can be used for public and private repositories.  \nWhen a private repository publishes a Composer package (for private use), the package can be download by the URL, without any authentication. The only requirement is to obtain the dist download link from the composer.lock file\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. [Create a new Private group](https://gitlab.com/groups/new)  \n2. [Create a new Private project](https://gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project) in the newly private group  \n3. Add a default composer.json file to the project / [create a composer package](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/composer_repository/#create-a-composer-package)  \n```  \n{\n    \"name\": \"sjerdo/private-project\"  \n}\n```  \n4. Create a tag, e.g. 1.0.0  \n5. [Create a personal access token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with `api` access.  \n6. [Publish the composer package](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/composer_repository/#publish-a-composer-package-by-using-the-api) using the API and the personal access token  \n7. [Create a blank composer project and install the package](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/composer_repository/#install-a-composer-package)  \n8.

Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n- ...\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Confirm that QA tests pass with the feature flag enabled (if you're unsure how, contact the relevant [stable counterpart in the Quality department](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/#individual-contributors))\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Add changelog entry\n- [x] Remove feature flag\n- [x] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-11T15:31:02.801Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:01:28.463Z","closed_at":"2021-03-24T09:50:51.333Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan

Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [ ] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-08T18:12:48.301Z","updated_at":"2021-06-15T16:48:42.814Z","closed_at":"2021-06-09T16:03:09.384Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","devops::systems","feature flag","frontend","group::geo","section::enablement","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"}],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296986","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":13,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 13 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296986","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296986/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296986/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296986","relative":"#296986","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296986"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4712,"epic":{"id":135048,"iid":4712,"title":"Geo: Implement the new design of the Geo node page","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4712","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 22, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76932447,"iid":296964,"project_id":278964,"title":"Offset-based pagination not working for compare commits api","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nCompare api for commit is not returning response page by page when using Offset-based pagination parameters\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nInvoke endpoint GET /projects/:id/repository/compare to compare two commits that are more than 20 commits apart, and use parameters page=1\u0026per_page=20\n\nExample REST endpoint - \nhttps://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/18/repository/compare?page=1\u0026per_page=20\u0026from=\u003cfrom_commit_sha\u003e\u0026to=\u003cto_commit_sha\u003e\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.

What problem area will you be solving for and who is the target user? --\u003e\n\n## Objectives\n\n\u003c!-- Try to describe the objectives of the Sprint in detail. eg \"We want to introduce a new feature but we are unsure that we are thinking about the solution from the customer's perspective and through the Sprint we want to rethink the solution, prototype it and validate it with our customers\" or \"We are unhappy with the direction of one of our categories and we want to explore new directions with different stakeholders, reach to one solution and test it with users\" or \"Among the team we have different visions for a specific category and we want to work towards a solution we all support and test it with users\".  --\u003e \n\n## Outputs\n\n- [ ] A User testing flow.\n- [ ] A Prototype to be tested with users.\n- [ ] User testing analysis. \n- [ ] (If the solution is viable) An epic or issue that describes the direction in details and the next steps\n- [ ] Necessary updates to the Handbook.\n\n## Design Sprint Details\n\n### WHEN \n\n**Start date:**\n\n**End date:**\n\n**Reference time zone:**\n\n### WHERE\n\n**Zoom link:**\n\n### WHO\n\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Facilitator \n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Decider\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Co-decider (optional)\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Sprint team member\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Sprint team member\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Sprint team member\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Sprint team member\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Sprint team member\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Sprint team member\n   - `Name` `gitlab handle` - Co-facilitator (optional)\n\n## Tools\nHere is the list of tools for the Sprint preparation, collaboration and documentation. Prior to the Sprint make sure you have access to all of the following:\n\n*  **GitLab**\u003cbr/\u003e\nEach Sprint day outcomes and material will be documented in a separate issue under the Design Sprint epic. \n\n* **Mural** (You can join as anonymous but we need to be able to identify input against names, so please create an account beforehand.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWe will use Mural for most of the Sprint collaboration. Some of the things we will do in Mural: create artefacts like affinity diagrams from participants' input, use post-its to comment on each other's points and to add notes, vote on ideas and solutions, create the first draft of the prototype.\nThe Mural link to the collaboration project will be provided in the issue before the start of the Design Sprint.\n\n* **Video and/or screen recording tool** (Loom, Quicktime, Zoom or another tool you are using).\u003cbr/\u003e\nAs part of the pre-Sprint homework, you will be asked to record a short Lightning Walkthrough video. You can use any tool you feel comfortable with that can capture your screen and your audio.\n\n* **A4/Letter sized paper (preferably white blank), Sharpies/Pens** (please don't use a pencil because it doesn't create enough contrast for photos).\u003cbr/\u003e\nDay 2 of the sprint involves some (async) ideation via sketching so you will need a writing utensil (Sharpies are preferred) and some paper. This is the most fun part of the Sprint where you get into a design thinking mindset and can appeal to your creative self. \n\n* **Camera (phone or other) or scanner**\u003cbr/\u003e\nYou will need to upload sketches as images for the facilitator to prepare the material before the next sync meeting. You can take a photo with your phone or use a scanner if available.\n\n* **Post-it notes (Optional)**\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you enjoy taking notes using post-it notes make sure you have available some of them as well. The upside is that they will make you feel more like you are in a workshop and will help the ideas flow (I find that typing is distracting while ideating). The downside is that you will have to digitalise the ones you want to share with the team in Mural.\n\n## Artefacts \u0026 Pre-Read Material\n\n\u003c!-- If there is material that will be useful for the participants to read before the Design Sprint add here. --\u003e\n\n### Handbook pages\n\u003c!-- Add a link to the category vision from the handbook --\u003e\n\n### Competitor resources\n\u003c!-- Add any solutions by competitors that are relevant to the Design Sprint topic and could be used as source of inspiration. --\u003e\n\n\n### Articles on Design Sprints\n  * [The Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/)\n  * [The Ultimate Guide To Remote Design Sprints](https://www.dropbox.com/s/umtqtnwz3cshxh5/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20To%20Remote%20Design%20Sprints.pdf?dl=0)\n\n## Asyncronus tasks\n\n### Design Sprint preparation\n\n\u003c!-- Replace the roles with GitLab handles to assign to specific participants --\u003e\n\n- [ ] Finalise participant list - `decider` and `facilitator`\n- [ ] Create [participation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0_BNltvRW8yXXaJd8sIKzgDmrSGqILMfkoCJrAj6sFcsMcg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and send to participants (**deadline**: [date]) - `facilitator` \n- [ ] Promote this issue to an epic - `facilitator`\n- [ ] Create issues under the epic for the pre-workshop tasks: Expert interviews ([example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/3#note_332412524)), Lightning walkthroughs and How might we.. notetaking assignment ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/52)), Voting How might we... notes assignment ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/54)) - `facilitator` \n- [ ] Create sync meetings in calendar and invite all participants (**deadline**: [date]) - `decider` or `facilitator` \n- [ ] Block 2 hours for Sprint activities in calendar for the Sprint week - `all participants`\n- [ ] Prepare material and tools (eg. presentation templates, Google folders, Instructions videos etc) and Mural board from the [Mural template ](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/gitlab2474/1586990879319?sender=jmandell0210\u0026key=03c25e92-9a43-4a3d-8907-6f0c3b094ab8) - facilitator \n- [ ] Finalize Agenda - `facilitator` \n- [ ] Run a test with material and tools - `facilitator` \n- [ ] Start user recruiting for prototype user testing (EOD 1) - `facilitator` or `decider`\n\n### Pre-Sprint activities (Homework exercises)\n\nEach exercise should be explained and documented in a separate issue.

Steps:\u003cbr/\u003e  Go through the Map and the top voted How might we’s tree as a warm-up/reminder. \u003cbr/\u003e • Make appropriate adjustments and additions to the map based on the reviews from the team. \u003cbr/\u003e • Add the most voted HMWs to the most relevant area on the Map. If a HMW can go to more than one place, add it to the most left area. |\n| Long term goals/Deciding the Sprint goal | 15 mins | Mural  | • Long term goal: Everyone spends 5 minutes in silence and write one (max 2) long term goals for the Sprint. (5 mins ) \u003cbr/\u003e • One by one will then type them in Mural saying the long term goal aloud. (5 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e Everyone besides the decider will vote on the goal of the Sprint (1 dot). (4 minutes) \u003cbr/\u003e The decider then makes the final decision on the long term goal. (1 mins) |\n | Sprint questions | 20 mins | Mural | • Everyone writes down 2-3 Sprint questions for the biggest challenges they think that might stop us from achieving our long term goal. The questions should start with “Can we...” (similarly to the HMW). (7 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • One by one will then type them in Mural reading the Sprint questions aloud. (5 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • Everyone (including the decider) votes on the top 3 questions they think we should focus on as Sprint challenges (3 dots). (5 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • Separate the 3 most voted questions and keep them on the side. (1 min) \u003cbr/\u003e • Finally, the decider chooses one Sprint question that will be the question we will focus on more during the Sprint. (1 min) \u003cbr/\u003e • Write the long term goal and the Sprint questions in a dedicated Mural space, highlighting the ultimate Sprint question that the decider chose. (1 min) |\n| Recap day. \u003cbr/\u003e Short intro to next day and share the video with the next day exercise instructions. | 5 mins | Mural, Zoom | Summarise activities of the day and decisions. Brief walkthrough of the next day's activities and wrap up the day. |\n\n### Day 2\n  |  Activity  | Duration | Tool  | Description  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  Summary of Day 1 outcomes | 5 mins | Mural | Go through the previous day's activities, the Long term goal and the top voted Sprint questions, highlighting the ultimate Sprint question, and summarise the concept solution sketching homework exercise. |\n|  Concept gallery review | 20 mins | Mural | • Everyone takes some time to read through and look at every aspect of each of the sketches in the Concept Gallery. The concept sketches are anonymous to avoid bias (15 mins). \u003cbr/\u003e • The team will then vote on their favorite concepts and/or components of a concept via the red dots. When they see something that interests them and they think it will help solve the problem they can add one or more dots. They can use as many red dots as they want (5 mins).\u003cbr/\u003e Note: If anyone has any questions about a concept sketch create a red sticky and write that question down placing it under the concept sketches. |\n|  Speed critique | 5 mins | Mural | • The facilitator walks through each of the concepts, briefly summarizing each concept (to their ability) with a focus on the areas that have been dotted. \u003cbr/\u003e • When the facilitator believes they’ve reached the end of their summary for that concept, discussion with the team if there was a concept that was voted but not discussed or the point of the red dot voting was missed in the discussion. \u003cbr/\u003eNote:|\n|  Straw Poll | ~15 mins | Mural | • All the participants besides the Decider vote (with their initials) the concept sketch they believe is the best one and will suit the challenges and goal of this sprint and is worthy of being prototyped (2 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • All the participants write down the reasons for choosing the concept. (5 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • Each participant gets 1 minute to sell their preferred concept to the Decider and the other participants. (5-10 mins) |\n| Super Vote (The Decider) | 10 mins | Mural | • The Decider makes their final decision of which of the concepts is the one to move forward with. \u003cbr/\u003e • The decider can discuss their thought process and any questions with the rest of the participants.|\n\n\n### Day 3\n |  Activity  | Duration | Tool  | Description  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| User test flow | 25 mins | Mural | • Each participant writes (on separate stickies) 6 steps/actions that represent a each step of a flow (you can think of a high-level prototype flow) from start to finish. Place them in a column on the User Test board. (10 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • Each participant takes 1 minute to walk the team through the steps one-by-one (5-10 mins). Note: It's better to have the Decider go last. \u003cbr/\u003e • Voting: All the Sprint participants get one red dot (the Decider gets 2) to vote on the flow row they think is the best foundation for the prototype. \u003cbr/\u003e • After everyone has voted the Decider will vote their favourite row with one dot and they can use the second dot to vote for an element of another flow they think should be incorporated in the prototype. (5 mins) \u003cbr/\u003e • If selected, copy this sticky in the flow voted by the Decider. | \n| Storyboard | 45 mins | Mural | • Copy the winning flow from the User Test Flow exercise to the Storyboard/Prototype section. \u003cbr/\u003e • Look at the sketch concepts and move over any relevant screens that fulfill the needs of the sticky note in that container. You can move parts of concepts. \u003cbr/\u003e • Fill in the details that are required for each step described in the sticky. |\n| Recap day | 5 mins | Mural, Zoom | Summarise activities of the day and decisions. Brief walkthrough of the next day's activities and wrap up the day. |\n\n### Day 4\n |  Activity  | Duration | Tool  | Description  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Validate Prototype | 30 mins | Mural | • Go through the Prototype created by the Product designer of Front end developer and discuss any inaccuracies or missing content. |\n| Wrap up the Sprint | 15 mins | Zoom, GitLab | • Recap the Sprint and discuss next steps. Create user testing issues. |\n\n### Day 5\n |  Activity  | Duration | Tool  | Description  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Prototype testing with 5 users | ~45 mins | Figma or code/Zoom | • Test the prototype with users. |\n| Analyse user testing results | ? | ? | • Analyse the results of the user testing sessions, create a report and share with the decider and the other Sprint participants. |\n\n\n## Ground Rules\n*  Honor the Facilitator's directions. They're the guide for the entire process.\n*  Minimise distractions: During the week you will need to dedicate some hours to the Sprint for async tasks and sync video conferences. During this time we recommend blocking time in your calendar and having devices or apps with notifications turned off during that time. \n*  All opinions are valid and are equally important, however, the Decider has the ultimate, final decision.\n*  Everyone is an active participant in a sync activity (with the exception of the Observers).\n*  One conversation at a time.\n*  Document as much as you can: We should have concrete outputs to share with broader team. Also interesting ideas or fixes should be documented to be transferred in issues for our backlog.\n*  Stick to scheduled breaks during sync calls. The Facilitator will guide each session and set break times.\n*  The Sprint is one of the few chances we get to work so closely together.

This temporarily mitigated the problem. This issue is to discuss more mid/long-term optimization vision.\n\n## Why post-processing on Markdown is necessary\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238194#note_480825741\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nBasically, there are two process steps on markdown rendering:\n\n* Pre-processing. When a user inputs `description` filed of `release`, the plain texts will be converted to HTML that will be rendered as Markdown. This converted data will be persisted into database as `description_html`.\n* Post-processing. Re-process the `description_html` when it's provided **for users**. Specifically,\n  * [Redacting confidential issues](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/-/merge_requests/2869)\n  * [Render special references for release entities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26554)\n\nThe key point is that pre-processing doesn't take **user information** into account. The final content of the markdown will *vary per user*. For example, non-project members see the confidential issue as just a plaintext URL, but project members see the issue title on tooltip.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Proposal\n\n* Improve the post-processing facility `MarkupHelper.markdown_field`. There *might* be room for the further optimization (I've not checked the entire implementation).\n* We cache post-processed content into Redis when user accesses the GraphQL query, so the second or latter rendering will be significantly faster. But, since cached data could exist for the number of users, this could pressurize the redis capacity. Also, we have to think we these data should be invalided.\n* We don't post-process `description_html`, but present it directly. We change pre-processing to persist redacted data beforehand. Users can no longer see [any special references](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26554). i.e. sacrificing UX for performance.\n* From @nfriend \n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nAn additional step we could take is updating the frontend to make 2 requests - one request for the first item (which should load quite quickly) and another for items 2-10. I proposed this in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/237946, and at the time we thought it made more sense to try and optimize the API performance, but perhaps it's time to revisit this option :thinking:. I actually think this might be relatively straightforward on the frontend side. I might put together a POC MR once I have some free time.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-08T07:36:35.327Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T10:31:21.163Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T10:31:21.148Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","bug::performance","cicd::planning","devops::release","group::release","section::ops","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

You may have run into a problem with publishing the same version multiple times. For Java packages, you expect to be able to publish duplicate snapshots, but not releases.\n\nWe've addressed this issue by adding a new group setting for the package registry that allows you to choose whether or not you'd like to allow or disallow duplicate Maven or Gradle uploads. By default, duplicates will not be allowed with the exception of snapshots. You can easily adjust this by navigating to your group-\u003esettings-\u003epackages \u0026 registries and enable duplicates or add an exception using a regular expression.\n\nAfter Maven and Gradle, we'll be doing the same for other package manager formats as well. We'll follow the standard set by the public registries.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWhen using the GitLab Package Registry to upload packages, a user can upload the same Maven package name/version multiple times. The newest record will always be served when installing. The older records will only be accessible via the UI or API. This can result in the wrong dependency being installed and can introduce risk into the software development lifecycle.\n\n### Proposal\n\nOffer a setting in the application that will allow Admin to determine if they want to allow or disallow duplicate Maven packages to be published to their registry. By default, duplicate Maven uploads will be allowed. In addition, allow an Admin to add any additional exceptions using regex.\n\nThis can take advantage of the work done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276882, which added a new API endpoint that allows a Developer to set this setting. \n\n### Further details\n\n#### Roll out to other formats\n\nAs part of the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5070, we will be rolling out this setting to other package manager formats over the next several milestones. This issue will focus only on Maven and we will add a note to the documentation that other formats will be done later and link to the epic. \n\n#### Current duplicate behaivor\n\nThis table is a good reference for our current duplicate behavior, and it can be used to determine what the default value should be as we work through adding this setting for each package type.\n\n| Package type | Duplicates allowed? |\n|--------------|---------------------|\n| npm | ❌ |\n| maven | ✅ |\n| NuGet | ✅ |\n| Conan | ✅ |\n| PyPI | ❌ |\n\n### Testing\nAt the end-to-end level tracked in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/1121","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-07T18:25:40.480Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T04:09:17.957Z","closed_at":"2021-02-15T08:24:26.508Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Maven Repository","Package:P1","UX","devops::package","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::package registry","quad-planning::complete-action","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296895","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296895","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296895/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296895/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296895","relative":"#296895","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296895"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5070,"epic":{"id":163365,"iid":5070,"title":"Add a setting to allow/disallow duplicate package uploads","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5070","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":76895127,"iid":296892,"project_id":278964,"title":"Housekeeping is not run on wiki repos, causing performance degradation over time","description":"### Summary\n\nHousekeeping tasks are only run on the project repo, not wikis.

If there is a set of merge requests that can't be cleaned for whatever reason, they'll take up a slot of the 180 \"forever\". Furthermore, if the jobs run way longer (as we've seen in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3288) we could schedule a while bunch of jobs on top of each other, all hitting the same gitaly node.\n\nSo I think we need better control over how many of these jobs we run simultaneously.\n\n### Suggestion: Refactor the  `MergeRequestCleanupRefsWorker` into a [`LimitedCapacity::Worker`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sidekiq_style_guide.html#limited-capacity-worker)\n\nSince the `MergeRequest::CleanupSchedule` is already it's separate table that contains all of the work to be done, we could use a `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` database lock for the worker to find its own work while not getting in the way of others jobs running.\n\nThis does mean that we would need to keep track of the status of a schedule on that row. And we set the status of the row inside the transaction. An example implementation of this is the way we select container registry repositories for clean-up: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/28ae2160d01a69430716f332bfb128b592c26dc8/app/workers/container_expiration_policies/cleanup_container_repository_worker.rb#L80\n\nThat way, we have better control on how many jobs run at the same time, without being surprised if one of the jobs runs longer.\n\nWe could also keep track if a clean-up has failed to many times, to avoid repeating it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-07T14:39:41.628Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T08:58:54.197Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T01:58:44.908Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","backend","bug::availability","corrective action","devops::create","group::code review","infradev","priority::2","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"}],"author":{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296874","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296874","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296874/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296874/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#296874","relative":"#296874","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296874"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":76870229,"iid":296866,"project_id":278964,"title":"Conan API incorrectly processes JWT-encoded Personal Access Tokens, leading to potential vulnerability","description":"**[HackerOne report #1070097](https://hackerone.com/reports/1070097)** by `firelizzard` on 2021-01-02, assigned to @cmaxim:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nThe Conan API incorrectly processes JWT-encoded Personal Access Tokens sent via HTTP Bearer auth. If an attacker is able to determine a server secret (`Settings.attr_encrypted_db_key_base`), a username, and one of the user\u0026#39;s Personal Access Token\u0026#39;s ID, the attacker could access the Conan API as if they had the Personal Access Token secret.\n\nThis may also affect the dependency proxy.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Target a GitLab instance  \n   - You must be able to make API requests  \n1. Determine the instance\u0026#39;s  `Settings.attr_encrypted_db_key_base`  \n   - This must be done via direct access to the server, or some other vulnerability  \n1. Target a user of the instance  \n   - You need the User ID  \n   - If all you know is the username, you can use the GraphQL API to get the ID from the username  \n1. Guess the ID of one of the user\u0026#39;s Personal Access Tokens  \n   - The PAT must have access to the Conan API  \n   - If the instance is small enough, you may be able to brute force this  \n   - If you have an account, you can create your own PAT, which may give you an idea of likely ID ranges to try  \n1. Execute the following script  \n   - You must have the `jwt` gem installed\n\n```ruby  \nrequire \u0026#39;time\u0026#39;  \nrequire \u0026#39;jwt\u0026#39;  \nrequire \u0026#39;securerandom\u0026#39;\n\n###  URL to attack  \nURL = \u0026#39;https://gdk.test/api/v4/packages/conan/v1/users/check_credentials\u0026#39;\n\n###  User ID of your target  \nuser_id = 1\n\n###  Personal Access Token ID of your target user  \ntoken_id = 1\n\n###  Settings.attr_encrypted_db_key_base  \nkey_base = \u0026#39;REDACTED\u0026#39;\n\nissued_at = Time.now  \nnot_before = issued_at - 5  \nexpire_time = issued_at + 60\n\npayload = {  \n    jti: SecureRandom.uuid,  \n    \u0026#34;access_token\u0026#34;: token_id,  \n    \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: user_id,  \n    iat: issued_at.to_i,  \n    nbf: not_before.to_i,  \n    exp: expire_time.to_i  \n}\n\nsecret = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new, key_base, \u0026#39;gitlab-conan-packages\u0026#39;)  \nencoded = JWT.encode(payload, secret, \u0026#39;HS256\u0026#39;, { typ: \u0026#39;JWT\u0026#39; })\n\nputs `curl -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer #{encoded}\u0026#34; #{URL}`  \n```\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAbility to do anything with the Conan API that the target user can do. This includes discovering and downloading Conan packages, as well as uploading new packages.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nThis requires compromising a server secret, `Settings.attr_encrypted_db_key_base`, so I have only tested it on my local GDK setup.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe way the Conan API authentication processes a JWT-encoded Personal Access Token means authentication will succeed if the JWT has the *ID* of the PAT instead of the actual (cryptographically secure and random) token.\n\n`API::Helpers::Packages::Conan::ApiHelpers#find_personal_access_token_from_conan_jwt` on line 248 of `lib/api/helpers/packages/conan/api_helpers.rb` uses `PersonalAccessToken.find_by_id_and_user_id`.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Conan API should only accept a JWT-encoded Personal Access Token if the JWT contains the actual token value.\n\nThe helper should use `PersonalAccessToken.find_by_token_and_user_id`.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nI\u0026#39;m not sure there are any relevant logs.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n```  \n$ cd ~/Source/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab  \n$ bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=development  \nSystem information  \nSystem:  \nProxy:          no  \nCurrent User:   firelizzard  \nUsing RVM:      no  \nRuby Version:   2.7.2p137  \nGem Version:    3.1.4  \nBundler Version:2.1.4  \nRake Version:   13.0.1  \nRedis Version:  6.0.8  \nGit Version:    2.30.0  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.9  \nGo Version:     go1.15.5 darwin/amd64\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:        13.8.0-pre  \nRevision:       f9a79617f8e  \nDirectory:      /Users/firelizzard/Source/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab  \nDB Adapter:     PostgreSQL  \nDB Version:     12.4  \nURL:            https://gdk.test:3443  \nHTTP Clone URL: https://gdk.test:3443/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:  ssh://firelizzard@gdk.test:2222/some-group/some-project.git  \nElasticsearch:  no  \nGeo:            no  \nUsing LDAP:     no  \nUsing Omniauth: yes  \nOmniauth Providers: google_oauth2\n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:        13.15.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default:      /Users/firelizzard/Source/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:              /Users/firelizzard/Source/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab-shell  \nGit:            /usr/local/bin/git  \n```\n\n####  Impact\n\nThe attacker could to do anything with the Conan API that the target user can do.

The XSS exists due to the old version of DOMpurify used in swagger-ui that allows an attacker can  **inject any HTML elements with any attributes** (except script tag) on the page. \n\nThe XSS in POC requires 1 click anywhere on the page to execute, because of CSP that does not allow to execute events from HTML tags. (f.e. \u0026lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1)). I will try to find CSP bypass that will allow me to execute the script with no user interaction.\n\nMy script uses the CSP bypass presented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213273  \n```  \n\u0026lt;a     \n  data-remote=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;  \n  data-method=\u0026#34;get\u0026#34;    \n  data-type=\u0026#34;script\u0026#34;  \n  href=\u0026#34;/wbowling/wiki/raw/master/test.js\u0026#34;   \n  class=\u0026#39;atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select\u0026#39;\u0026gt;  \n\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;    \n```\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://gitlab.com/kannthu/asdasdas123/-/blob/master/openapi.yaml (tested on Chrome and Firefox)  \n2. Click anywhere on the page  \n3. You should see the alert box\n\nThere is another way of executing this XSS. **You can add \u0026#34;url=https://gitlab.com/kannthu/asdasdas123/-/raw/master/openapi.yaml\u0026#34; parameter to the URL of any open API file in any repository, and the XSS will still work**. \n\n1. Open https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/omnibus-mirror/alertmanager/blob/master/api/v2/openapi.yaml?url=https://gitlab.com/kannthu/asdasdas123/-/raw/master/openapi.yaml  \n2.

I believe we can keep the same behaviour when we upgrade to `GlAlert`.\n\n![Screenshot_2021-04-17_at_15.22.42](/uploads/5ed2d50de7200a8e28f47906cf111da0/Screenshot_2021-04-17_at_15.22.42.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-07T08:00:00.639Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T17:16:00.351Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T17:15:53.035Z","closed_by":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::secure","follow-up","frontend","group::threat insights","section::sec","security dashboard","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296847","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296847","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296847/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/296847/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293975"},"references":{"short":"#296847","relative":"#296847","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#296847"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76852428,"iid":296845,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add ActionCable Prometheus metrics","description":"We already added metrics around Action Cable thread pooling and connections, but this is not sufficient to populate a standard service dashboard.\n\nAs part of the [readiness review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/issues/13) for Action Cable, we therefore identified the need to add more standard metrics such as latency, saturation, and error rate. These should feed directly into our SLOs, since real-time updates will be part of the overall webservice experience. The existing [service catalog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/services/service-catalog.yml) is a good reference for how this could be integrated into existing dashboards and alerting rules.\n\nNote that since existing web metrics evolve around the traditional request-response flow of HTTP, with Action Cable this would only cover the initial protocol upgrade request going through the `/-/cable` endpoint. So `RequestsRackMiddleware` is not going to provide enough coverage here. We will have to emit these through other hooks.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296845#note_492016572\n\n- [x] `transmit.action_cable`: A single message transmitted to one client.

Count these with `channel_class` as a label.\n- [x] `transmit_subscription_rejection.action_cable`: Emitted when subscription to a channel is rejected. We don't have any application logic that would reject a connection yet but maybe there are other reasons why this would happen. Count with `channel_class` as a label.\n- [x] `broadcast.action_cable`: Emitted when a broadcast is sent to all subscribers to a stream (source code [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/291a3d2ef29a3842d1156ada7526f4ee60dd2b59/actioncable/lib/action_cable/server/broadcasting.rb#L46)).

Now the user has the opportunity to first remove any sensitive data before finalizing the new issue. This is important because even though issues created from vulnerabilities were automatically set to confidential, the user role required to see a confidential issue is lower (`Reporter` and above) than that required to see a vulnerability (`Developer` and above) so sensitive information could leak.\n\nHowever, with the new behavior, the option to make issues confidential is not selected by default. This increases the potential for information leakage even more broadly than before.\n\n### Proposal \n\nWhen creating a new issue from a vulnerability (or a vulnerability finding), the `This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access.` option/checkbox is selected by default.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo changes.\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdate the issue creation section of https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#vulnerability-report-1 to explicitly mention that new issues created from vulnerabilities will be set to Confidential by default. Also, add a note/tip/caution (whichever documentation style choice is appropriate) that the user should consider removing any sensitive vulnerability details before creating the issue because of permissions disparity between confidential issues (Reporter and above) and vulnerabilities (Developer and above) which can lead to leaking information to under-privileged users.\n\n**Note:** The above may be unnecessary as issues and vulnerabilities is covered in much more detail here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/index.html#interacting-with-the-vulnerabilities\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

Group Wiki data after trial ends or tier is downgraded","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nGroup-level Wikis are available on Premium/Silver and higher plans. If a user downgrades or completes their trial period without purchasing Premium or Ultimate, they lose access to any data stored in a group wiki.\n\n### Proposal \n\nThe data for the group wiki is stored in a separate git repo. This is still on disk after the trial period or downgrade is complete. So, we should provide read-only access to the group wiki repository data through the API, allowing users to package and download it from the command line. \n\n#### But why not do this in the UI\n\nThere are several reasons we would not want to provide read-only access to the group wiki data in the UI. But the primary reason is time investment. This MVC allows access to user data without investing in branching front-end logic and different experiences based on a user's current tier. The proposal to download a wiki repository from the API actually has utility in itself as well.\n\nIn the future, based on demand, we could build on this and provide a way to complete the download through the UI, so this iteration makes the most sense as the smallest possible change to solve the problem.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThis will require step-by-step documentation in the Wiki documentation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-06T15:33:53.892Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T14:19:54.511Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T16:22:21.653Z","closed_by":{"id":5212466,"username":"ericschurter","name":"Eric Schurter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5212466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ericschurter"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","GitLab Core","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
