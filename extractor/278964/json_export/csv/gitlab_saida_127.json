Currently VSA cannot be accessed via the navigation bar, but can be browsed to directly. \n\nWe should eliminate any remaining Instance-level VSA code to correctly reflect this.\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWe are moving analytics features to the group level, this will help clear up any possible confusion on how to access VSA. Additionally, the additional code and tests are starting to impact developing new features.\n\n### Proposal\n* Remove the route and move the controller code/views to the group level\n* Update feature specs and other related tests\n* Remove the group selector from the VSA ~frontend code\n* Update the VSA ~frontend vuex state to remove code related to selecting a group, since the group details are populated via `data-*` attributes from the ~backend\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\nFrom [Slack#g_manage_analytics on 2020-06-17](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJZR6KPB4/p1592449957474000):\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\nekigbo Jun 17th at 8:12 PM\nQuestion, should we still be able to access VSA at the instance level?

(edited) \n\nJohn-Mason Shackelford  4 days ago\n@ekigbo I suggest moving forward with an approach that breaks instance level VSA and see if we get a complaint given that it is inaccessible from the UI but only directly via a URL. (edited) \n\nJeremy  4 days ago\nI have been under the impression that you are generally in favor of moving away from instance level features toward group level given growth of dot-com and ability to nest groups.\nYes, I'm in favor of an approach that lets GitLab.com users benefit from these features. I think instance-level features make this difficult, but I'm certainly open to other ideas. The challenge is making sure that we can use a new feature on both self-managed and GitLab.com, and instance-level things have historically been hard to do that with.

Enable the feature flag: `Feature.enable(:geo_project_registry_ssot_sync)`;\n1. Enable the selective sync on the group level;\n1. Wait for the replication to finish;\n1. Disable the selective sync;\n1. Wait a few minutes;\n1.

In order to do this, we need to ensure that each app is isolated before we can start migrating them each to GraphQL.

It would be cleaner in the code and response if there were a single top-level \"total\" node, as well as the top level \"test_suites\" node.\n\n## Proposal\n\nRefactor `lib/gitlab/ci/reports/test_report_summary.rb` and the frontend that consumes it so that the response instead looks something like:  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": {\n    \"time\": \"x\",\n    \"count\": \"x\",\n    \"success\": \"x\",\n    \"failed\": \"x\",\n    \"errored\": \"x\",\n    \"skipped\": \"x\"\n  }\n  \"test_suites\": ...\n}\n```\n\nSomething to note is we will not be able to reuse existing entities as we would need to create new ones after performing this refactor.\n\n\n## Original Description\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nThe following discussion from !33431 should be addressed:\n\n#### From @ayufan [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33431#note_361363495):  (+5 comments):\n\nDo we need that? Can we just render `total`?\n\n#### From @morefice:\n\nWhat did you have in mind? Something like this?\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total\": {\n    \"time\": \"x\",\n    \"count\": \"x\",\n    \"success\": \"x\",\n    \"failed\": \"x\",\n    \"errored\": \"x\",\n    \"skipped\": \"x\"\n  }\n  \"test_suites\": ...\n}\n```\n\nThis implies a couple of things we need to keep in mind:\n\n1. We will not be able to reuse existing entities as we would need to create new ones\n1. We would need to tweak the ~frontend with this new API\n\n#### From @ayufan:\n\nYes, this would be preferred. For ~frontend the usage of `total:` should be a very minimal change. Can you try to do it in next MR and fix ~frontend @morefice so we would not have to create new ones.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-19T16:56:02.902Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:15.537Z","closed_at":"2020-08-12T21:27:53.373Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","backend","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline insights","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223240","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223240","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223240/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223240/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#223240","relative":"#223240","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#223240"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":49359385,"iid":223212,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove trufflehog dependency in the secrets analyzer","description":"## Summary\nThe secrets analyzer uses both Trufflehog and Gitleaks.

been removed completely","description":"## Summary\n\nThe [SAV feature flag has been completely removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33488). This means now we can start removing the security dashboard components and vuex files.\n\n## More information\n\nPreviously, we had an old security dashboard and a new security dashboard. If the SAV feature flag was enabled, the new security dashboard would be shown; otherwise, the old security dashboard would be shown. Now that the feature flag has been removed, only the new security dashboard is used, and the old security dashboard is now dead code that needs to be removed.\n\nAdditionally, many Vuex modules are loaded and unused in [first_class_init](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ac7226824f2d6ce51d675ceccbdebff0de8c4f2d/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/first_class_init.js#L64), so this ticket should house the work to evaluate which modules, if any, should still be loaded.\n\nFinally, there are some non-Vuex files referencing Vuex files (i.e. `ee/security_dashboard/store/constants` and potentially some `utils.js`/`constants.js` files in `ee/security_dashboard/store/modules/*/utils.js`/`ee/security_dashboard/store/modules/*/constants.js`\n\n![image](/uploads/20d0a94317b82ca64188436c6fd2c33c/image.png)\n\nso these files should potentially be moved out of the `/store` directory\n\nIt's highly recommended to manually assign the MR to @svedova because he implemented most of the new security dashboard and would have a good idea of which files are still used or not.\n\n## Improvements\n\n- Removes code that's no longer used.\n\n## Risks\n\nSome of the vuex files are still used by the new security dashboards. We need to make sure that whatever we remove it's not used. The security tab on a pipeline job also uses some of the components, so please double-check there as well:\n\n||\n|-|\n|![ksnip_20200622-231724](/uploads/9f6dc315151fc20975d2c4f79744f410/ksnip_20200622-231724.png)|\n\n## Involved components\n\nMany files that are backed by Vuex under:

Runner - Releaser CLI integration, it was found that the `multi_build_steps` feature was correctly producing the `releaser-cli` script, but not enclosing the `script` contents in an array, which is the required interface for the Runner.\n\nThis problem and the solution has been described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/26307#note_364134670).\n\nSpecifically `:script` should be sending an array, ie: instead of:\n\n```ruby\n{\n  \"name\" =\u003e \"release\",\n  \"script\" =\u003e \"release-cli create --ref \\\"$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --name \\\"Release $CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --tag-name \\\"release-$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --description \\\"Created using the release-cli $EXTRA_DESCRIPTION\\\"\",\n  \"timeout\" =\u003e 3600,\n  \"when\" =\u003e \"on_success\",\n  \"allow_failure\" =\u003e false\n}\n```\n\nIt should be:\n\n```ruby\n{\n  \"name\" =\u003e \"release\",\n  \"script\" =\u003e [\"release-cli create --ref \\\"$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --name \\\"Release $CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --tag-name \\\"release-$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --description \\\"Created using the release-cli $EXTRA_DESCRIPTION\\\"\"],\n  \"timeout\" =\u003e 3600,\n  \"when\" =\u003e \"on_success\",\n  \"allow_failure\" =\u003e false\n}\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nA full end-to-end test can only be done manually. The steps to do this are described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/26307#note_364134670).\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n(What actually happens)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n(What you should see instead)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n(If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-19T07:58:01.446Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T07:07:07.726Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T07:07:07.625Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","GitLab Release CLI","Release::P3","devops::release","type::bug","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"}],"author":{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223162","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223162","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223162/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223162/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#223162","relative":"#223162","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#223162"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":48940394,"iid":223156,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove stale merge request refs","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nEvery merge request created results in up to two new `refs/merge-requests` (`refs/merge-requests/\u003cid\u003e/head` and `refs/merge-request/\u003cid\u003e/merge`) being created, and these appear to never be deleted.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Maybe keep as is and optimize some child components (though maybe we should optimize as well)\n1. Change to a `v-if`. We get the best performance on initial render as its not going anything, but we may see some slow down when the user toggles the tree view.\n1.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nIn the context of pursuing a solution for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33867 we realise that will involve significant overhaul of internal mechanisms that require better and deeper planning. \n\nFor the time being, it has been proposed to simply disable the commenting on these cases, to avoid breaking the experience or loss of data:\n\n@pedroms wrote:\n\n\u003e We would need to disable the comment icon button and display a tooltip explaining why it's disabled to set the right expectations for users. Maybe something like so:\n\u003e \n\u003e ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/uploads/de094d181aa639599dc0c13d9d7e38ed/image.png)\n\u003e \n\u003e This tooltip text could be used for both added and deleted symbolic links. For files that replace or are replaced by symbolic links, we could use this tooltip text: `Commenting on files that replace or are replaced by symbolic links is currently not supported.`\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nAvoid sending users down a flow that will result in error or data loss.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nDisable comments whenever the diff file is a symlink and cannot, at this time, receive a comment.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/12670#note_361521691 \n\nDeeper refactor of the Diffs app is in discussion but not yet able to be picked up.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-18T12:33:19.833Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T07:29:21.269Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T12:51:45.138Z","closed_by":{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","design-weight::2","devops::create","diff","frontend","group::code review","missed-SLO","missed-deliverable","missed:13.2","missed:13.3","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":2338505,"username":"mle","name":"Michael Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338505/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mle"},{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223076","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223076","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223076/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223076/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#223076","relative":"#223076","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#223076"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"},{"id":47923055,"iid":223074,"project_id":278964,"title":"Unauthorized read for conan repository","description":"**[HackerOne report #901473](https://hackerone.com/reports/901473)** by `fushbey` on 2020-06-18, assigned to @jeremymatos:\n\n### Summary  \nHi, I want to report an unauthorized read related to conan packages, I was not quite familiar with Conan so I had doubts but after several trying, I am confident the bug is there, please confirm to me if I am right.  \nThe bug is, a user that is Guest in a private group, can list Conan packages available in the registry despite not having enough access level, indeed the web restricts access:  \n- When accessing the Web page for the group \u003e Packages \u0026 Registries . Surprisingly this menu item is shown, however on clicking on it the page shows an error message: `Something went wrong while fetching the packages list. `, Inspecting the network calls we see indeed we got a 403 response. to `/api/v4/groups/6/packages?page=1\u0026per_page=20\u0026sort=desc\u0026order_by=created_at\u0026package_name=`.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nNew drop down values should be (user based):\n\n* `All users`\n* `Percent of users`\n* `User IDs`\n* `User Lists`\n\nThe docs should give an explanation of each strategy and its limitation\n\nNot in scope of this issue:\n\nUx refactor of the drop down\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nOur current strategy drop down looks like this:\n![image](/uploads/2afd604743924a4f5abbb61eea3ddccf/image.png)\n\nAll users and percent rollout (logged in users) are confusing for users.\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe Container Registry contains a multitude of image tags. For many users, there are a lot of stale tags inside the registry that have no value.  We have created the *Cleanup policy for tags* feature to help remove the stale data to control storage costs related to the container registry.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\nReview the Cleanup policy UI and propose any possible design changes, including field names, text includes, etc to help refine the experience and better enable users.\n\nAnother important aspect of this work is to better align the form itself with [Gitlab's Pajamas Guidelines around Forms](https://design.gitlab.com/components/forms).\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate an updated design for the Cleanup Policies based on feedback.\n\n| Current Iteration of the Design |\n|---|\n|![Settings_Page_small_regex](/uploads/bd772e32af9a66de63c5ae1ed1396961/Settings_Page_small_regex.png)|\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Future iterations\n* Near the \"cleanup runs every x days\" field, include a way for the user to select the start date (i.e. do it tomorrow, then every 7 days)\n* Add the ability to run the cleanup policy manually (right now)\n* Add a preview ability to get a list of image tags that would be removed if the policy was set to run as is\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe design changes should be purely superficial. The core functionality remains the same, but the documentation may need to be updated if field names change.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nTracking the end to end test in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/1103\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

This prevents us from internally accessing our files using `src.`\n\nThis creates module conflicts in the unit tests. It also prevents the use of relative imports (`from . import X`, `from .. import Y`)\n\nFor example, if there is a class that uses the `report` submodule:\n\n```\n# src/custom_hooks.py\n\nimport report\n\nclass CustomHooks:\n    ...\n```\n\nand the `report` submodule is tested in `test/unit/report/`, then the test will try to load the `report` module from the tests and fail when it can't find whatever `CustomHooks` is accessing from `src/report`.\n\nThis can be see in practice here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/merge_requests/187#note_361639891\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n1. Move all of the Python except `zap-scan-launcher.py` into a new `src/dast` directory (and module).\n2. Pass the original ZAP main scripts into the scan wrapper classes in `zap-scan-launcher.py` (instead of when the scan wrappers are initialized)\n3. Internally and in tests, access modules through the `dast` module (or relative imports where appropriate)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-17T01:45:08.276Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T21:48:03.793Z","closed_at":"2020-06-18T21:48:03.756Z","closed_by":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"labels":["Category:DAST","backend","backend-weight::2","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"}],"author":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222801","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222801","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222801/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/222801/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#222801","relative":"#222801","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#222801"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":45692139,"iid":222793,"project_id":278964,"title":"UpdateRepositoryStorageService should clean up after itself upon encountering a failure","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs a GitLab admin, I want to have the subject of a `ReplicateRepository` GRPC method invocation failure cleaned up, so that I can re-attempt without having to manually delete the failed replica repository directory from its gitaly storage shard file system by hand.\n\nAs I have [learned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2691) Gitaly is not the appropriate place for such an implementation, but rather the `UpdateRepositoryStorageService` should be responsible for cleaning up after a failure detected from the invocation of the `ReplicateRepository` GRPC method, here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/projects/update_repository_storage_service.rb#L84\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThe problem solved here is that when a failure occurs, the failed replica repository is left behind on the destination storage shard file system, and no further attempts may be made, since the repository directory will already exist on the file system of the destination gitaly shard.  This causes a situation in which, at best, gitaly will attempt to set up a second remote configuration and fetch from it into the already existing repository, and at worst, an admin user may give up on the replication or assume it has been successful, and the failed replica repository will continue to exist dormant and unusable on the destination gitaly shard file system indefinitely.\n\n### Intended users\n\nA user with the Sidney persona will use this feature.\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to perform a repository replication (move/migration) to another shard without fear that the replica repository will be left in a broken or inconsistent state.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDetect all failures from the invocation of the `Repository#replicate` method, and delete all artifacts created in association with the Service-level procedure on the destination gitaly shard file system.\n\nThis clean-up action presents zero risk of customer data loss, since the original repository is never modified (only read) during the replication procedure.\n\n### Further details\n\nHere is [an example failure from which clean-up was required](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/2246#note_362413613).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nPermissions required are those that are currently required, an administrator-level access API token.\n\n### Documentation\n\nHere is the [current documentation of manual clean-up procedures](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/gitaly/storage-rebalancing.md#finally-failed-replica-repository-deletion).\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?
