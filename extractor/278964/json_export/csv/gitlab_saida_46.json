[x] Variable set to run a specific test in the runner. This is a CI Pipeline variable that when set will do a `pytest -k EXPRESSION`. This way we don't have to wait for every test to run when iterating. The variable should be defined such that it shows up in the Run Pipeline window.

@nmalcolm:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\nVideo Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSUaEPTf-rY\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nAny user who is either author or assignee of a merge request can approve that merge request's `external status checks`. This includes users with `Guest` access that creates MR's either through email or through a fork of the project. It also includes users with `Guest` or `Reporter` access getting assigned to an MR, which is not uncommon in public projects.\n\nThere exists a tiny overlap with my report [1375376](https://hackerone.com/reports/1375376) which is yet not triaged. I describe this overlap in the end of this summary. The reports look similar, but the vulnerabilities are not related. A fix in 1375376 would not fix this report, only the overlap.\n\nThe `external status check` documentation does not offer too much information about how the feature is supposed to function. But the developer discussions and the unit tests suggests that approving an `external status check` should be restricted for users with at least `Developer` access in the project. Here is the issue tracking the development https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267519\n\nIn this [thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59137#note_567776066) the possibility of users abusing the fact that a status check is not tied to any special token. Rather they use regular PAT's, these discussion mentions\n\n\u003e find_merge_request_with_access will at least mean that only those with developer+ access to the project in question would be able to exploit the feature in this way.\n\nThe [unit tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/spec/requests/api/status_checks_spec.rb#L29) for this feature checks this assumption with these lines\n\n```  \ndescribe 'permissions' do  \n    before do  \n      stub_licensed_features(external_status_checks: true)  \n    end\n\n    it { expect { subject }.to be_allowed_for(:maintainer).of(project) }  \n    it { expect { subject }.to be_allowed_for(:developer).of(project) }  \n    it { expect { subject }.to be_denied_for(:reporter).of(project) }  \n  end  \n```\n\nValidating if the user making the request is developer+.\n\nSo to enforce this they have put an authentication block checking if the user have permission to respond to `external status checks` using the function called `find_merge_request_with_access` in this way  \n```  \nmerge_request = find_merge_request_with_access(params[:merge_request_iid], :approve_merge_request)  \n```  \nChecking the permission `:approve_merge_request` which is enabled for developers. But as it turns out, this permission is also enabled for users with the permission `:update_merge_request`. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/policies/merge_request_policy.rb there is this rule\n\n```  \n rule { can?(:update_merge_request) }.policy do  \n    enable :approve_merge_request  \n  end  \n```  \nThat enables the permission for anyone that are allowed to update the MR. And in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/policies/issuable_policy.rb there exists this rule\n\n```  \nrule { can?(:guest_access) \u0026 assignee_or_author }.policy do  \n    enable :read_issue  \n    enable :update_issue  \n    enable :reopen_issue  \n    enable :read_merge_request  \n    enable :update_merge_request  \n    enable :reopen_merge_request  \n  end  \n```  \nenabling `:update_merge_request` for anyone that have `:guest_access` and is either assignee or author.\n\nThis is probably the root of the problem. And as far as I could make out this is not the intended behavior. A user with `Guest` access can create an MR by forking and directly send approval for all `external status checks` to lure the developers that the MR have been checked. It leads to at least two problems:\n\n* A user with no membership can create a MR in a public project and then \"approve\" the `external status check's without any membership  \n* A user who is demoted to `Reporter` in a private project can still \"approve\" `external status check's in MR's where the user is either author or assignee\n\nand at the moment thanks to the vulnerability that I have reported in [1375376](https://hackerone.com/reports/1375376) at present it is also possible to:  \n* A user who is demoted to `Guest` in a private project can still \"approve\" `external status check's in MR's where the user is either author or assignee while not being able to actually view the MR\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nExternal status checks is an `Ultimate` feature, so make sure the project is created in such an environment\n\n1. Create two users `owner01` and `guest01`  \n2. Log in as `owner01` and create a public project `project01` by visiting https://gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project and take a note of the project ID  \n3. Go to the project settings page and expand the tab `merge requests` and scroll down to `external status checks`, settings page https://gitlab.com/owner01/project01/edit  \n4. Create a status check with any name and endpoint, and leave the   \n5. Log out and log in as `guest01`  \n6. Go to the project page https://gitlab.com/owner01/project01 and create a fork with the `fork` button, call it `fork01`.  \n7. When the fork is created, create a new branch in the fork https://gitlab.com/guest01/fork01/-/branches/new called `new_branch`  \n8. When the fork is created directly click on the option \"create a merge request\", in the \"New merge request\" page click `Change branches` and select the target branch as any branch on the original `project01`  \n9. Click \"Create\" and a new MR should be created in `project01` (this is a guest contribution and a normal open-source flow, but note that the `guest01` user is NOT a member of `project01`)  \n10. Go to https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens and create an access token for the API for `guest01`  \n11. Open a terminal and make this request to get the ID of the status check (user `project01` ID and MR IID which is probably 1 and `guest01` token), take a note of the returned ID of the status check  \n```  \ncurl \"https://gitlab.joaxcar.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cPROJECT_ID\u003e/merge_requests/\u003cMR_IID\u003e/status_checks\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e\"  \n```  \n12. Send this request to check for the SHA, the request will fail with a message telling you which SHA to use, in this request we use a dummy SHA=a (make sure to also replace CHECK_ID to the found ID from step 12)  \n```  \ncurl --request POST \\  \n  --url 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cPROJECT_ID\u003e/merge_requests/\u003cMR_IID\u003e/status_check_responses?sha=a\u0026external_status_check_id=\u003cCHECK_ID\u003e' \\  \n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e'  \n```  \n13. Now use the returned SHA in this request to finally \"approve\" the status check for the MR  \n```  \ncurl --request POST \\  \n  --url 'https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cPROJECT_ID\u003e/merge_requests/\u003cMR_IID\u003e/status_check_responses?sha=\u003cSHA\u003e\u0026external_status_check_id=\u003cCHECK_ID\u003e' \\  \n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e'  \n```  \n14. Go to the MR page and verify that the status check is now green and checked, https://gitlab.com/owner01/project01/-/merge_requests/1\n\n#####  Impact\n\nA `Guest` user can send acknowledge messages to \"approve\" `external status checks` on MR's where the user is either author or assignee. This makes it possible for a malicious user to \"spoof\" acceptance of MR's in projects where the user should not be able to do this. In public projects this mean that any guest contribution from non-members can have its `external status checks` checked by the author itself even if not a member of the project.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsers with access level below `Developer` can accept `external status checks` if they are either author or assignee of the MR\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnly `Developer`+ users that are members of the project should be able to user their PAT to \"approve\" the `external status check`\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nA `Guest` (or `Reporter`) user can send acknowledge messages to \"approve\" `external status checks` on MR's where the user is either author or assignee. This makes it possible for a malicious user to \"spoof\" acceptance of MR's in projects where the user should not be able to do this. In public projects this mean that any guest contribution from non-members can have its `external status checks` checked by the author itself even if not a member of the project.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-21T11:04:21.988Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T13:27:01.892Z","closed_at":"2022-07-01T10:19:30.651Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["auto updated","devops::create","feature flag","group::code review","missed:15.1","section::dev","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"}],"author":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343528","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":6},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343528","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343528/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343528/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343528","relative":"#343528","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343528"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5331,"epic":{"id":195597,"iid":5331,"title":"Merge requests that require my attention","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5331","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95834990,"iid":343510,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow MR author to automatically run review app pipeline by using a label","description":"As an MR author, they should be able to set the MR to always run the review app pipeline with its related jobs.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70235) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_update_unlocked_job_artifacts`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_update_unlocked_job_artifacts` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70235) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_update_unlocked_job_artifacts --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_update_unlocked_job_artifacts --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_update_unlocked_job_artifacts`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_update_unlocked_job_artifacts false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-20T18:27:23.576Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T00:14:27.327Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T02:19:11.928Z","closed_by":{"id":6354882,"username":"alberts-gitlab","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6354882/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab"},"labels":["auto updated","feature flag","missed:14.10","missed:14.5","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","missed:14.9","missed:15.0","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","missed:15.3","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},{"id":3916059,"username":"mattkasa","name":"Matt Kasa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3916059/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mattkasa"},{"id":6354882,"username":"alberts-gitlab","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6354882/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":3916059,"username":"mattkasa","name":"Matt Kasa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3916059/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mattkasa"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343465","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":45,"completed_count":17},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"17 of 45 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343465","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343465/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343465/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343465","relative":"#343465","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343465"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95813708,"iid":343458,"project_id":278964,"title":"RepositoryImportWorker issues long database transactions","description":"On GitLab.com, `RepositoryImportWorker` has been identified to issue long database transactions.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Vulnerable package\n1. Introduced package\n1. shortest path\n1. longest path\n\nConsider the outcome of the data additions for dependencies research [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure/tech-docs/data-model-for-dependencies-information/) - and let me know how many issues we need in order to add all four of those data points, and what pre-requisites and blockers you know of that will prevent us from starting to add those 4 data points.\n\nAdditionally do you see other information that is needed that we don't yet have to accomplish [this issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335504/designs/post-mvc-1.png)\n\n## Outcome\n\nIn the MVC, we deliver text-only dependency path information in the vulnerability page by leveraging:\n- The vulnerability [`details`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/v14.1.0/dist/dependency-scanning-report-format.json#L692) field of the Dependency Scanning report.\n- The dependency graph Gemnasium builds in memory. This graph is already available for NuGet, Sbt, and Yarn projects, and is already used to generate the `dependency_path` field of the Dependency Scanning report. (This is one the shortest dependency paths to the vulnerable dependency).\n\nIssues for the MVC:\n\n1. **Show the vulnerable package.** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348530\n   - Update Gemnasium to add the name and version of the affected as a single vulnerability `details` field (string). Technically, this information is already available in the `location` field, and repeating it in the `details` field will make it visible in the Vulnerability Page without changing the backend or the frontend.\n   - Available for all package managers supported by Gemnasium (gemnasium, gemnasium-maven, or gemansium-python).\n   - gemnasium, gemnasium-maven, and gemansium-python are all updated.\n1. **Show one introduced package.** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348531\n   - Update Gemnasium to infer one introduced package from the shortest dependency path, and to add it as a single vulnerability `details` field (string).\n   - There's nothing to show when the vulnerable package is the introduced package.\n   - Available for Sbt, NuGet, and Yarn.\n   - gemnasium and gemnasium-maven are updated.\n1. **Show one shortest path.** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348532\n   - Update Gemnasium to add the shortest path to the vulnerability `details` field of the report. This repeats the existing `dependency_path` field. The value of the `details` can either be a single string or an array of strings.\n   - There's nothing to show when the vulnerable package is the introduced package, or its direct dependency.\n   - Available for Sbt, NuGet, and Yarn.\n   - gemnasium and gemnasium-maven are updated.\n\nPossible [post-MVC](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3858) issues:\n\n* **[Extend dependency graph support](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7288)** to other package managers, beyond Sbt, NuGet, and Yarn. (The vulnerable package, introduced package, short path `details` fields are immediately available for any package manager for which Gemnasium builds an internal dependency graph.)\n* [Introduce a new **dependency graph artifact**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348534), created by Gemnasium and parsed by the Rails backend.\n* **[Present the graph](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348535)** that connects a vulnerable package to the project itself, in the UI. This graph could be interactive, presented with colors, etc.\n* [Show one **longest path**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348536) to the vulnerable package, or some kind of complexity score that gives a sense of how much the project is connected to the vulnerable package.\n* [Show **all introduced packages**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348537) in the Vulnerability Page. Update Gemnasium to infer all the introduced packages from the internal dependency graph, and to add them to the vulnerability `details` field.\n\nSee [thread](#note_773459446).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-20T05:22:05.476Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T20:34:13.114Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T11:18:04.986Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":3913516,"username":"NicoleSchwartz","name":"Nicole Schwartz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3913516/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NicoleSchwartz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":44,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343395","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343395","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343395/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343395/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343395","relative":"#343395","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343395"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3843,"epic":{"id":78549,"iid":3843,"title":"Show paths to dependencies MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3843","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":95744628,"iid":343390,"project_id":278964,"title":"Foldered production environments can not be attached to MRs","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen a user executes [a deployment job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/#deployment-jobs) that is related to a particular merge request, GitLab creates a relationship between Deployment entry and Merge Request entry. For example, there is a `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n\n```yaml\ndeploy:\n  script: echo\n  environment: production\n  only: [main]\n```\n\nWhen an MR has been merged, GitLab parses the commit diffs of Git between the previous deployment and the latest deployment, and if an merge commit is included in the commit history, the Deployment-MergeRequest relationship is established. \nThis information can be fetched via [List of merge requests associated with a deployment API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deployments.html#list-of-merge-requests-associated-with-a-deployment).\n\nHowever, if [environments are foldred](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/22539), the relationship doesn't work, for example:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy-web:\n  script: echo\n  environment: production/web\n\ndeploy-api:\n  script: echo\n  environment: production/api\n``` \n\nThis is because we don't allow the foldered environments to do so:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/deployments/link_merge_requests_service.rb#L16-19\n\n```ruby\n    def execute\n      # Review apps have the environment type set (e.g. to `review`, though the\n      # exact value may differ).

The feature is an `Ultimate` feature, but can be accessed by starting an `Ultimate` trial on GitLab.com. So the attack is possible with a regular account.\n\nWhen an `external status check` is configured, the project will send out information about MRs to a specified endpoint. This endpoint can then be configured to answer to the request to \"pass\" the status check. Description of the feature [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/status_checks.html). The API endpoint for this answer is ([info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/status_checks.html#set-status-of-an-external-status-check))  \n```  \nPOST /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/status_check_responses  \n```  \nwith the passed in parameters `sha` and `external_status_check_id`. It is the later one that contains the IDOR. This parameter tells GitLab which `external status check` the request is targeting. And the answer back from GitLab is JSON containing info about the MR but also info about the status check configuration. By altering the ID sent, a user can obtain info about any status check on the instance (even from Private projects).\n\nLeaked information about a status check could look like the example below and could contain:\n\n* Private project name and ID  \n* Name of status check  \n* Private address to external status check tool  \n* Name and ID of protected branch connected to the status check  \n* Access rules to protected branch, if configured also name of user that is allowed to access\n\n```  \n\"external_status_check\": {  \n    \"id\": 10,  \n    \"name\": \"Name of status check\",  \n    \"project_id\": 33,  \n    \"external_url\": \"https://victim.service.com\",  \n    \"protected_branches\": [  \n      {  \n        \"id\": 24,  \n        \"name\": \"Name of protected branch\",  \n        \"push_access_levels\": [  \n          {  \n            \"access_level\": 40,  \n            \"access_level_description\": \"Name of user with access to protected branch\",  \n            \"user_id\": 2,  \n            \"group_id\": null  \n          },  \n          {  \n            \"access_level\": 30,  \n            \"access_level_description\": \"Developers + Maintainers\",  \n            \"user_id\": null,  \n            \"group_id\": null  \n          }  \n        ],  \n        \"merge_access_levels\": [  \n          {  \n            \"access_level\": 30,  \n            \"access_level_description\": \"Developers + Maintainers\",  \n            \"user_id\": null,  \n            \"group_id\": null  \n          },  \n          {  \n            \"access_level\": 40,  \n            \"access_level_description\": \"Name of user with access\",  \n            \"user_id\": 2,  \n            \"group_id\": null  \n          }  \n        ],  \n        \"allow_force_push\": true,  \n        \"unprotect_access_levels\": [],  \n        \"code_owner_approval_required\": true  \n      }  \n```\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create two users `victim01` and `attacker01`  \n2. Log in as `victim01` and create a new PRIVATE project called `victim_project` at https://gitlab.domain.com/projects/new#blank_project  \n3. Go to go to project settings https://gitlab.domain.com/victim01/victim_project/edit and expand \"Merge request\" under \"General\". Scroll down to \"Status checks\" and click create new.  \n4. Name the status check \"Victim status check\" and enter a API endpoint \"https://victim.hidden.com\"  \n5. Click save  \n6. Log out and log back in as `attacker01`  \n7. Go through step 2 to 5 again but name the project `attacker_project` and the status check anything. Take a note of the ID of the project. We will call it `attackID`  \n8. Now create a new branch in `attacker_project` at https://gitlab.domain.com/attacker01/attacker_project/-/branches/new  \n9. Click \"Create new merge request\" when the branch is created. Name the MR anything and click create  \n10. Go to https://gitlab.domain.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens and create an access token for `attacker01`, we will call it `TOKEN`  \n11. Open a terminal and make this request (the SHA is just \"a\" here, we will get the correct one as a response)  \n```  \ncurl --request POST \\  \n  --url 'https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cATTACKID\u003e/merge_requests/1/status_check_responses?sha=a\u0026external_status_check_id=2' \\  \n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e'  \n```  \n12. This iniitial request will return an error saying `the correct sha is \u003cSHA\u003e`  \n13. Now send with correct SHA  \n```  \ncurl --request POST \\  \n  --url 'https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cATTACKID\u003e/merge_requests/1/status_check_responses?sha=\u003cSHA\u003e\u0026external_status_check_id=2' \\  \n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e'  \n```  \n14. We will get a response with info about the MR and in the end info about the `status check`  \n15. Now send the same request again but change status check id to 1  \n```  \ncurl --request POST \\  \n  --url 'https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cATTACKID\u003e/merge_requests/1/status_check_responses?sha=\u003cSHA\u003e\u0026external_status_check_id=1' \\  \n  --header 'Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e'  \n```  \n16. The same MR info is returned, but in the end there will be info about the private status check from `victim_project`\n\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAn attacker can leak information about any `external status check` on the instance. This data contains sensitive private information.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe parameter `external_status_check_id` is not restricted to the status checks configured in the project.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe parameter should only allow IDs that corresponds to status checks in the target project.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nLeaked information about a status check could look like the example below and could contain:\n\n* Private project name and ID  \n* Name of status check  \n* Private address to external status check tool  \n* Name and ID of protected branch connected to the status check  \n* Access rules to protected branch, if configured also name of user that is allowed to access\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nSee above!\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T23:04:17.227Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T03:07:50.449Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T10:00:53.220Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-639","backend","devops::manage","group::compliance","priority::1","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::awaiting security release"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-12-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343379","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343379","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343379/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343379/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343379","relative":"#343379","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343379"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95720309,"iid":343368,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rebalance issues FF rollout","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nEnable the `:rebalance_issues` feature flag. \n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Create / Source Code\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_source_code`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @acroitor \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nProblematic issue sets (ones that show large numbers of timeouts and `NoSpaceLeft` exceptions) should begin rebalancing, and the incidence of these errors should decline.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThis may consume a large number of resources in the worker, since this can be a long running worker, which may itself timeout.

deprecated fullPath arguments from frontend DAST mutations","description":"The following discussion from !72478 should be addressed:\n\n- [x] @philipcunningham started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72478#note_707157152):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e @djadmin @pgascouvaillancourt just a heads-up that this merge request deprecates `fullPath` from a number of `dast` mutations (`dastProfileRun`, `dastProfileUpdate`, `dastScannerProfileDelete`, `dastScannerProfileUpdate`, `dastSiteProfileDelete`, `dastSiteProfileDelete`) because it isn't required to qualify them.\n\n---\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72478, the `fullPath` argument has been deprecated in several GraphQL mutations that don't actually need it to function. The following mutations are affected:\n\n- `dastProfileRun`\n- `dastProfileUpdate`\n- `dastScannerProfileDelete`\n- `dastScannerProfileUpdate`\n- `dastSiteProfileDelete`\n- `dastSiteProfileUpdate`\n\nLet's cleanup the ~frontend code so that we don't unnecessarily pass `fullPath` to those mutations. Here are the Vue components we should look at:\n\n- [x] `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/dast_profiles/components/dast_saved_scans_list.vue`\n- [x] `ee/app/assets/javascripts/on_demand_scans_form/components/on_demand_scans_form.vue`\n- [x] `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/dast_profiles/components/dast_profiles.vue`\n- [x] `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/dast_profiles/dast_scanner_profiles/components/dast_scanner_profile_form.vue`\n- [x] `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/dast_profiles/dast_site_profiles/components/dast_site_profile_form.vue`\n\n\u003e **Note:** The `Create` mutations still require the `fullPath` argument to be passed. However, in some places in the codebase, the `Create` and `Update` mutations are handled by the same bit of code to reduce duplication. In those cases, we'll want to make sure the argument is removed from the `Update` mutation _only_.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T08:41:36.581Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T08:14:40.949Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T08:14:26.598Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["Category:DAST","deprecation","devops::secure","documentation","frontend","group::dynamic analysis","maintenance::refactor","section::sec","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":4814125,"username":"mehulsharma","name":"Mehul Sharma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4814125/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mehulsharma"}],"author":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4814125,"username":"mehulsharma","name":"Mehul Sharma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4814125/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mehulsharma"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343314","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343314","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343314/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343314/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343314","relative":"#343314","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343314"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95668123,"iid":343313,"project_id":278964,"title":"Web IDE Dark Syntax Highlight Mode Text Color Issues","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\nUsing the WebIDE with any of the dark syntax highlighting schemes has some graphical issues where certain text strings are very hard to read.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1.

Probably those tables can be used to accomplish this same join in the CI database.\n\nI believe the query should actually be\n\n```ruby\nproject: namespace_monthly_usage.namespace.all_projects # include projects from nested namespaces                                                                                         \n```\n\nWhich would return even more results. To display the breakdown of usage for a root namespace we need to pull all projects under it.\n\nI'm wondering whether we could rewrite the `Types::Ci::Minutes::NamespaceMonthlyUsageType#projects` the other way around:\n\n* from namespace list all projects in it (kind of what `NamespaceType#projects` does) as a type `ProjectMonthlyUsageType`.\n* Use `Batchloader::GraphQL` to get the usage data from `Ci::Minutes::ProjectMonthlyUsage` for each `project_id` and `date`.\n* With the [default pagination](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/getting_started.html#pagination) we would query for 100 `project_ids` at the time.\n\nside notes: I'm also noticing that:\n\n* both `Ci::Minutes::ProjectMonthlyUsageType` and `Ci::Minutes::NamespaceMonthlyUsageType` don't authorize the results, which we definitely should.\n* `Ci::Minutes::ProjectMonthlyUsageType#name` may cause N+1. I believe that the rewriting suggested above can eliminate that.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T03:20:24.989Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T15:31:02.594Z","closed_at":"2022-01-28T15:31:02.561Z","closed_by":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Engineering Allocation","FY22::Q4","OKR","Verify::P2","auto updated","backend","ci-decomposition","ci-decomposition::phase6","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343301","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343301","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343301/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343301/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343301","relative":"#343301","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343301"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6379,"epic":{"id":309971,"iid":6379,"title":"Decomposition: Make Ops features compatible with Decomposed CI database","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6379","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95647799,"iid":343298,"project_id":278964,"title":"Check LDAP user status on sign-in with other authentication methods","description":"### Summary\n\nIf LDAP is used as the authentication method, an `ldap_blocked` user will be unblocked on sign-in if the user is valid in LDAP. However, when a non-LDAP authentication method is configured alongside LDAP (such as Azure AD) and the user becomes `ldap_blocked` we do not recheck the LDAP user status on sign-in. \n\n## Scenario\n\nUser becomes `ldap_blocked` by either `LdapSyncWorker` (once daily) or the default 1-hour `sync_time`. This can happen either due to transient communication issues with LDAP, or maybe the user actually was disabled/removed from LDAP for a period of time. \n\nWhen signing in via another method, if the user is `ldap_blocked` we should proactively check with LDAP to see if the user is now active. If yes, unblock the user and allow sign-in.\n\n## Problem This Solves\n\nIn [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18421), if the LDAP server is flaky or cannot be reached, users are immediately blocked, even when another authentication method is configured and status is maintained there. \n\nThis was causing users to be unable to login, and a manual sync initiated by the customer had to take place in order to reset the users back to \"active\".","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T01:38:15.247Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T13:10:40.154Z","closed_at":"2021-11-08T23:18:00.252Z","closed_by":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah

The attack can be triggered either in the CI/CD Editor if the user has write access or on CI/CD Pipeline detail page if the user has read access to the CI/CD.\n\n\n####  Steps to reproduce\n\nOn the CI/CD Editor page  \n1. Create a repository  \n2. Go to `CI/CD` \u003e `Editor`  \n4. Click `Create new CI/CD Pipeline`  \n3. Replace the code with the following  \n```yaml  \n\":[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:[]:\":  \n  script:  \n    - echo \"hi\"  \n```  \nAs  the code changes, the editor will try to validate the new code and the attack is launched.  \nThe time scales exponentially with respect to the  size of the `[]:` pattern (the pattern in the code above makes my CPU spike to 100% for about 10 seconds).\n\nOn the CI/CD Pipeline detail page  \n1.  Follow the previous instruction and submit the changes in the editor  \n2. Go to `CI/CD` \u003e `Pipelines`  \n3. Open the newly created pipeline to launch the attack by clicking on its `ID`. The `Pipeline` tab will hang for multiple seconds.\n\nIt is also possible to reproduce both of these attacks with a single HTTP request.  \nFor example the request from the CI/CD Pipeline detail page (fields between `\u003c \u003e` must be changed)\n\n```  \nPOST /api/graphql HTTP/1.1  \nHost: \u003cHOST\u003e  \nContent-Type: application/json  \nX-CSRF-Token: \u003cCSRF-TOKEN\u003e  \nOrigin: http://\u003cHOST\u003e  \nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin  \nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors  \nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty  \nCookie:  \u003cCOOKIES\u003e  \nConnection: close\n\n{\"query\":\"fragment LinkedPipelineData on Pipeline {\\n  __typename\\n  id\\n  iid\\n  path\\n  status: detailedStatus {\\n    __typename\\n    group\\n    label\\n    icon\\n  }\\n  sourceJob {\\n    __typename\\n    name\\n  }\\n  project {\\n    __typename\\n    name\\n    fullPath\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nquery getPipelineDetails($projectPath: ID!, $iid: ID!) {\\n  project(fullPath: $projectPath) {\\n    __typename\\n    pipeline(iid: $iid) {\\n      __typename\\n      id\\n      iid\\n      complete\\n      usesNeeds\\n      userPermissions {\\n        updatePipeline\\n      }\\n      downstream {\\n        __typename\\n        nodes {\\n          ...LinkedPipelineData\\n        }\\n      }\\n      upstream {\\n        ...LinkedPipelineData\\n      }\\n      stages {\\n        __typename\\n        nodes {\\n          __typename\\n          name\\n          status: detailedStatus {\\n            __typename\\n            action {\\n              __typename\\n              icon\\n              path\\n              title\\n            }\\n          }\\n          groups {\\n            __typename\\n            nodes {\\n              __typename\\n              status: detailedStatus {\\n                __typename\\n                label\\n                group\\n                icon\\n              }\\n              name\\n              size\\n              jobs {\\n                __typename\\n                nodes {\\n                  __typename\\n                  name\\n                  scheduledAt\\n                  needs {\\n                    __typename\\n                    nodes {\\n                      __typename\\n                      name\\n                    }\\n                  }\\n                  status: detailedStatus {\\n                    __typename\\n                    icon\\n                    tooltip\\n                    hasDetails\\n                    detailsPath\\n                    group\\n                    action {\\n                      __typename\\n                      buttonTitle\\n                      icon\\n                      path\\n                      title\\n                    }\\n                  }\\n                }\\n              }\\n            }\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\",\"variables\":{\"projectPath\":\"\u003cusername\u003e/\u003crepo_name\u003e\",\"iid\":1}}  \n```\n\n####  Impact\n\nThe CPU of the server will spike to 100% for as long as the attacker wants (based on the job name size). The attack can be repeated an unlimited number of times and does not require any user interaction. The client wont be able to validate the pipeline in the web editor nor access the Pipeline tab on the Pipeline detail page.\n\nAny user with read access (or everyone if the repository and CI/CD is set to public) will inadvertently launch an attack just by visiting the Pipeline detail page.\n\n\n####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe regex used to separate the name of the job from it's group runs in exponential time in the worst case. The relevant code is located in the file `app/models/commit_status.rb`\n\n```ruby  \n  def group_name  \n    name.to_s.sub(%r{([\\b\\s:]+((\\[.*\\])|(\\d+[\\s:\\/\\\\]+\\d+)))+\\s*\\z}, '').strip  \n  end  \n```  \nPlease see [https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html) for more information about bad regex's and some solutions.\n\n\n####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nThe above code should run in linear time (quadratic time will lead to the same result but with input size of a few hundred to a few thousand characters).\n\n\n####  Results of GitLab environment info  \nGitLab installed from docker\n\n```  \nsudo docker exec -it gitlab gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info\n\nSystem information  \nSystem:  \nProxy:          no  \nCurrent User:   git  \nUsing RVM:      no  \nRuby Version:   2.7.4p191  \nGem Version:    3.1.4  \nBundler Version:2.1.4  \nRake Version:   13.0.6  \nRedis Version:  6.0.14  \nGit Version:    2.33.0.  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.9  \nGo Version:     unknown\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:        14.3.0-ee  \nRevision:       dec73e99fdd  \nDirectory:      /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails  \nDB Adapter:     PostgreSQL  \nDB Version:     12.7  \nURL:            http://gitlab.local  \nHTTP Clone URL: http://gitlab.local/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:  git@gitlab.local:some-group/some-project.git  \nElasticsearch:  no  \nGeo:            no  \nUsing LDAP:     no  \nUsing Omniauth: yes  \nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:        13.21.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default:      /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:              /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell  \nGit:            /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git  \n```\n\n\n####  Examples\n\nThe attached file contains an exported repository with the results from the steps described above.\n\n####  Impact\n\nThe CPU of the server will spike to 100% for as long as the attacker wants (based on the job name size).

[ci_always_track_shared_runners_usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254231) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline execution\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline_execution`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @fabiopitino \n- PM: @jheimbuck_gl \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n- We should see an [increase of `Ci::Minutes::UpdateProjectAndNamespaceUsageWorker` schedules](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/sidekiq-worker-detail/sidekiq-worker-detail?orgId=1\u0026var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-worker=Ci::Minutes::UpdateProjectAndNamespaceUsageWorker) since we now schedule the worker even if CI minutes consumption is `0` but the duration is non-zero.\n- `Ci::Minutes::UpdateProjectAndNamespaceUsageWorker` is scheduled with a new `{ duration: x }` parameter to track wall clock duration separately from CI minutes consumption\n- `ci_namespace_usages.shared_runners_duration` and `ci_project_usages.shared_runners_duration` is incremented regardless of `amount_used` (CI minutes consumption)\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n\u003c!-- Should the feature flag be turned off? Any MRs that need to be rolled back? Communication that needs to happen? What are some things you can think of that could go wrong - data loss or broken pages? --\u003e\n\n- Disable the feature flag if something is wrong with the CI minutes consumption\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- Grafana [dashboard about the worker](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/sidekiq-worker-detail/sidekiq-worker-detail?orgId=1\u0026var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-worker=Ci::Minutes::UpdateProjectAndNamespaceUsageWorker)\n- Kibana logs [about the worker](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/4c32ed90465990f31c1fc3cf8565658f)\n- Check that namespace and project level data is updated correctly with `shared_runners_duration`\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes.

At the same time, some users struggle with setting up an initial cluster with GitLab. For a long time, GitLab provided a GUI based solution to support our users. The solution had several shortcomings. Once users wanted to customize their clusters they did not have any options to do so within GitLab and the GUI based approach did not allow the solution to grow together with our users. We are today releasing an example project and related documentation on setting up and connecting a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. In this iteration, the example project creates an [AWS EKS cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/connect/new_eks_cluster.html). We plan to add similar supporting material for [GKE clusters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/connect/new_gke_cluster.html) too.\n\n## Proposal \n\nCreate a template project to set up an EKS cluster using Terraform similar to the [GKE cluster documented here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/#create-a-new-cluster-through-iac).\n\n### Features\n\n- set up EKS cluster\n- configure by CI variables as with GKE\n- install the Agent\n\n## Definition of done\n\n- [x] Update docs to include tutorial similar to the [GKE example](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/connect/new_gke_cluster.html) \n- [ ] Create [a project template](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/project-templates/#contributing-a-new-project-template) as part of the tutorial","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T11:13:03.875Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T07:51:46.857Z","closed_at":"2022-02-21T04:14:57.088Z","closed_by":{"id":3167938,"username":"tigerwnz","name":"Tiger Watson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2c062f746fe8a57d693ee307942aa5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tigerwnz"},"labels":["Deliverable","GitLab Free","auto updated","backend","devops::configure","documentation","group::configure","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":3167938,"username":"tigerwnz","name":"Tiger Watson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2c062f746fe8a57d693ee307942aa5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tigerwnz"}],"author":{"id":4545061,"username":"nagyv-gitlab","name":"Viktor Nagy (GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb255c1e9c228b9356af165939b3ac9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nagyv-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3167938,"username":"tigerwnz","name":"Tiger Watson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2c062f746fe8a57d693ee307942aa5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tigerwnz"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343229","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":1},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343229","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343229/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343229/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343229","relative":"#343229","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343229"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2996,"epic":{"id":37199,"iid":2996,"title":"Cloud provider support (AWS, Google, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2996","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95593133,"iid":343226,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix  staging Snowplow collection pipeline","description":"## Background\n\nThis is follow up issue to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340270.

(read-only Monaco)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67864)\n- [Monaco](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67805)\n- [HighlightJS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68652)\n\nThis spike is about evaluating each one of the solutions and figuring out which one of the three is the most viable.\n\n### Things to keep in mind\n\nHere are some things we need to keep in mind when making the decision.\n\n- Performance impact\n- Language support\n- UX impact\n- Feature support (Sourcegraph, Code intelligence, [.gitattributes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/git_attributes.html#syntax-highlighting) etc.)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T08:52:10.112Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T19:32:48.713Z","closed_at":"2022-01-19T19:32:48.704Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André

Warning Banner about behavior change in calculation in 15.0","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWe're changing how the date filter works. Instead of filtering by creation time, we will filter by end event time. Users who were monitoring the VSA metrics (and relied on it) will see completely different figures once this change is rolled out.\n\nWe should warn the users about this in advance\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nAdd a notification banner with the following text: \n\n`Value Stream Analytics are currently calculated by the start time. There is an [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6046) that will change the Value Stream Analytics calculation to end time.`\n\n![image](/uploads/e1ad3b3820c652b3b868e27327fded44/image.png)\n\nThis banner should be added to both group level VSA.\n\n(project level VSA requires license checks - this is out of scope of this issue)\n\nAlso add a section to the docs that explains the new calculation change in %\"15.0\" \n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T07:39:42.104Z","updated_at":"2022-02-20T15:55:12.946Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T18:11:14.716Z","closed_by":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","GitLab Free","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","devops::manage","direction","documentation","frontend","group::optimize","priority::2","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343209","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343209","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343209/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343209/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343209","relative":"#343209","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343209"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95569626,"iid":343205,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Ensure child pipeline jobs are created in scheduled child pipelines\"","description":"The following discussion from !72477 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @alberts-gitlab started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72477#note_705845877): \n\n    \u003e In a follow up, we might be able to simplify this to something like the following, as the job should be always be created as long as the child pipeline is created by `start-review-app-pipeline`.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```yml\n    \u003e .review:rules:review-build-cng:\n    \u003e   rules:\n    \u003e     -

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nWe've improved the copy in the Re-deploy and Rollback Environment modals to deliver a more consistent experience so that users can better understand what actions to take when fixing a problem with a deployment.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nClarify the wording to make users understand that redeploying an environment is different from rolling it back.\n\n### Details\n\nOn the Environments page, the copy reads:\n\n\u003e Re-deploy environment production?\n\u003e \n\u003e This action will relaunch the job for commit 21d15a1e, putting the environment in a previous version. Are you sure you want to continue?\n\nThe use of \"previous version\" is confusing. The user may need to redeploy the most recent commit in a pipeline and the language makes it sound like it will be rolled back instead.\n\n![Screencast_2022-03-22_10_06_43](/uploads/31aea2d9066b95613ab2fb1ed477952b/Screencast_2022-03-22_10_06_43.webm)\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nIn the environments page, and detail page, when rollback and re-deploy options are available, the modal copy should be updated to reflect the following:\n\n#### Re-deploy modal\n\n* Modal title: Re-deploy environment \u003cenvironment_name\u003e?\n* Modal message: This action will [retry the latest deployment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#retry-or-roll-back-a-deployment) with the commit \u003ccommit_ID\u003e for this environment. Are you sure you want to continue?\n* Actions:\n    * Cancel\n    * Re-deploy environment\n\n#### Rollback modal\n\n* Modal title: Rollback environment \u003cenvironment_name\u003e?\n* Modal message: This action will [roll back this environment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#retry-or-roll-back-a-deployment) next to a previously successful deployment for commit \u003ccommit_ID\u003e. Are you sure you want to continue?\n* Actions:\n    * Cancel\n    * Rollback environment\n\nInclude link to the documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#retry-or-roll-back-a-deployment\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n\n\n### Feature Usage Metrics\n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature?

We used to use `vue-toasted`, which allowed HTML content to be rendered by default. In %\"14.1\" we have [switched](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/628) to BootstrapVue's built-in toast plugin which only renders plain text.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to a project's `Settings \u003e CI/CD` page.\n1. Trigger a new Auto DevOps pipeline **(need more details here)**.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe pipelines page link is escaped.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe toast should contain a clickable link to the pipelines page.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/3b9171d79c5e69f8202070adb54787f9/image.png) \n\n### Possible fixes\n\n#### Remove the link\n\nBased on @jeldergl's [accessibility concerns](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2438#note_706474233), another solution might be to remove the link altogether. We would keep the text as is, but users would have to access the pipelines page via the left sidebar.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-10-26_at_9.55.07_AM](/uploads/aa903221a0dfa33b2b62f239bad93b7a/Screen_Shot_2021-10-26_at_9.55.07_AM.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003eOther possibles fixes that we chose not to implement\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n#### Render `VNode`s\n\nBootstrapVue's toasts can display custom content if they are passed an array of `VNode`s instead of a plain text message. More details in the docs: https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/toast#advanced-usage.\n\nWe could leverage that approach to render the Auto DevOps pipeline message as a set of `VNode`s so that the link renders as expected.\n\n#### Render the link as a toast action\n\nThis approach involves changing the toasts looks a bit. Instead of embedding the link inside the message, we could leverage the `action` option to render the link separately, as the toast's action. This involves that we add support for rendering action links in `GlToast` (the option currently only supports a callback).

Audit: Synthesize results of scan configuration audit","description":"## Summary\nAs part of [Secure: Scan Configuration Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6614), we are performing an audit of the states and UI patterns for every security scanner with a configuration interface. The goal of the audit is to identify patterns and inconsistencies and create recommendations focused on improving consistency and learnability between the scanners. **This issue is for tracking and documenting findings after synthesizing results from the audit.** \n\nThe parent issue that documents all scanners being audited is linked below: \u003cbr\u003e\n👉 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340334\n\n## Plan\n* [x] Evaluate and compare workflow documents for each scanner's configuration process\n* [x] Evaluate and compare screenshots for each scanner's configuration process\n* [x] Generate and document findings/recommendations in an easy to digest way\n\n\n## Findings\n\n### 📍 **Learnability:** Enabling and configuring a security tool in GitLab can be challenging\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eThe workflows for enabling security scanners in GitLab are not consistent (ultimate users)\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n**3 of 8 scanners can be enabled via auto-generated MR.**\n- 1 of those 3 (SAST) provides configuration options within the UI prior to generating the MR. \n\n**5 of 8 scanners must be enabled by editing the CI file**\n- 2 of those 5 (DAST \u0026 API Fuzzing) provide configuration options within the UI and assist users by generated a code snippet based on their chosen configuration. The code snippet must be manually added to the CI file to enable scanning\n\nConsidering the previous 2 points, it's possible for a user to configure 4 security scanners and **encounter a different experience EVERY TIME**. The image below illustrates a simplified chart of the 4 possible workflows:\n\n![secure-scannerConfig-workflows](/uploads/b7990a87f86c208f7906806bfbe54a8d/secure-scannerConfig-workflows.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eThe way that security testing works in GitLab isn't explained in the UI, so users have to make assumptions (expectation setting)\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn general, the instructions and descriptions within the security configuration area could be improved to provide more useful or relevant information. The UI copy mostly focuses on the \"what\", but doesn't really mention the \"how\" or the \"why\". Incorporating this information into the UI could help manage users' expectations about how security works at GitLab. \n  \n1. The fact that security scans run as pipeline jobs is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the UI. (not knowing about this association could lead confusion when configuring or running a scan)\n2. It's not mentioned in the UI that enabling a security scan requires adding it to the project's CI/CD pipeline\n3. The descriptions of the various scan types are all *very* similar. Users who are unfamiliar with application security testing tools may have a difficult time trying to decipher the difference between them.\n4. The main security configuration page, for example, makes a lot of assumptions about a user's understanding of security scanning and GitLab as a whole. \n![config-notes](/uploads/317cff47a312477850e0d594295b9d03/config-notes.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eWhen enabling a scanner, many of the UI configuration options provide little explanation or guidance\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. SAST does a decent job explaining config options but could use a little refinement. Some items seem overly technical and others are a little vague\n2. DAST has a few issues:\n    1. No explanation of what \"profiles\" are when none exist\n    2. When profiles exist, the guidance given to users is a little confusing\n    3. When creating a site or scanner profile, many explanations are relatively vague or missing altogether. \n3. API Fuzzing has a couple of fields that have little-to-no explanation\n4. On-demand DAST has the same issues as CI/CD DAST and is lacking descriptions for most on-demand specific configuration options.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n___\n### 📍 **Consistency:** The workflow to enable a security scanner in GitLab differs from tool to tool\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eOnly 3 scanners provide configuration options within the UI and they're all a little different \u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. The SAST \u0026 API Fuzzing configuration forms are very similar in layout and feel but require a different workflow to actually enable the scanner\n1. DAST and API Fuzzing follow the same workflow to be enabled but have very different configuration forms. \n1. The DAST and SAST configuration processes are very different from one another.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eField validation and other error handling is minimal and inconsistent\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- The 3 scanners with UI configuration options (SAST, DAST, API Fuzzing) all handle field errors differently. Most fields have no validation.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eDAST offers additional functionality beyond basic CI/CD configuration. It is the only scanner that does this currently\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. Create and manage site and scanner profiles\n2. On-demand scans\n3. Saved scans\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eThe dynamic analysis tools share a couple key concepts\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. Both API fuzzing and DAST have the concept of `scan profiles`\n    1. Scan profiles contain configuration details that define how a scanner should test its target. Profiles do not contain information about the scan target itself. \n    2. The content of a scan profile is dependent on the type of scanner it is for. \n    3. Currently only DAST allows for user-defined scan profiles. API fuzzing offers pre-defined profiles right now but is slated to expand to user-defined profiles in the future \n2. DAST site profiles that are defined as a `Rest API` don't allow for authentication; API fuzzing does. Is there a reason why one allows for authentication and the other does not?\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n___\n### 📍 JTBD evaluation: Of the 3 configuration-related JTBD, none are addressed by every security tool\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eJTBD 1 (3/6): When I am configuring a CI/CD security scan, I want to specify which assets need to be scanned and under which circumstances, So that I can ensure my assets are secure prior to or at their release.\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. 3 / 6 scanners evaluated satisfy this job\n   1.

The end of the configuration process (merging code to enable the feature) doesn't do a great job assuring users that the scanner is properly enabled. The change in system status is not easily discovered.\n2. Not all configuration options are exposed in the UI\n3. 🤔 While we ultimately want users to adopt application security by integrating security tests into their CI/CD pipelines, we've seen [research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/790) that suggest this may be too big of an ask for some teams. \n    1. 💡 Would the concept of on-demand \"security pipelines\" be a more approachable intro for those teams?

header and tabs in MR diff view","description":"### Background\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340761 we made a change to the view of the merge request **Changes** tab (`/diffs`) to always be full-width and have the diffs use all available space.\n\nBefore, diffs were only full-width when the file browser was open or when using the “side-by-side” mode.\n\n\n\n### Problem\n\nTabs constantly shift between fluid and fixed if users go back and forth between tabs. From going through all the prior research in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1534, a _lot_ of developers tend to go back and forth between tabs like this. \n\n##### Feedback from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341931\n\n\u003e The change of location of the navigation bar is irritating to me. I usually toggle between \"Overview\" and \"Changes\". This change makes it harder to toggle between these two as I need to re-adjust my eyes every time and we don't have shortcuts to go to these pages.\n\n\u003e I like to see the diffs in full width, but it can be jarring when switching tabs.\n\n### Proposal\n\nFrom @psimyn's [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341931#note_693452370): Add the fixed container back to the header and tabs. It doesn't look great (and it was our previous behavior for side-by-side and file tree views), but it will alleviate any frustration users are feeling from the tabs jumping around.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_12.13.40_PM](/uploads/d2b29f333686888c3bb2788abb749204/Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_12.13.40_PM.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-13T18:14:55.703Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T15:55:39.303Z","closed_at":"2021-10-19T10:15:11.714Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":201566,"username":"annabeldunstone","name":"Annabel Dunstone Gray","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/85c0203926134720f9a9aa8c6e264c78?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/annabeldunstone"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343042","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343042","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343042/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343042/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343042","relative":"#343042","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343042"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95376209,"iid":343041,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make Gemnasium scan, report PHP Composer dev dependencies","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

This behaviour is inconsistent.\n\n### Proposal \n\n- Change the dependency file parser that handles `composer.lock` to make it process both `packages` and `packages-dev` when [`opts.IncludeDev` is set to true](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/9b6cfb45c895a361aea8f7d5c360d5d972a5e7e0/scanner/parser/composer/composer.go#L22). This is a trivial change since both share the same JSON structure, and `packages` is already parsed.\n- Update the expected report for the `tests/php-composer` test project; it already contains development dependencies.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe file parser currently ignores `packages-dev`. See [scanner/parser/composer/composer.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/902483996dbf9b2664d70d8029c420d7e4fbce52/scanner/parser/composer/composer.go#L12).\n\nWe already have a test project with dev. dependencies. See [composer.json](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/php-composer/-/blob/e5dd2aa7c55a55bf719a24cf53a7cb682fed8f90/composer.json#L13) and [composer.lock](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/php-composer/-/blob/master/composer.lock#L1881).

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n## Problem\n\nFollow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/pipeline-authoring/-/issues/34\n\nToday the Web IDE is the primary option for editing .gitlab-ci.yml.\n\n![image](/uploads/ce067512a3d7c6fca1569c795a558ce3/image.png)\n\nThe pipeline editor is the primary solution for working with .gitlab-ci.yml file, we should make sure it is the primary action we present to our users when they want to edit their .gitlab-ci.yml.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nMake it easy to discover and use the best tool for editing a pipeline configuration in GitLab.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd the pipeline editor as an option to the split \"edit\" button and make it the primary option for editing .gitlab-ci.yml files.\n\n| Split button with the pipeline editor selected by default | Dropdown with options |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/952bd3e06ed3e5b05ff777f8a7c09d9b/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/d4057bf184c33ace63c9a9f0fb0ce291/image.png)|\n\n- Pipeline editor should be the default option for editing for the .gitlab-ci.yml file.\n- When the project has set up a different file in their project to be used as their main config, we should show the pipeline editor as the main option for that file. In other words, it should be the primary option for the project pipeline file, regardless of whether it's `.gitlab-ci.yml` or some other path.\n- We should remember the user's preferred editor. So if they switch to Web IDE, we need to remember that and show Web IDE as the editor next time they open the file view. It's the current split button behavior throughout the product.\n\n### Metrics \n\nWe could track the usage of the pipeline editor option against the other options when clicked into from the file view.\n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track uage of this feature?
