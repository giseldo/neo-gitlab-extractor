When requesting the package, nuget.exe changes the version to all lowercase characters. In the file `app\\finders\\packages\\nuget\\package_finder.rb` it tries to match the version with the function `with_version` and this fails to find a matching version. If I add a function in the file `app\\models\\packages\\package.rb` like `scope :with_version_like, -\u003e (version) {where(arel_table[:version].matches(version)) }`. And then in the `package_finder.rb` file I use that function, then it will be able to find the packet and install it on the system.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T22:12:48.849Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T03:25:14.916Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T15:17:05.591Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","backend","customer","database","devops::package","group::package registry","missed-SLO","priority::3","ruby","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":6455279,"username":"hvandenwijngaerden","name":"Hans Vandenwijngaerden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/09221dc1d37fddb830a4ae6ab5eeaf04?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hvandenwijngaerden"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273664","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273664","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273664/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273664/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273664","relative":"#273664","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#273664"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7039,"epic":{"id":379187,"iid":7039,"title":"Key improvements for the NuGet repository","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7039","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73598906,"iid":273659,"project_id":278964,"title":"Gitlab.com is still vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing","description":"**[HackerOne report #1019578](https://hackerone.com/reports/1019578)** by `kkp_hackk9` on 2020-10-27, assigned to @rchan-gitlab:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\nGitlab.com is still vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing\n\n#####  Summary\n\nGitlab.com is still vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing in milestones, tags, issues, comments, etc.  I am able to bypass the fix we have made for below reported issues.  \n1. https://hackerone.com/reports/212629  \n2. https://hackerone.com/reports/211065  \n3. https://hackerone.com/reports/213114  \nI think we still should have implemented proper parsing mechanism to add rel=\u0026#34;nofollow noreferrer noopener\u0026#34; in links.\n\n#####  POC payload   \n \u0026lt;a target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;http:evil.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Reverse Tabnabbing\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce  \n1. Add above mentioned payload in any milestone, tag or comments and save it.  \n2. Inspect it in DOM, rel=\u0026#34;nofollow noreferrer noopener\u0026#34; would be missing for this particular payload. It would render as it is.  \n3.

I noticed this while performing different attack vectors.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nImprovement in parsing mechanism to include rel=\u0026#34;nofollow noreferrer noopener\u0026#34; in all external anchor links.\n\nPlease ping me if anything is unclear.\n\n####  Impact\n\nPlease note that impact here is pretty high as here attacker can easily able to exploit this on gitlab anywhere where HTML can be added.  \nVictim ends up being exploited by reverse tabnabbing\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T21:21:09.740Z","updated_at":"2022-02-13T14:03:34.285Z","closed_at":"2022-02-07T12:28:37.777Z","closed_by":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"labels":["HackerOne","Weakness::CAPEC-103","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273659","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273659","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273659/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273659/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273659","relative":"#273659","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#273659"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73598526,"iid":273655,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move the Dependency Proxy to Core","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen determining if a feature should be Paid-only or included in Core, we ask ourselves who benefits from this feature. When considering the Dependency Proxy, it's clear that proxying and caching images from Docker Hub is common practice for all types of organizations and buyers. \n\nIn fact, as we consider expanding this feature to allowing proxying and caching of packages from external repositories, such as npmjs.com or maven-central, this functionality should also be included in Core as these are common workflows for all individual contributors. \n\n### Proposal \n\nEnsure that proxying and caching images or packages from the most common public, remote repositories are included in Core, so that Developers can improve the reliability and performance of their builds. \n\n#### Supported repositories\n- Docker Hub\n- npmjs.com (proxying only)\n\n#### In the future we'll also support\n- NuGet.org\n- mvnrepository.com\n- pypi.org\n- conan-central\n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-\n\n### User experience goal\n- All GitLab users can reliably proxy and cache images from Docker Hub using the Dependency Proxy","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T21:05:15.426Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T18:05:34.983Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T16:16:04.274Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Proxy","GitLab Core","GitLab Premium","GitLab Starter","GitLab Ultimate","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273655","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273655","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273655/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273655/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273655","relative":"#273655","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#273655"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2920,"epic":{"id":33177,"iid":2920,"title":"Make the Dependency Proxy 'Complete'","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2920","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 21, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e11\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73597219,"iid":273651,"project_id":278964,"title":"Node 15 / npm 7 lockfile version 2 fails Gemnasium scan","description":"### Summary\n\nRunning Gemnasium on a Node project using npm 7's lockfileVersion: 2 throws the following error:\n\n```shell\n[FATA] [Gemnasium] [2020-10-29T19:02:20Z] ▶ Wrong file format version\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nGemnasium v2.25.0 only supports v1 of npm lock files, and v2 is a breaking change:\n- the `dependencies` object is similar to the one of v1, but top level objects no longer have a `version`\n- there's a new `packages` object that lists all the dependencies, including those are local to a package;

It was not clear that the analyzers only run if detected in the MR, even though the description to the `SAST Analyzers` area states this clearly. We want to encourage users to keep all of their analyzers on if possible so they get the most out of our SAST offering and don't miss any potential vulnerability findings.\n\n**Quotes**\n\nThe following is the feedback we received on this topic from GitLab team members, as part of the [SAST CMS study](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/67ef6cfd-02de-4644-bc07-c8d2194a0b1f/insights/present/85eb33fb-328e-46af-9e7e-5cf8780a36b8).\n\nP2, Security Engineer:\n\u003e I would tweak variables from the configuration UI... **I still have to do a lot of thinking of which analyzers are relevant**, etc... \n\n\u0026\n\nP6, Software Developer:\n\u003e **I may want to disable an analyzer if I know I'll never use it, or that they might consume CI resources**. My understanding is it needs to download a Docker package to detect the language.\n\n### Solution Validation (for internal usability testing)\n\nScenario: If you knew that there's no C/C++ in the project you're enabling SAST for, would you take any action from this SAST Configuration page? \n\nAssumption: Most users would want to uncheck (disable) `Flawfinder`.\n\nIdeal results: After user unchecks (disables) `Flawfinder`, they will see and read the alert above the `Create a Merge Request` button, and then decide to re-enable it.\n\n### Final proposal\n\nGiven the [results](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273628#note_453113957) of the internal usability test, let's proceed with the following alert if a user unchecks 1 or more of the analyzers in the SAST Configuration UI:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-11-30_at_11.08.13_AM](/uploads/7fd0210c4fdafd1649a354aefa7d09b5/Screen_Shot_2020-11-30_at_11.08.13_AM.png)\n\n\n/cc

this issue is to complete the UX work related to highlighting paid features during an active trial. \n \nThis work will piggyback off the work we've already completed where we created a badge to highlight paid features for free users. In that work we identified how this could potentially work within trials - [design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213376/designs/3.Trial-status--Badge_callout+popover.jpg#note_438459523). \n \n@kcomoli and I discussed this in our 1-1 and came to the following consensus: it would display on the highest element in the hierarchy. For example, let's say you're in a trial and you unlocked Analytics features, the badge would be next to the Analytics side-nav item, not on the elements underneath. If only an element within a stage got unlocked from the trial, for example, `required merge approvals` then the badge would only appear next to this component when a user is creating an MR.\n\n## Proposed solution\nWe will start by highlighting the Merge approval feature, when an admin creates a merge request we will display a badge and a popover in the MR page to highlight that the feature is temporarily accessible. Depending on the success of this experiment will iterate with the badge placement, the content of the popover and the features that we highlight during the trial period.  \n\n### Popover to

job creation retry doesn't always work in API Fuzzing","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen running an API Fuzzing test the `gl-apifuzzing-ci` script tries to create a new scan job with the API Fuzzing scan engine. On error it should retry in case the scan engine isn't fully available yet. However it has been seen to fail saying the scan engine is not initialized yet. This error prevents retrying the job creation.\n\nThis issue has only been seen once on GitLab.com sites. Retrying the job succeeded.\n\nIt's likely this issue will occur more often on a customer site with faster GitLab Runner infrastructure.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis issue is hard to reproduce as it's a race condition on the startup of the scan engine.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nJob creation is not retried and job fails.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nJob creation is retried and job succeeds.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nImprove the robustness of the job creation logic in `gl-apifuzzing-ci`. Consider using the same backoff module as `worker-entry`.\n\nThe `worker-entry` already verifies the scan engines ports are available. The retry logic in `gl-apifuzzing-ci` always retry with back off, returning the final exception as an error.\n\n/cc @sethgitlab @stkerr","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T15:48:00.278Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T21:07:05.844Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T21:07:05.752Z","closed_by":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"labels":["Category:Fuzz Testing","GitLab Ultimate","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","priority::3","section::sec","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":1212252,"iid":48,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 1-3 releases","description":"Issues which are not quite ready to schedule, but should be considered as part of the near-term roadmap.","state":"active","created_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273601","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273601","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273601/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273601/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273601","relative":"#273601","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#273601"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73584009,"iid":273593,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add cutoff styling to jobs in pipleine graph when they aren't connected","description":"It was pointed out that when a line goes under a job in the graph, it looks as if the line is connecting to the node and that we could add some kind of cutting of the line before and after the job connection to signal that the connection is just passing there, but isn't actually connected.\n\nI made an exploration of what it would look like to cutoff the lines which you can see below. \n\nThe one thing to note is that currently if you hover any job, the cutoff line reappears as faded out like all other lines. It doesn't cause confusion imo, but it's a technical limitation because we can't know which line crosses which jobs and there the cutoff is pretty naive. It works perfectly for when you don't hover, and when you hover it think of it this way:\n\n- If I hover on the job that has the cutoff, it stays\n- If I hover on any job, the cutoff is removed to make sure the hovered line is fully visible. Without that behavior, you would see the blue line also cutoff.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Before\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-29_at_11.12.18_AM](/uploads/4a2ce22f85318021c69189e5e5ed860c/Screen_Shot_2020-10-29_at_11.12.18_AM.png)\n\n![Screen_Recording_2020-10-29_at_11.12.22_AM](/uploads/65e4288f648a28c537488eebbe0c4f46/Screen_Recording_2020-10-29_at_11.12.22_AM.mov)\n\n### After\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-29_at_11.14.28_AM](/uploads/83bcf4d98f209a6d384f1a4c30a67df7/Screen_Shot_2020-10-29_at_11.14.28_AM.png)\n\n![Screen_Recording_2020-10-29_at_11.19.11_AM](/uploads/f25c84e1d1103321015c1665880a0078/Screen_Recording_2020-10-29_at_11.19.11_AM.mov)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T14:57:55.417Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T14:42:50.314Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T14:42:50.276Z","closed_by":{"id":5327378,"username":"f_caplette","name":"Frédéric Caplette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5327378/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/f_caplette"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Investigation: Decide if we can fix Cobertura report paths in the background","description":"\u003c!-- Instructions: Use this template for a proof of concept or when a deeper technical evaluation is required. Please weigh tech evaluation issues and follow the instructions below accordingly. --\u003e \n\n### Topic to Evaluate\n\nAs per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217664#note_434986155 we should investigate whether we can solve most of the pathing issues with cobertura reports in the background before we consider adding an external tool to parse the reports.\n\n\nThis might look like:\n\n1. Fetch build's `CI_PROJECT_DIR`. We will use this value to fix the absolute path of the `source` nodes in the XML and to come up with source paths that are relative to the project root only.\n1. Fetch `Ci::Pipeline#all_worktree_paths` and build a `Set` out of it for fast lookup of file paths.\n1. As we traverse each `class` node in the XML, we will form the path out of the `source` (with CI_PROJECT_DIR extracted out of it) and its `filename`, and then check the worktree set if the path exists, if it does then we will use it as the class' filename.\n\nSo far 2 uncertain parts here:\n\n1. I have not found a way to access `CI_PROJECT_DIR`, which is a CI/CD predefined variable, from the `Ci::Build.variables` when I was testing this locally on the Rails console. But if we would like to go with this route, then making it available is a good first step here.\n1. Is it safe to call `Ci::Pipeline#all_worktree_paths` on a huge project like for example GitLab.\n\nOverall, I like this option if we could get it to work because then users won't have to do anything new to get their cobertura files to work. We also don't have to increase their build time by rewriting their XML file with a CLI tool. We transfer the burden to our own background workers.\n\n\u003c!-- Describe the related issue and challenge we need to establish a proof of concept for--\u003e\n* [Link to other Issue](link)\n\n### Tasks to  Evaluate\n\n\u003c!-- Outline the tasks with issues that you need to evaluate as a part of the implementation issue --\u003e\n\n- [ ] Determine feasibility of the feature\n- [ ] Determine if we can access `CI_PROJECT_DIR` from `Ci:Build.variables`\n- [ ] Determine safety of calling `Ci::Pipeline#all_worktree_paths` on a gitlab-org/gitlab\n- [ ] Update proposal in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217664 \n\n### Risks and Implementation Considerations \n\n\u003c!-- Identify any risks found in the research, whether this is performance, impacts to other functionality or other bugs --\u003e\n\n### Team\n\n- [x] Add ~\"workflow::planning breakdown\" ~feature and the corresponding `~devops::\u003cstage\u003e` and `~group::\u003cgroup\u003e` labels.\n- [x] Ping the PM and EM.\n\n\n/cc @iamricecake @jheimbuck_gl","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T00:52:18.242Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T19:00:37.480Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T13:51:14.439Z","closed_by":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","needs investigation","section::ops","spike","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"}],"author":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273540","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":2},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273540","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273540/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273540/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273540","relative":"#273540","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#273540"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"},{"id":73545369,"iid":273530,"project_id":278964,"title":"Stop using root in container scanning analyzer","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nIn this release, we added support for a feature flag proxy. This proxy sits between the Feature Flag server and the client consuming the flag. This extends support for static web sites. The proxy solves performance issues since it caches the toggles and can easily scale up. It solves security concerns as all the user based decisions are done on the server side and for the single page use case, the proxy will make sure to send responses specific  and limitted to the logged in user.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a developer developing a static web site, I want the ability to use Feature Flags to toggle on/off features directly on my website/\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nCreate a proxy API endpoint for Unleash Feature flag requests (server) in GitLab that allows users to provide their unleash context and returns all feature flags and their resolved state (on/off)\n\n#### API Schema\n\nWe currently don't support variants, so providing `nil` for that field should be fine. The API should return a list of `IToggle`s\n\nMetrics are sent to `${baseUrl}/client/metrics`, so that endpoint should return `200 OK` to support the client.\n\n```typescript\nexport interface IVariant {\n    name: string;\n    payload?: {\n        type: string,\n        value: string,\n    };\n}\n\nexport interface IToggle {\n    name: string;\n    enabled: boolean;\n    variant: IVariant;\n}\n\ninterface IResopnse {\n  data: Array\u003cIToggle\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThe proxy solves three important aspects:\n\n**Performance**– The proxy will cache all toggles in memory, and will be running on the edge, close to your end-users. A single instance will be able to handle thousands of request/sec, and you can scale it easily by adding additional instances.\n\n**Security** – The proxy evaluates the feature flags for the user on the server-side, and only exposes the results of enabled feature flags for a specific user.\n\n**Privacy** – If you run the proxy yourself (we can host it as well though) we will not see your end users. This means that you still have full control of your end-users, the way it should be!\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

parent/child pipeline cancellation","description":"follow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208411#note_433793672\n\nDuring the discussion about canceling interruptible jobs for child pipeline @fabiopitino wrote on his comment\n\n\u003e If it makes sense we could split this into 2 issues (1) related manually canceling the pipeline and (2) related to the `interruptible` jobs and auto-canceling a pipeline.\n\u003e \n\u003e To solve (1) we need to change the [definition of `Ci::Pipeline#cancel_running`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/3ee27fd76c43522a999d734bb56d82416f2f4b54/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb#L539):\n\u003e \n\u003e * should we cancel all the cancelable jobs in the parent pipeline and its child pipelines? - cancelable jobs are those not yet completed\n\u003e * should we cancel all the cancelable jobs in the parent pipeline and the child pipelines with `strategy:depend`? - does it make sense to cancel child pipelines that run detached from the parent?\n\nthis issue is to explore how should we cascade child pipeline when canceling a parent pipeline\n\n## Solution\n\nWe need to ensure that both `Ci::Pipeline#cancel_running` and `Ci::Pipeline#auto_cancel_running` cascade the cancellation to child pipelines.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git

the Kubernetes Agent Server. Until recently, this required the Agent Server to be enabled manually.

Beside being enabled by default, the Kubernetes Agent Server accepts various configuration options to customize it according to your needs.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/#install-the-kubernetes-agent-server\n\n## Goal\n\nEnable the Agent server by default on Omnibus. \n\n## Definition of done\n\n- [ ] Update [Omnibus attributes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/blob/master/files/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab/attributes/default.rb#L521) to set kas default enabled to true\n- [ ] Figure out Lets Encrypt/SSL config\n  - [ ] Test and document no SSL configuration\n  - [ ] Test and document bring your own SSL configuration\n  - [ ] Test and document Lets Encrypt SSL configuration\n- [ ] Document resource requirements for the user (memory, CPU etc).

improved from the UX perspective, which are outlined below.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- [x] This new sort dropdown does not appear to be using our updated [GitLab UI components](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-dropdown--default). Example of new components on production can be seen [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/requirements_management/requirements). This includes styling adjustments for accessibility purposes.\n- [x] Can we update the \"Relevant\" option to be titled \"Most Relevant\"\n- [x] Sorting by creation date is titled \"Created date\" in other areas of our product. Here, we are calling it \"Last created\" and \"Oldest created\" (depending on the sort order). This creates a couple problems - inconsistency with other areas of our product, as well as a scenario where the option shown (\"Oldest created\") is not actually shown in the dropdown (see screenshot below). I suggest we update the title of this to be \"Created date\", and handle displaying the current sort order within a tooltip associated to that button (as seen [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/requirements_management/requirements?page=1\u0026state=opened\u0026sort=created_desc) as an example on production)\n\n| title issue | sort tooltip |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.22.22_PM](/uploads/6da2b4545f891fe7042acf7e3f7cadd3/Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.22.22_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.31.25_PM](/uploads/8e4b972c45e8cb0503acec82a3a4ff48/Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.31.25_PM.png) |\n\n- [ ] The dropdown menu currently appears to stem from the sort button, where I believe it should actually start at the right side of the dropdown element (based off [documentation here](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdowns#behavior)). This is also how it appears to work on things like [issue lists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?sort=created_date).\n\n| current | seen elsewhere |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.21.59_PM](/uploads/af9156b433e40820b472d4f5a7206ce2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.21.59_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.22.07_PM](/uploads/09182bed2febd11b635d5a4787f77582/Screen_Shot_2020-10-27_at_2.22.07_PM.png) |\n\n- [ ] There are some styling issues here with the dropdown, where the left side has no border radius while the right side does.

That can be done in a few ways. Two options I (and `@mbergeron` though of):\n\n1. We will need to handle determining if the migration has run when doing Issues searches. This will tell if the combined or separated issue index should be used for the query. That could be done before each issues search by looking in the `_migrations` index and caching the ES migration status for subsequent calls.\n1.

This was because searching these results would have to reference the much larger index with everything in it. \n\nWe have split issues into their own index separate from the rest of the GitLab Index. This results in 50% faster Issue searching.  This migration will happen automatically. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_global_search.html\n\nTITLE:  50% Faster Issue Searching with Advanced

Summary \n\nIn 13.0, we introduced the ability for project repository storage be moved via the use of the [ProjectRepositoryStorageMove](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/project_repository_storage_move.rb) model and associated table ([docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_repository_storage_moves.html#project-repository-storage-moves-api)).\n\nAs part of the epic to support the same behaviour for Snippet repositories (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3393), we have added a new DB table replicating the structure we have for Projects, `snippet_repository_storage_moves` (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218984).\n\nIn [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46231#note_436901288), `@fjsanpedro` highlighted a potential change to our approach and the DB structure, so we have the common data stored in one table (whilst avoiding STI).\n\nThis issue is to investigate a potential solution, the implications and whether or not we should proceed.\n\n### Potential solution\n\nAfter a discussion, we think this could likely be achieved by moving the common columns into a new table, `repository_storage_moves` (name TBC!), which would involve something like:\n\n* Create new `repository_storage_moves` table\n  * With columns: state, source_storage_name, destination_storage_name\n* Modify `project_repository_storage_moves` and `snippet_repository_storage_moves`\n  * Remove the now unused columns (state, source_storage_name, destination_storage_name)\n  * Add FK for `repository_storage_moves`\n* Refactor `ProjectRepositoryStorageMove` to `has_one: :repository_storage_move` and delegate to that new class\n\n(Note: as yet, the `snippet_repository_storage_moves` table is unused)\n\n**Benefits of adopting this solution:**\n\n* Reduces duplication\n* Makes future extension of this feature easier to implement (e.g. when this same support is added to wikis)\n* ~~Continues to [avoid STI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/single_table_inheritance.html)~~ Edit: the current approach already avoids STI so I'm not sure this is a benefit :thinking: \n\n**Downsides of adopting this solution:**\n\n* Migrating data from `project_repository_storage_moves`, which will probably involve something like:\n  1. create `repository_moves` table\n  1. add FK column to `project_repository_storage_moves` with index\n  1. update code to use new table \n  1. mark old table columns as ignored (as part of the above point, possibly)\n  1. move existing data to `repository_storage_moves` and reference in `project_repository_storage_moves.repository_move_id`\n  1. remove old columns\n  1. ...there is likely more steps / different order, TBC after some :thinking:\n* Adding `ProjectUpdateRepositoryStorageWorker` sidekiq worker multi-version support\n* API updates (maybe? further investigation needed here)\n\n**Risks of _not_ adopting this approach:**\n\n* Two tables with similar structures and uses\n* Eventually wikis (and maybe other repository containers in future) will add a third\n* Tables could potentially become out of sync (if someone modifies `projects_repository_storage_moves` table but not the snippet one)\n\n**Additional notes / considerations:**\n\nThe `project_repository_storage_moves` table has 93396 rows at the time of writing\n\nThe existing implementation uses a sidekiq worker, [`ProjectUpdateRepositoryStorageWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/workers/project_update_repository_storage_worker.rb), so we'd possibly need to leverage [sidekiq versioning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sidekiq_style_guide.html#versioning) if we were to proceed :thinking:\n\n\n**Known unknowns:**\n\nSome things I'm unsure of at the moment:\n\n1. ~~The time impact of implementing this solution - I _think_ it would need to be a multi-release change?~~\n1. Possibly import/export implications if over multiple releases?\n1. ~~Would this sort of data migration require the use of a background migration? (I suspect so)~~\n\n**Release schedule for this change:**\n\nRelease 1:\n\n* Add DB table.\n* Modify the old models to sync data to the new DB table (using upserts maybe) in an `after_save` callback.\n* Prepare an inline DB migration to copy the existing data (should be safe since we have low record count).\n\nRelease 2:\n\n* At this point we can assume that both tables are in sync.\n* Cutover, update models and workers to use the new table.\n* Note: you might need to bump the worker version or make them backward compatible (if the argument list changes)\n\nRelease 3:\n\n* Cleanup old tables.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-27T17:29:15.615Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T07:54:42.076Z","closed_at":"2020-11-06T07:54:42.007Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273220","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273220","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273220/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/273220/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273220","relative":"#273220","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#273220"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73473111,"iid":273208,"project_id":278964,"title":"[VSA] Add averages to VSA table to supplement medians","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nValue Stream Analytics was originally implemented to display medians.  Medians were chosen because they exclude \"outliers\" - extremely high or low values that skew averages.  However, there are some problems with using medians:\n\n- Unfamiliarity:  Generally, people are more familiar with averages than medians, and find averages easier to understand.  This is true to the extent that we have an issue about how it is [unclear that metrics are medians](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213164), even though the column is clearly labeled \"Median\"!\n- Unexpectedness:  People familiar with devops analytics expect to see averages; as @hdelalic [has mentioned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233723#note_436988715): \"cycle time, throughput, velocity, and other predictive measures are always expressed as averages\" .\n- Inadequacy: Although medians were chosen to exclude the influence of extreme values, we have found many cases where the majority of values are extreme.  In these cases, median is worse than useless - it feels misleading.  For example, there was a case where 11 of 20 items in a stage had a median of 0, so the stage median was 0.  Again in [the words of @hdelalic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233723#note_436988715): \"in sets like this one where more than a half of the values \"sits\" in one of the extremes

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nAllow_failure keyword will prevent a failed job to fail an entire pipeline, previously allow_failure accepts only binary value (true or false), in this release, we enhanced the allow_failure keyword to accept different exit code of a job, this will allow you to have better control on when to prevent the pipeline to fail base on the job exits codes.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWe've had an internal meeting about how to proceed on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16733 and we feel like the issue is too broad and both of the proposals mentioned in there are complex and will affect the simplicity/reliability of the whole system. We should keep how we mark a build as failed or successful as simple as possible and if we can make it even more simple and even more reliable. But we should not change it in a way that it makes it more brittle and error prone.\n\nThe overall conclusion was to start with something simple that augments [`allow_failure`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#allow_failure) to accept a list of exit codes for which the job will be marked as `passed with warnings`.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template.

duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nSometimes, when using push options to create a merge request with a specified target branch, Git reports that the branch does not exist even though it definitely does.\n\nThe problem was discovered by [an automated E2E QA test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2329d705350686759da0d592e2d5e7acc065844f/qa/qa/specs/features/api/3_create/merge_request/push_options_target_branch_spec.rb). See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254951\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Use a script or run the automated test to quickly execute the commands.\n1. Push a new branch.\n1. Use push options to create a merge request with a specific target branch.\n1. Repeat until it fails\n\nFor example, the automated test uses the Git CLI to create a branch and push it\n\n```\ngit checkout -b \"push-options-test-target-b5dc59c51402f7b7\"\n# add and commit files\ngit push\n```\n\nAnd then confirms that the branch exists by cloning the project in a separate directory and checking out the branch.\n\n```\n$ cd /new/tmp/dir\n$ git clone ...\nCloning into '.'...\n\n$ git checkout  \"push-options-test-target-b5dc59c51402f7b7\"\nSwitched to a new branch 'push-options-test-target-b5dc59c51402f7b7'\n```\n\nIt then tries to use push options to create a merge request against a specific target branch:\n\n```\ngit push -o merge_request.create \\\n         -o merge_request.title=\"MR push options test 88af550668bb1657\" \\\n         -o

gl-apifuzzing-runner to csharp","description":"### Problem\n\nAPI Fuzzing has a python script `gl-apifuzzing-runner` that consumes various static definition files converting them into HTTP requests and sending them to the API Fuzzing scanner.\n\nThis worked great at first, however the features of `gl-apifuzzing-runner` are expanding and will require code duplication if kept as a python script. Also, long term, generating HTTP requests from definition files will need to move into the scanner core. By rewriting the runner in csharp we will be ready for the integration.\n\nThe following commands will be migrated:\n\n| Command | Migrate |\n|---------|---------|\n| burp    | No |\n| cmd     | No |\n| folder  | No |\n| har     | Yes |\n| postman | Yes |\n| swagger | Yes |\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a new command line csharp tool that implements the existing `runner` functionality in csharp. The implementation will leverage existing work and classes from the `Peach.Web` project. The implementation will also make use of existing dependencies used by `PeachWeb` such as `NSwag` for OpenAPI/Swagger support, and the Newtonsoft json library.\n\n1. Add a new command line csharp application `Peach.Web.Runner`\n   1. Executable name `gl-apifuzzing-runner`\n1. Use the same command line arguments and commands\n   1. See https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline\n\nInternally the requests will end up as `Peach.Web.Core.Models.WebApi.Operation` objects. This will include\ncreating `EndPoint` and `Resources` objects as well. These `WebApi` models what the scanning engine operates on. In the future this new `runner` code will be integrated and these models will be operated on directly.\n\nThe `WebApi` is modeled after REST API concepts and language used by the OpenAPI specifications.\n\nTo send the requests through the scanner proxy, convert `Operations` into the standard csharp web client. Multipart messages must be supported.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  HAR --\u003e Operation --\u003e HttpClient\n```\n\n#### Runner Overview\n\nThe purpose of `runner` is to allow testing of static requests from supported file formats. This is done by sending the requests provided by a support file format repeatedly using the scan engine as a proxy.\n\nHigh level internal logic:\n\n1. Convert static file into an array of requests\n   1. Update with base url if provided via `--base-url`\n   1. Update headers if provided via `--header` (note- multiple `--header` options can be provided)\n1. Start a new test session if we are running stand alone\n1. For each request in requests\n   1. Tell `PeachWeb` a new request is being tested\n   1. Do\n      1. Update request with overrides.\n         1. Overrides can change over time if an `--overrides_cmd` is provided\n      1. Send request via `PeachWeb` proxy port\n   1. While `PeachWeb` says `continue`\n\n`runner` has two modes of operation: stand alone, or in conjunction with `gl-apifuzzing-ci`. When running standalone the `runner` will create a new scan job and then send the requests through the proxy. When used by `gl-apifuzzing-ci` the runner will not create a new job. \n\nThe method of use can be detected by looking for the following environment variables:\n\n1. `FUZZAPI_SESSIONID` - This provides the job id needed to call the `PeachWeb` APIs\n1. `FUZZAPI_PROXY` - This provides the proxy URL used when sending requests\n\n##### CLI Options\n\nHere are the existing CLI options. All of the long form parameters (`--api`, `--header`, etc.) can also be provided as environment variables with the `FUZZAPI_` prefix. So for `--api foo` you could set `FUZZAPI_API=foo`. This is handled automatically by the python `click` module the options are defined using. If possible I would like to support environment variables in the csharp version, but it's not a must have.\n\n```\nUsage: gl-apifuzzing-runner [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  Run one or more commands that generate traffic through API Fuzzing.\n\nOptions:\n  --ci / --no-ci              Running from CI script, ensure no auto start.\n  -a, --api TEXT              API Fuzzing API URL. Defaults to FUZZAPI_API\n                              environ.\n  -p, --project TEXT          API Fuzzing project to use. Ex. Default\n  -r, --profile TEXT          API Fuzzing profile to use. Ex.

The document is provided through a command line option `--overrides_env={...}`, a file on disk `--overrides=filename`, or a combination of file on disk, command, and run interval.\n\nWhen the user provides a command to run, the command is expected to update the overrides json file when it runs. This feature is provided to handle cases where authentication tokens expire. When using a command the following options are required:\n\n1. `--overrides` - Profile a filename\n1. `--overrides_cmd` - Provides a command line to execute\n1. `--overrides_interval` - Interval in minutes to run the command\n\nThe command is run before sending any requests to create the initial json file. Then in the background every N minutes.\n\nOne of the design goals for overrides is providing a simple, small format that can be provided easily through an environmental variable. \n\nThe current format used by the python runner will be extended for the csharp runner to include several optional properties: `query`, `body-form`, `body-json`, `body-xml`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"headers\":    { \"name\": \"value\"  }, \n  \"cookies\":    { \"name\": \"value\"  },\n  \"query\":      { \"name\": \"value\"  },\n  \"body-form\":  { \"name\": \"value\"  },\n  \"body-json\":  { \"jsonpath\": \"value\" },\n  \"body-xml\" :  { \"xpath\":    \"value\" }\n}\n```\n\n1. Changing a header\n\n   ```json\n   { \"header\": {\"Authorization\": \"Token b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\"} }\n   ```\n\n1. Parameter in query string\n\n   ```json\n   { \"query\": {\"api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\"} }\n   ```\n\n1. Parameter in form encoded body\n\n   ```json\n   { \"body-form\": {\"api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\"} }\n   ```\n\n1. Parameter in json encoded body\n\n   The parameter key is a JSONPath expression.\n\n   ```json\n   { \"body-json\": {\"$.api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\"} }\n   ```\n\n1. Parameter in xml encoded body\n\n   The parameter key is an xpath expression.\n\n   Set value to all xml elements named `api_key`:\n\n   ```json\n   { \"body-xml\": {\"//api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\"} }\n   ```\n\n   Set value to all attributes named `api_key`:\n\n   ```json\n   { \"body-xml\": {\"//@api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\"} }\n   ```\n\n1. Changing multiple parameters\n\n   When changing multiple parameters, additional properties are added.\n\n   ```json\n   { \n     \"body-json\": {\n       \"$.api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\",\n       \"$.other\": \"some other value\"\n     } \n   }\n   ```\n\n1. Changing a header and parameter\n\n   ```json\n   { \n     \"header\": { \"X-Special-Header\": \"XYZ\" },\n     \"body-json\": {\n       \"$.api_key\": \"b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3\",\n       \"$.other\": \"some other value\"\n     } \n   }\n   ```\n\n#### HTTP Archive (HAR)\n\n1. Only one version v1.2 is supported\n1. Support loading as local file and URL\n\n#### OpenAPI\n\n1. Support both v2.0 and v3 OpenAPI specification formats\n1. Support both local files and also URLs to load the specification\n1. Use example/default data for operations if provided in the specification\n\n#### Postman\n\n1. Support both v2.0 and v2.1 Postman Collection types\n1. Support nested item groups\n1. Support loading by file name and URL\n\n##### Postman variables overrides\nIn order to support postman variables. There are two possible sources for the values of postman variables. They can be specified thru environmental variables: \n\n* `FUZZAPI_POSTMAN_COLLECTION` Contains a file path to a postman file.\n* `FUZZAPI_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` contains a file path to a json file. The JSON file is a collection of key-value pais, for example: `{ \"var_name1\" : \"value_1\", \"var_name2\" : \"value_2\" }` \n\nWhen the runner is converting Postman request into `Operation` and it finds a variable reference.
