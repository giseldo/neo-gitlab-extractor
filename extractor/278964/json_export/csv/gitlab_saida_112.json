(UPDATE - can't do user id today, will add in future)\n- pipeline `\"pipeline_id\"`\n- project `\"project_id\"`\n- instance\n- tier (ultimate, gold, core, etc)\n\npseudo-anonymized is fine, we want to be able to know they are \"unique\" but not know \"who\"\n\nMake a list (to create follow on items) for any snowplow metrics that do *not* contain one of the above attributes\n\nIf there is an easy way in DBT to join project to get tier and instance we can skip those.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve?

Removing `.utc` from the `timestamp` will log in either the default UTC, or if a different timezone is set, would log in that timezone, however , would show the timezone offset, whereas before, it would only show without the offset.\n\nThis does not change what is logged in the database either. When viewing the audit logs in the UI, `/admin/audit_logs`, all entries show UTC timezone formatted date/time. Changing the timezone of the database server has no effect, as the structure is `created_at     | timestamp without time zone`. I believe `created_at` column would need to be adjusted to be `timestamptz` to work.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOn an Omnibus installation, set `gitlab_rails['time_zone'] = 'America/Chicago'`, then run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`. Also, set the system time, in my case being on Ubuntu, `dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`.\n\nRestart GitLab with `sudo gitlab-ctl restart`.\n\n`tail -f /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/audit_json.log`, then sign into the instance.

See also https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/commits/no_dind-DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/commits/qa-with-DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE.\n\n## Improvements\n\n- leverage the documented variable `DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE` introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39875/diffs#note_399572481\n- simply the CI configuration of the test projects by removing analyzer-specific variables like `GEMNASIUM_IMAGE`\n\n## Risks\n\nIf not properly handled, this change might break the pipeline of the DS analyzer project. There's not risk to break user-facing features.\n\n## Involved components\n\n- Dependency Scanning [analyzers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers)\n- the [test projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests) they use\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\nNone\n\n/cc @gonzoyumo @NicoleSchwartz

unexpected behavior as it could transform user data before displaying it in the UI.\n\nThere are a few approaches we can take to address this:\n\n1. ~frontend receives unescaped data from ~backend and use editor (monaco?) to render it.\n1. ?\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nPlease run `package-and-qa` on MR(s) for regression

of changes","description":"Quality has recently built a new SiteSpeed pipeline to start testing various pages across the application in a lab like setting to find any browser performance rendering issues, much like we already do for server issues.\n\nOne page that is a clear offender is the Merge Request Changes page, which has a notably heavy hit on the browser - especially when the amount of changes are are higher:\n\n```\nNAME                                  | FCP (ms) | LCP (ms)         | TBT (ms)         | SI (ms) | LVC (ms) | TFR SIZE (kb) | SCORE |

page being tested as part of the same test data we use with GPT on our [10k Reference Architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/10k_users.html) from a client machine running SiteSpeed (Chrome) with the specs of a 4 core CPU and 16GB RAM. The page being targets is for a large but realistic merge request of 678+ files and +24260 -11587 changes. Of note a customer is [reporting similarly bad performance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229164#note_402439354) with a smaller MR as performance looks to be based on what's visable on the viewport.\n\nQuality are still in the process of codifying official rendering performance targets for us to target with GitLab's pages but as this page is such a clear offender it's better to start the process for this now rather than later. At this time the [proposed targets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/issues/288#note_383768372), based on [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), are as follows:\n\n* `LCP` - [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/) reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport. Recommended target - [2500ms](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-is-a-good-lcp-score).\n* `TBT` - [Total Blocking Time (LCP)](https://web.dev/tbt/) measures the total amount of time where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness. Recommended target - [300ms](https://web.dev/tbt/#what-is-a-good-tbt-score).\n\nAs shown above the page is notably breaking these thresholds. Much like GTP issues this issue may be closed once notable progress has been made and then another raised to show progress if desired.\n\nFinally as a suggestion we may want to look at imposing limits on this page much like we do for File Blobs (and being proposed for [File Blame](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225174)) for extremely large MRs.\n\n# Relevant notes\n\n* In the tests, it seems like some runs have the File Tree open. Could there be a bug in the product making this non-deterministic?  :thinking:","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-28T09:20:34.307Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T18:04:47.897Z","closed_at":"2020-12-21T19:20:21.794Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","Quality","bug::performance","devops::create","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::code review","merge requests","performance-refinement","section::dev","severity::1","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":3769272,"username":"grantyoung","name":"Grant Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3769272/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/grantyoung"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241841","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241841","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241841/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241841/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#241841","relative":"#241841","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#241841"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70407382,"iid":241832,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Add Basic Redis HLL module\" Add tests","description":"The following discussion from !39689 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @lulalala started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39689#note_403658448): \n\n    \u003e @alinamihaila could you add spec for this method?

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDevelopers do not have an easy way to get the history of if a test has recently been passing, failing or skipped as they research a test failure in the context of a test run in an MR.\n\nWithout this context it is hard to point at why the build is feeling/getting slower and what test cases may to be blame for that. Without that context it's not hard to imagine Delaney and Sasha starting to skip tests and not write tests for new code.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to use the UI with GitLab to see if a test has passed or failed more often over the last N executions in the default branch in the test summary.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis is an MVC proposal to measure if there is interest / value in this feature. If there is we will likely re-architect this to be more scalable and functional going forward.\n\n* Count failures by test for any test execution in the project on the default `branch`\n    * We changed course to use the `default` branch for comparison and realize it may limit what we can learn in the MVC but the implementation was made easier so we can learn faster.\n    * If a job/pipeline generates a lot of errors (TBD how many by Back end developer) Stop counting and do not increment the count for existing tests. This is likely the result of something else that went wrong and this would lead to noisy data for users. For Example the database was down so all the tests are failing, we shouldn't count that as a test failure.\n* This data will be sent along with the test case entity already used by the Test Summary Widget.\n* Display how many times a test has failed over the last X days (history of the test) for each failed test that has a previous failure recorded in the /default branch.\n* Track expansions of the Test Summary widget as a snowplow event we can display in the [group dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/633395/Testing-Category-Metrics).\n\n##### Application Logic\n\n###### Backend\n\nAfter parsing a JUnit XML report file, if:\n\n1. The feature flag is enabled for this project\n1. The file contains less than 200 total failures\n\nWe will increment a persisted counter for each test that failed.\n\n---\n\nWe will create an endpoint/method that will retrieve a count of how many times a test has failed in the last 14 days.\n\n###### Frontend\n\nUpon loading the MR page, if:\n\n1. The feature flag is enabled for this project\n1. The JUnit XML report file is done processing\n1. The JUnit XML report file contains failures\n1. The JUnit XML report failures are loaded into the MR widget\n\nWe will build the recent failures data into the data for the MR Widget, then draw the tooltips on the frontend with that information.\n\n#### Postgres\n\nWe will store the failures and test cases in the database in tables like:\n\n```\nci_test_cases(project_id, test_case_name)\n\nhas_many\n\nci_test_case_failures(ci_test_case_id, failed_at, ref)\n```\n\nThen query those tables to create the necessary endpoints as described here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241759#note_417521675\n\n* For the `test_case_name` we'll need a reasonable limit (text limit).\n* I suppose `failed_at` is needed for doing statistical calculations, since the same data is probably available in one of the CI tables.\n* For inserting records in batches, check out: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/insert_into_tables_in_batches.html\n* It might make sense at some point to aggregate and store the failure counts (last 14 days) on the `ci_test_cases` table.\n\n\nOther possible technical implementations are discussed here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235525#note_394298215\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nBefore investing in time to architect a real solution for this to start on the epic for [Testing History for MRs and Pipelines](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4155) or even the MVC for [Test History for Projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210250) we will validate that there is value and move the feature forward with this MVC. We fully expect not to re-use code and maybe interface built as part of this issue as we learn what is valuable.\n\nThe ~backend should be complete in this issue, which should then be re-usable in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235525 which only has a ~frontend label.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Add a note to [existing documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html#how-it-works) that number of times a test has failed previously is now inclued.\n* Update the screenshot for the newly refined UI.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n* Test execution data is tracked for all failed tests and displayed on the test summary MR Widget\n* MR can still load as quickly as it does today\n* Opens of the Test Summary Widget are tracked - A [separate issue has been created for this]\n\n```\nGIVEN a junit artifact is uploaded during an MR pipeline run\nGIVEN there is at least one failed test in the junit report artifact\nWHEN you visit the MR page\nWHEN you expand the test summary in the MR widget section\nTHEN there exists a tooltip beside the failing test indicating how many times its' failed recently\n```\n#### Measures of Success\n* This feature will be successful if there are at least 500 opens of the test widget per week the first full week 30 days after launch.\n* This feature will be successful if we collect any feedback from internal and external users within 45 days of launch to inform the next iteration.\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nThe buyer for this is the developer who wants to see how a test is behaving previously to inform their current MR.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\nFeedback for this MVC will be collected in the [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/242233).\n\n### Follow-up Issues to create:\n\n- [ ] Create daily clean-up job to ensure failure table has 14 days of data only\n- [ ] Add per-pipeline limit of 1000 failures stored\n- [ ] Add per-project limit of 100k failures stored at once\n- [ ] Aggregate failures in last 14 days in background job and persist into ci_test_case table to avoid expensive GROUP BY COUNT queries\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones

Without a visual aid, it could be impossible to form a mental image of all the dependencies between countless jobs. In our first iteration of pipeline visualization, you can now see a graphic representation of your .gitlab-ci.yml file. Then you can decide for yourself if a picture really is worth a thousand words. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html\n\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nA `.gitlab-ci.yml` file can be difficult to understand, even for the original author if it is a complex CI configuration. Without a visualization of the pipeline that is created by a yml file, it could be hard to imagine how the pipeline might behave.  \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* Any user trying to understand a CI yml file without running the pipeline\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhen a user is viewing (not editing) a CI yaml file in a [simple editor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) they should have the option to see a graphic representation of the file.\n\n### Proposal\n\nTranslate the .gitlab-ci.yml file into a graphic visualization when viewing the static, checked-in file in the simple editor (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml). \n\nThis first iteration of the feature is a view only representation with these elements:\n- From the static view of .gitlab-ci.yml file, add method for user to click to a graphical visualization of the file\n- Show stages and differentiate between stages with jobs and those without\n- Show jobs under the stage to which they belong\n- Show dependency between jobs (those using `needs` keyword) with a visual connecting line\n\nSee **Design** section for most current illustrations.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis graph is built to replace the current pipeline graph eventually once it is prove to work well. There first effort to use thi graph as the new pipeline view is being made in a spike here:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249094\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes - yes, there should be unit test for new added logics\n* Integration test changes - yes, there should be frontend integration tests to make sure components are rendered\n* End-to-end test change - not required\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe verbose pip output demonstrates that pip replaces the periods in the package name with dashes when searching for the package. This is compliant behaviour with PEP-503: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/#normalized-names Pip has expected compliance with PEP-503 since the release of pip 8.1.2, back in 2016. Attempting to access the package directly, retaining the period in the name, resolves as expected: https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/20767841/packages/pypi/simple/my.pypipackage/ It therefore appears that the Gitlab pypi repository is not PEP-503 compliant, and the required resolution would be to normalize package names on upload. Periods in package names are both permissible (https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#name), and advised for namespace packages, as per PEP-423 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0423/).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-27T06:16:34.172Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T09:43:57.233Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T13:34:16.368Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve

This is problematic because when DockerHub is down is when it's more important than ever to be able to pull images from the cache so that you don't experience any downtime. \n\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n- Users have confidence that if they use the Dependency Proxy and DockerHub is down that they won't be impacted by the outage. (assuming their image has been previously cached)\n\n\n### Proposal\nRemove the limitation of the Dependency Proxy that DockerHub is available. If DockerHub is down and a requested image exists in the cache, we will pull it from the cache. \n\n### Further details\n- This is a key requirement for us to dogfood the feature and to reduce our reliance on external dependencies. \n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this change.\n\n### Documentation\n- [Remove limitation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#limitations)\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like users are able to use the proxy to improve their reliability and efficiency. \n- Measure the cache hit ratio. (issue to add instrumentation to the dependency proxy https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238056)\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n- This will be a Premium feature\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature?

Adding these in as tabs to the current experience could start pushing the bound of usability. How might we make this experience more flexible for future options?\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers are able to quickly configure a board with lists that provide value to them and their team.\n\n### Proposal\n\n-  Move the options `Label` `Assignee` and `Milestone` out of the Add list dropdown and into their own respective `New list` widgets. Add `Iterations` as a list type as well.\n- `Health status` and `Epic`  are future scope.\n\n- See more information and resources about the larger experience in [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4287).\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003csummary\u003e :movie_camera: Notes on the interactions here\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- User can add a new list/column from the header as is the current experience (small change, discoverable- future scope can be validating the `add` being to the right of the workflow)\n   - Change name of the `Add list` button to `Create list`\n- On click of the `Create list` button, the `New list`:\n   - The board scrolls to the end of the lists (to the right edge at the end).\n   - The `New list` widget slides in from right to left and appear to the right of the `Closed` list or last list (at the end of the board). \n   - The `Create list` button is now disabled with a tooltip on hover explaining that a user should finish adding their first list before trying to add another.\n- The default column/list type is `Label`, but the user can change the type from the list/column itself via the dropdown.\n   - If the user changes the list type, the copy and content in the header and body of the widget is contextual to the type being added.\n   - If the user adds some information into one list type, navigates to another list type, then back to the previous type- the information they entered is stored and available. Scenario: User adds `Abby A`  to their assignee list and then switches to a label list. They then immediately switch back to assignee, and `Abby A` is still selected.\n- Once the required information is inputed, the `Add` button is enabled and the user can add the list to their board.\n- The user sees the column/list added to the board. \n   - I would love us to display some styling of the list adding to the board. Maybe a flash of a blue focus state around the list fading in and out.\n   - Optionally we could also add a toast here to further reenforce this.\n- If the user tries to navigate away from the board when the `New list` widget is open, a dialog appears asking them to confirm they want to navigate away without saving changes.\n\n###### Classic board\n- The board scrolls horizontally. The `New list` widget can be scrolled away from.\n\n###### Swimlanes board\n- The board scrolls horizontally and vertically, with swimlanes fixes. The `New list` widget appears to the right of the `closed` list and last swimlane. This will cause the swimlane titles to truncate to before this widget. \n- The user can still scroll horizontally and vertically but the `New list` widget is fixed to the right of the board and does not scroll away or scroll vertically.\n\n##### General walkthrough\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/817edbe1d27649a0ac632601c71986d9\"\u003e \u003cp\u003eCreate/Add list improvements walkthrough - Watch Video\u003c/p\u003e \u003cimg style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/817edbe1d27649a0ac632601c71986d9-with-play.gif\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n#### Iterations \n\n- [x] Add `:board_new_list` feature flag https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52869\n- [x] Move Label lists to New list widget https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299487\n- [x] Create Iterations New list widget https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/250479\n- [x] Move Assignee lists to New list widget\n- [x] Move Milestone lists to New list widget\n\n### Artifacts\n\n- 🎨 **Figma specs:** [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/2QBP5WaSw13mwAKPvtIjCj/New-list-improvements?node-id=43%3A23673)\n\n\n| Label list | Assignee list | Milestone list |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/0ed05e49d0209b2765fe4aa7b5e23978/Label_list.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e | \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/f6d960948f2331e3ab98ba43b250ecff/Assignee_list.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e| \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/3679e7baba1176c40e7955a49bddbab2/Milestone_list.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e |\n\n|Iteration list| Health status list | Epic list| \n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/712e9098ebf08e2d93ca1e2f88b2fc90/Iteration_list.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e |\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/00aca8037980877adf31d16fcb734f05/Health_status_list.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e|\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/764e80710788511f9780ae90db44e842/Epic_list.png\" width=\"400\"\u003e |\n\n| Mobile | \n| ------ |\n| \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/b8400c447a0b68a08d561986b14cc15b/Mobile.png\" width=\"600\"\u003e| \n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Currently piloting, details can be found in this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1392 and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a gitlab user looking at the [unit test report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html#viewing-unit-test-reports-on-gitlab), I want a clean view of data from failed tests (test file name, trace, test duration, etc.), so that I can make decisions / issues quickly and efficiently to get this pipeline passing. \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who is looking at the tests that failed in their current MR on the pipeline page because they don't use MRs.\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test) - who is reviewing failed tests from scheduled builds / an MR from a developer.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to easily view, select, and share information about failed tests within the gitlab ui.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nOne option would be to re-use the existing modal from the Test Summary to display some of this data including the trace. That modal is displayed below. It would need to be augmented with Test History and Filename.\n\nThe column name should be renamed from `Trace` to `Details` and the column contain a link/button (@v_mishra to help decide) to open the modal.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_9.52.52_AM](/uploads/acc864b3221aa96578a92dd2dcd43b55/Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_9.52.52_AM.png)\n\n### Further details\n\nSeveral new features are being or have been introduced to add functionality to the Unit Test report since it's introduction. This has improved the feature set but decreased the usability of the features unfortunately as the page gets more crowded with information. This only gets worse with [filename](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/119032) and [test history](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235525) columns being added in addition to sorting the failed tests to the top so trace data is immediately presented.\n\nCleaning up this view so a user can still see the failed tests first but having the data from those tests more easily readable is the ideal outcome for this issue.\n\nNo matter the approach the [CSS fix](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41935) implemented to cleanup the scrolling should be removed/un-cleaned up/?\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nThis is for the individual developer and part of the Core product.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-26T16:22:56.183Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T07:10:32.974Z","closed_at":"2020-10-26T18:32:56.142Z","closed_by":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","UX","UX debt","devops::verify","feature::addition","frontend","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.5","section::ops","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"}],"author":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241534","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241534","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241534/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241534/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#241534","relative":"#241534","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#241534"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70330470,"iid":241531,"project_id":278964,"title":"User unable to delete project due to whitespace problem in verification input","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n[A user on Reddit reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/igkrbu/my_project_wont_delete/) being unable to delete a project because the button to confirm deletion is never enabled after the user enters the confirmation text.

Currently piloting, details can be found in this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1392 and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a team lead reviewing a project's repository stats without code coverage setup, I do not want to see the download button for code coverage data, so i don't waste time downloading an empty file.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead) - who sees an empty graph but clicks that download button anyway.\n\nThis could impact any user on the page, the team lead is the targeted persona for the feature.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should not see a button that when clicked gives them an empty data set.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nHide the button if there is no data to present / the chart is empty.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_7.36.45_AM](/uploads/64fd71e6735e85ac2c21cd7ce715a1e6/Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_7.36.45_AM.png)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nA common complaint of the GitLab UI is having components visible that aren't actively being used but we also have to balance making features discoverable. Until a user sets up code coverage parsing they will not realize the value of this feature, but unless they see the empty graph they may not even realize that functionality is available.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Update the docs to call out download button will be active when there is data to download.\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nThe developer.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nNo.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-26T13:43:48.399Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T17:00:04.878Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T17:19:42.232Z","closed_by":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","SUS::Impacting","Technical Writing","UX","UX debt","Verify::P1","awaiting feedback","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline insights","missed:15.1","section::ops","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":11435284,"username":"Ffinnis","name":"Roman Potapov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/737599e211a25aa4c71adfaa6ce5245a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Ffinnis"}],"author":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11435284,"username":"Ffinnis","name":"Roman Potapov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/737599e211a25aa4c71adfaa6ce5245a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Ffinnis"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241502","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241502","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241502/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241502/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#241502","relative":"#241502","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#241502"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70323069,"iid":241501,"project_id":278964,"title":"Properly handle param name incoherence in multipart.rb","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n[`multipart.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/middleware/multipart.rb) receives two parts from Workhorse within an Upload requestion:\n\n- A JWT signed header in the form of `{ 'file' =\u003e 'XXXX' }`. `'file'` is the param name prefix and `'XXXX'` is the filepath when direct upload is disabled\n- A couple of request parameters.
