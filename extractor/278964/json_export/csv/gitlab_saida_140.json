[{"id":33324788,"iid":214471,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add validation to Conan recipe that conforms with Conan.io","description":"## Problem\n\nThe GitLab Conan registry does not have the same validation in the package recipe that the Conan client is checking. This can lead to problems when working with the GitLab registry.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd validation on all 4 parts of the recipe: `\u003cpkg-name\u003e/\u003cversion\u003e@\u003cuser\u003e/\u003cchannel\u003e`\n\nThe validation should match the regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_\\+\\.-]{1,50}$`\n\n## References\n\nhttps://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/attributes.html\n\n## Related problems\n\nCurrently, as of 12.10, the Conan registry is only available on the instance level, requiring the `\u003cuser\u003e` value to be the project's full `+` separated path (example `gitlab-org+gitlab`). This causes a problem in that the `user` value is limited to 50 characters but some paths are greater than 50 characters. Current behavior is that users cannot push packages with length higher than 50, so this issue will not change that behavior, but it should be addressed as soon as possible either by enabling project level access, or revisiting instance level naming restrictions.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nOne of the limitations of the copy/paste stack, is you can't upload multiple files via copy/paste. You can however, upload one at a time, but right now our design tab is blocking more uploads because they all go under the same filename.\n\nSee video:\n\n\n\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n\n\n### Further details\n\nAllowing multiple screenshots to be uploaded will allow more flexibility than just the one. \n\n### Proposal\nThe proposal is instead of naming copied and pasted designs `design.png` we add a timestamp to the end of the name, thus giving it a unique name which allows other designs to be copied/pasted. Something like the following:\n\n`design_1587503757400.png` \nor\n`design_jan_10_2019_12_56_17.png`\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n`TBD`\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n`TBD`\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

Normally when a record is updated, the `updated_at` column also changes. Unfortunately this does not happen in our codebase because we update records a bit differently, we have two cases:\n\n* Update records in bulk (Mark all as done)\n* Update individual record (Done)\n\nBoth cases are handled the same way: create an AR scope and update the `state` attribute using `update_all`.\n\nhttps://apidock.com/rails/v4.0.2/ActiveRecord/Relation/update_all\n\nIt does not instantiate the involved models and it does not trigger Active Record callbacks or validations.\n\nRelated method from Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/todo.rb#L108\n\nPassing the current time would solve this issue:\n\n```ruby\nbase.update_all(state: new_state, updated_at: Time.now)\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\n- When Todo `status` changes, the `updated_at` timestamp is also changed.\n- When Todo `status` is changed in bulk (by the \"Mark all as done\" button or \"Undo mark

Improvements\n\n* All package versions should be validated either using SemVer or whatever standard the package type is using.\n\n## Risks\n\n* This validation will occur on package creation/update.\n* There is a chance that some packages can't be pushed to the GitLab Package registry anymore.\n* Existing packages shouldn't encounter any issue.\n\n## Involved components\n\n* [`Packages::Package`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/packages/package.rb)\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n* Improve [`package_spec.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/spec/models/packages/package_spec.rb#L84) by adding examples for all package types.\n* Improve the test coverage for the component responsible for package creation/update.\n  * NPM:

snippets without access checks when `hard_delete` option is present","description":"Let's take a look at a chunk from the `Users::DestroyService`:\n\n```ruby\nMigrateToGhostUserService.new(user).execute unless options[:hard_delete]\n\nresponse = Snippets::BulkDestroyService.new(current_user, user.snippets).execute\nraise DestroyError, response.message if response.error?\n```\n\nBasically, when the option `hard_delete` is present, we don't try to migrate the associated user resources to the ghost user. This is to remove every association when the user has been reported of abuse.\n\nNevertheless, when we go to remove snippets we don't pass that option to the service. This means, that we will check the snippet access rights for the user (related https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213806). That check can fail and, therefore, the user won't be removed.\n\nInstead, what we should do is to pass the `hard_delete` option to the `Snippets::BulkDestroyService` and avoid the access right checking (we still need to remove the associated snippet repositories on disk so we still need to call this service). This way, the repository will be removed and the snippet record in the database too.\n\n/cc @dsatcher","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-15T06:06:39.351Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T07:07:02.084Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T23:58:12.776Z","closed_by":{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo Luna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4717243/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_luna"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","group::editor","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo Luna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4717243/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_luna"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4717243,"username":"a_luna","name":"Amparo Luna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4717243/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_luna"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214420","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214420","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214420/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214420/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214420","relative":"#214420","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214420"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33298089,"iid":214419,"project_id":278964,"title":"Consolidate epic tree buttons (add/create epics  and issues)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe currently have two buttons the perform 4 actions in the epic tree header.

both a `PIP_INDEX_URL` and a `pip.conf` file. This was necessary because we didn't support the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` environment variable. So the only way to install packages from a custom source was to disable the TLS verification. To disable the TLS verification we had to ask codeowners to include a `pip.conf` file with a setting to disable TLS verification.\n\nToday, we don't require TLS verification to be disabled because we support the `ADDTIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` environment variable.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n~~We might find a way to have this information in only one place.~~\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214398#note_373537559\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Update documentation to indicate that disable TLS verification is dangerous and that we recommend providing a certificate chain instead.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n# Implementation Plan\n\n* [x] Update documentation to indicate that disable TLS verification is dangerous and that we recommend providing a certificate chain instead.

milestones created at the subgroup or project level. Only milestones created at the group level are shown. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create the following structure within a group on GitLab.com that has at least a Silver subscription applied to it:\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR;\n  A[Group]--\u003eB[Subgroup];\n  B--\u003eC[Project];\n```\n\n2.

Navigate to the roadmap section of the top-level group.\n\n5. Observe that only the group level milestone appears on the roadmap.\n\n### Example Project\n\n- [Group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold) - [Milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-gold/-/milestones/7)\n  - [Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-gold/-/roadmap)\n- [Subgroup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/tristan) - [Milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-gold/tristan/-/milestones/1)\n- [Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/tristan/milestone) - [Milestone](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/tristan/milestone/-/milestones/1)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly group level milestones appears on the roadmap.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGroup level, subgroup level, and project level milestones should all display on the roadmap.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com: 12.10.0-pre `b7c8d2dbb8f`\n\nZD: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/153431 (GitLab Internal)\n\n### Design\nFigma: https://www.figma.com/file/nEx7pjtBauZY621F4G6m91/214375?node-id=0%3A1\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/0132b361fa08a89f97e5dea3f12351c1/image.png\" width=\"600\"\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-14T19:16:13.567Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T17:02:15.478Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T11:23:13.643Z","closed_by":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Enterprise Edition","UX","backend","customer","devops::plan","frontend","group::product planning","milestones","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","priority::3","reproduced on GitLab.com","roadmaps","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},{"id":3617348,"username":"uhlexsis","name":"Alexis Ginsberg","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3617348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/uhlexsis"},{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie Guibert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/705331e7e375d5832c9fa5309370b55f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fguibert"}],"author":{"id":2390023,"username":"tristan","name":"Tristan Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2390023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tristan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214375","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214375","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214375/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214375/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214375","relative":"#214375","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214375"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33282901,"iid":214369,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix External issue trackers data migration","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18639 (migration 1) we wanted to migrate data stored in the `properties` field of `services` table to data field tables (`jira_tracker_data` and `issue_tracker_data`).

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThis is the Backend-only MVC for Deploy Freeze for environments.\n\n1. Deploy freeze periods are specified using `cron` format, and managed via API. No UI is delivered in this MVC.\n\n2. If a job is being processed during a freeze period, the `CI_DEPLOY_FREEZE` CI variable is set\n\n3. Jobs which should respect the freeze period are specified with a rule, for example:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy_to_production:\n  stage: deploy\n  script: deploy_to_prod.sh\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_ENVIRONMENT_FROZEN == null\n```\n\n4. In this iteration there is no error or message, the job simply does not get created.\n\n5. The entire pipeline must be restarted if the freeze period is over and the job should now run.\n\nRelates to #24295 \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nOnly `Maintainer` users will be able to interact with the API endpoints.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-14T11:59:38.495Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T10:11:28.050Z","closed_at":"2020-05-19T14:38:39.885Z","closed_by":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie

This will allow me to limit my scan time when I have the data to show it stops finding significant issues after a certain amount of time.

This will allow any enhancements made to the **Edit Release** page to automatically be available in the Release creation workflow.\n\n#### Technical proposal\n\nBelow is a high-level technical proposal. Each bullet point represents one merge request.\n\n- Create a new Rails route for the **New Release** page. This page should be behind a `new_release_page` feature flag\n- Create a basic Vue app for this page that re-uses the existing \"detail\" Vuex store\n- Rebuild the (current) **New tag** form into the new Vue app\n- Begin reusing the **Edit Release** form on the new **New Release** page\n- Update the **New Release** button on the main **Releases** page to point to this new page (again, behind the

These Epics provide a single place for those interested in the theme to see both high level thinking about it, current progress and plans, and to make it easy others to contribute and link their ideas.\n\nI often use the add new drop-down menu to create new issues. However, Epics are missing from this list and I often have to do quite a bit of navigating to find where they may be created. ![Screen_Shot_2020-04-13_at_10.42.51_AM](/uploads/cf6beb7d73fd0c45f2899e5a6effe930/Screen_Shot_2020-04-13_at_10.42.51_AM.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd an option to create Epics from the create new drop-down.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nI do have access to create new Epics from the group detail page, but as I rarely use this page, it is inconvenient to navigate to it just to create the Epics.\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nA successful implementation would allow us to create an Epic in a few clicks from any page. \n1.

They also noticed an increase in Sidekiq jobs (probably due to the slow mirroring).\n\nAccording to them, they experienced the problem after upgrading to GitLab 12.8.8-ee.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a new repository (e.g. `LFS-repo`).\n1. Initialize LFS, and add a large file.\n1. Setup a mirror repository on the same instance (e.g. `LFS-repo-mirror`).\n1. Push another LFS object to `LFS-repo`.\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nSlow mirroring of repository (same GitLab instance) and increased number of Sidekiq jobs. Errors in `application_json.log`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nFast mirroring as the LFS already exists in the instance.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nI managed to reproduce the error in my test instance.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\nAssuming that this is supported by ZAP, I believe that we should do two things to support this feature:\n1.  Add an environment variable to disable spidering\n1.  Support multiple URLs (comma-delimited) in the `DAST_WEBSITE` environment variable.\n1.  or a text file with urls\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-10T21:12:51.050Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T04:40:08.626Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T01:39:32.507Z","closed_by":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"labels":["Category:DAST","Deliverable","backend","devops::secure","direction","documentation","group::dynamic analysis","release post item","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"}],"author":{"id":4985194,"username":"derekferguson","name":"Derek Ferguson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4985194/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/derekferguson"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214120","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214120","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214120/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214120/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214120","relative":"#214120","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214120"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3019,"epic":{"id":38258,"iid":3019,"title":"DAST: scan configuration backend improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3019","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33153104,"iid":214117,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve message when filtering on Security Dashboard lists no vulnerabilities results","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nApplying filters on the Security Dashboard that result in no displayed vulnerabilities is confusing because it shows the message \"No vulnerabilities for this project\" - \"Learn more about setting up your dashboard\".

Doing so in a project works fine, but I need this deploy token to be valid for all projects in this group. So I added a group deploy token with the same name. Unfortunately after this change the CI_DEPLOY_USER and CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD variables are undefined in the CI job.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Add a group deploy token with name 'gitlab-deploy-token'\n- Run a CI pipeline in a project within this group.\n\n### Workaround\n\n1. Created a deploy token in group level named `gitlab-deploy-token`\n1. Set group level environment variables `CI_DEPLOY_USER` and `CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD` to `gitlab-deploy-token` and the value thereof, respectively.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Either provide the values automatically\n1. or add the workaround in the documentation\n\n### Example Project\n\nExample project: https://gitlab.com/justinvtime-test/test\n\nBuild with the project deploy token defined:\nhttps://gitlab.com/justinvtime-test/test/-/jobs/505669965\n\nBuild with the group deploy token defined:\nhttps://gitlab.com/justinvtime-test/test/-/jobs/505668102\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nthe CI_DEPLOY_USER and CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD variables are undefined in the CI job\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nthe CI_DEPLOY_USER and CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD variables are defined in the CI job","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:48:24.945Z","updated_at":"2022-08-31T08:54:31.578Z","closed_at":"2022-06-15T08:41:15.776Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","Category:Pipeline Authoring","Category:Secrets Management","Release::P3","backend","candidate::15.1","configure::parked","customer","deploy keys","devops::verify","documentation","group::pipeline authoring","priority::2","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":2483990,"username":"justinvtime","name":"JustInVTime","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a89fcea53551a5289f9f0e86eee4ef2d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justinvtime"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":37,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214014","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214014","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214014/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214014/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214014","relative":"#214014","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214014"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":52751,"iid":67,"sequence":18,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":"Target milestone `15.2`","state":3,"created_at":"2022-04-03T00:05:01.966Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T00:05:02.118Z","start_date":"2022-06-13","due_date":"2022-06-26","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/52751"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":33110592,"iid":214009,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove strict naming conventions for Conan for self-managed instances","description":"### Problem to solve\nThe GitLab Conan Repository recipe must be the + separated project path, which can easily conflict with the 51 character restriction within Conan.
