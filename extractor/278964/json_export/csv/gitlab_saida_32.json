Pre-filled variables do not work correctly for branches for external custom CI config file paths","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n-

loading pre-filled variables for projects using custom CI config file paths. However, the solution does not handle branches correctly: when running a pipeline manually selecting non-default branch results in no variable being picked up. Pre-filled variables are loaded from external project using selected branch instead of using default branch name\n\n**Explaination from customer:**\n\nThis was initially reported by [Customer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001Eo9Ah). This is their explanation:\n\nWe have a problem, when we try using Predefined global variables in custom CI/CD configuration file.\nWe have special project, which contain only `.gitlab-ci.yml` files for other projects.\nFor example:\n   We have `.gitlab-ci.yml` file stored in project **group1/project1** (in this project we have only one branch, with name \"master\"). In this file we have strings:\n\n```yaml\nvariables:\n  GIT_STRATEGY: none\n \n  DEPLOY_TO_TEST:\n    value: 0\n    description: \"Change this variable to '1' if needed deploy to test\"\n\n  DEPLOY_TO_STAGE:\n    value: 0\n    description: \"Change this variable to '1' if needed deploy to stage\"\n\n  SKIP_TEST:\n    value: 0\n    description: \"Skip maven tests\"\n```\n\nIn project **group1/project2**, menu \"Settings\" - \"CI/CD\" - \"General pipelines\" - string \"CI/CD configuration file\", we specify: `.gitlab-ci.yml@group1/project1`\n\nAfter that we try run new pipeline manually, in menu \"CI/CD\" - \"Pipelines\" - press button \"Run pipeline\".\nIf we specify branch master in field \"Run for branch name or tag\", predefined variables specified in `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in project group1/project1 displayed in web page. If we specify another branch in field \"Run for branch name or tag\" (for example branch \"develop\"), predefined variables not displayed in web page.\n\nWe create new branch \"develop\" in project **group1/project1**, and after few moments later (we don't know how long it took) we choose \"develop\" branch, when try run pipeline manually in project group1/project2, and predefined variables display in web page.\n\nI think this is wrong behavior. Maybe we're missing something when using custom CI/CD configuration file?\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create project X\n1. In project X create a `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n1. In the above file, add pre-defined variables\n1. Try to run manual pipeline on project X\n1. Pre-filled variables are shown in UI as expected\n1. Create project Y\n1. Use settings of project Y to point its CI config path to project X: `.gitlab-ci.yml@X`\n1. Try to run a manual pipeline on project Y\n1. Pre-filled variables are shown in UI as expected\n1. Create branch `develop` in Project X\n1. Try to run a manual pipeline on project Y, branch `develop`\n1. Pre-filled variables are not shown on the UI\n\n### Example project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/dzalbo-group/sandbox/external-pipeline-config/application (happy to give access on request)\n\n### Considered workaround\n\nI have considered a workaround of setting Custom CI/CD configuration file on Project Y to `.gitlab-ci.yml@X:main` (adding a reference name), but in this case pre-filled variables don't load at all. This also looks like undesirable behaviour as [our documentation clearly allows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#custom-cicd-configuration-file-examples) `my/path/.my-custom-file.yml@mygroup/another-project:refname` format\n\nThe only way to load pre-filled variables on non-default branch is to create a branch on Project X with the same name, but that's not a real workaround\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPre-filled variables defined in custom CI config path outside of repository does not render when selecting a branch\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPre-filled variables defined in custom CI config path outside of repository render in run pipeline form independently of selected branch","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-22T10:53:46.359Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T14:16:24.288Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T20:37:25.467Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["CI variables","Category:Pipeline Authoring","approaching-SLO","backend","customer","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","missed-SLO","priority::3","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":5208632,"username":"kdemircan","name":"Kaan Demircan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5208632/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kdemircan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353456","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353456","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353456/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353456/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#353456","relative":"#353456","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#353456"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5764,"epic":{"id":250141,"iid":5764,"title":"Bugs: Variables","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5764","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":{"id":74860,"iid":115,"sequence":28,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-08-08T00:05:02.221Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T00:05:02.449Z","start_date":"2022-10-31","due_date":"2022-11-13","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/74860"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":102853056,"iid":353455,"project_id":278964,"title":"[SaaS] Exclude guests from overage calculation checks","description":"When calculating overage on adding a user or a group to an existing group using Ultimate subscription, we should exclude guests from the calculation.\n\nProposal:\nFor the existing [check_overage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/122528344eba2ab72d97ccf1635a6bc771ec9885/ee/app/assets/javascripts/invite_members/check_overage.js) pass a role (`Guest/Developer/Reporter etc`) of the group to be added and the plan type.

dictalchemy","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nHi,\n\nwe recently found out that the dependency scanning (Gemnasium) job started failing for a projects where we use `Python v3.9` image and `dictalchemy==0.1.2.7` package.\n\nThis is because right now the `gemnasium:2-python-3.9` Docker image comes with setuptools 58.1.0, and this version of setuptools doesn't provide 2to3 anymore.

This issue fixes the reported XSS but leaves the HTML injection that was also mentioned. I don't know how you deal with these situations, but I thought I report this, and you can decide :)\n\nThe issue linked above shows how a user can inject HTML in any Note (actually any Markdown it seems. For example wiki pages and issue descriptions) by abusing [syntax_highlight_filter.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c2e5d7b89b84cc5b44575592bb706ef75c3d1bbb/lib/banzai/filter/syntax_highlight_filter.rb).\n\nThere are more ways to take this injection and weaponize it than the patched Emoji tag. I have a list of additional vectors but though that I would report the worst one (proper full stored XSS) and explain more if you decide to accept the report. To not waste our time.\n\nI have multiple ways to inject `script` tags, but it looks like you have hardened your CSP? None of the old bypasses worked for me. But it still seems that you have not blocked the `base` tag. And fortunately for me, the injection let me pass in `base` tags. So by entering this into an issue description or wiki page\n\n```  \n\u003cpre data-sourcepos=\"\u0026#34;%22 href=\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e  \n\u003cbase href=https://joaxcar.com\u003e  \n\u003cpre x=\u0026#34;\"\u003e  \n\u003ccode\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e  \n```  \nAll relative links in the page will try to load their data from my site \"joaxar.com\".

In the case of an issue page, we have this script  \n```  \nhttp://joaxcar.com/assets/webpack/hello.4948f350.chunk.js  \n```  \nand for a wiki page we have  \n```  \nhttps://joaxcar.com/assets/webpack/top_nav.c9763726.chunk.js  \n```  \n![after.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c911617f-d58d-4f14-8bf9-163c916887f5/after.png)\n\nNow I just have to create these files on my domain, and they will load and bypass CSP (as these script tags will have nonce in place and can thus load anything)\n\n![payload.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4e02554e-e32c-4af6-b89c-1df90f831358/payload.jpg)\n\n####  Steps to reproduce  \n1. log in as a user on Gitlab.com  \n2. go to any project (or create one), and add a new issue  \n3. enter this as the description (replace with your own server if you need to generate new scripts on your own domain)  \n```  \n\u003cpre data-sourcepos=\"\u0026#34;%22 href=\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e  \n\u003cbase href=https://joaxcar.com\u003e  \n\u003cpre x=\u0026#34;\"\u003e  \n\u003ccode\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e  \n```  \n4. save the issue  \n5. open DevTools (f12) and look for failing script imports  \n6. create the missing script on your domain containing  \n```  \nalert(document.domain)  \n```  \n7. reload the page and the popup should pop\n\n![xssbase.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1d88bdd8-a729-43e2-9c2f-0a669ca32de1/xssbase.jpg)\n\n\n#####  Impact\n\nStored XSS in gitlab.com\n\nThere are more that can be added to the report but I am sending this in first and will add information later. The XSS can as you know create tokens (and as I have shown before take over SSO accounts)\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nHTML injection in Markdown\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nShould not be possible\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nStored XSS in gitlab.com\n\nThere are more that can be added to the report but I am sending this in first and will add information later.

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Configure the following group/project structure, where `UserA` is added as a `Maintainer` of `Parent_Group` and `UserB` is added directly to `Deploy_Group` as a `Maintainer` as well.\n\n```\nParent_Group:\n  - Deploy_Group\n  - Project\n```\n1. Add `Deploy_Group` as a group allowed to deploy into `Project' protected environment.\n1. As `UserB`, try to deploy to the protected environment on `Project`. This operation succeeds.\n1. As `UserA`, try to deploy to the same protected environment. This operation fails because `UserA` doesn't have the necessary privileges for deployment.\n\n`UserA` should be able to deploy because by being a `Maintainer` on `Parent_Group`, they receive `Maintainer` privileges on `Deploy_Group` as well via inheritance, but inheritance is currently not taken into account for protected environments.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Add an option to [Protected Environment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html) to change the group-base access check behavior.\n- There are two types for group-base access:\n  - `direct` ...

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353244) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `container_registry_follow_redirects_middleware`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `container_registry_follow_redirects_middleware` feature flag.

It is about moving other methods from `EE::IssueLink` to `EE::IssuableLink`. For example, `refresh_blocking_issue_cache` which caches blocking issues, I believe we will have the same performance issue for epic links when sorting epics by count of blocking epics. Maybe we can keep this out of the MVC, but would be nice to have it on an issue so we can remember to get it scheduled.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-18T15:44:41.088Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T18:20:48.218Z","closed_at":"2022-03-02T18:20:48.193Z","closed_by":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"labels":["backend","devops::plan","epics","group::product planning","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"}],"author":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353234","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353234","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353234/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353234/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#353234","relative":"#353234","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#353234"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7546,"epic":{"id":439603,"iid":7546,"title":"Add support for epic to epic linking - MVC 1","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7546","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102691635,"iid":353228,"project_id":278964,"title":"Backend: Retry a failed job in single-stage pipeline causes remaining skipped jobs","description":"### Summary\n\nAfter introducing single-stage pipelines (#30632), we can create pipelines without any stage and connect jobs by `needs`.

The pytest output will show each failing test with the failure output. This can then be used to look at the individual test artifacts that are part of the job.\n\n#### Populating the Test tab of Pipeline output\n\nPytest can generate junit xml reports which can then be picked up by GitLab using the `report` keyword in the ci/cd configuration. This provides another way to view which tests failed. It's unlikely this output will be enough to resolve a test failure on it's own. However, it does provide the test names allowing local reproduction and also indicating which artifacts can be viewed to further investigate the issue.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. [x] Send docker logs to /dev/null. They are not useful.\n1. [x] Display the pytest log to console at end of test regardless of success or failure.\n1. [x] Display a notice on how to use the worker-entry job.\n   1. Review pytest log output to get test failure name\n   1. Use test failure name to see specific log files for that test.\n1. [x] Have pytest generate a junitxml report that is captured via the `report` keyword. This will populate the `Test` tab of the pipeline.\n   1.

Users will see warnings in their pipelines Security tab\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n1. New pipelines will not create vulnerabilities if the report doesn't pass the validation, since the artifacts remain for some time there should be no data loss if we quickly disable the feature flag\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set show_report_validation_warnings true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set show_report_validation_warnings true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab show_report_validation_warnings true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss show_report_validation_warnings true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com show_report_validation_warnings true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org show_report_validation_warnings true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com show_report_validation_warnings true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e show_report_validation_warnings true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set show_report_validation_warnings \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set show_report_validation_warnings \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set show_report_validation_warnings true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `show_report_validation_warnings`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `show_report_validation_warnings` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete show_report_validation_warnings --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete show_report_validation_warnings --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete show_report_validation_warnings`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set show_report_validation_warnings false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-17T15:48:37.514Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T14:11:25.709Z","closed_at":"2022-03-11T15:49:22.946Z","closed_by":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},"labels":["feature flag","feature::addition","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"}],"author":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał Zając","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/487608/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Quintasan"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353125","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":53,"completed_count":25},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"25 of 53 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353125","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353125/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353125/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#353125","relative":"#353125","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#353125"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6968,"epic":{"id":374803,"iid":6968,"title":"Enforce validation of security reports","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6968","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":102627761,"iid":353117,"project_id":278964,"title":"ChatOps Feature command doesn't work with Namespace objects","description":"## Problem\n\nThe ChatOps command to set a feature flag for a specific actor [doesn't work](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1643624950207339) (internal link) if the target is the full path of a user namespace.

`api_kaminari_count_with_limit` feature flag, after the feature flag has been enabled by default for an appropriate amount of time in production.\n\nThe feature flag is enabled globally as we can see running: `/chatops run feature get api_kaminari_count_with_limit`.\n\nThis is an old feature flag, introduced in 11.8 with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/23931 and the last time someone looked at was https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43428.\n\n- [x] Default enabled. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82003 (%\"14.9\")\n- [x] Cleanup

teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n\u003c!-- Any MRs that need to be rolled back? Communication that needs to happen?

I want to legally own all of the IP that exists under this account.\n\nIn order to achieve this, we need to have a manual process where a human can verify that the domain verification is legit. If it is, the `provisioned_by_group_id` can be set, making the user an Enterprise User.\n\n## Background\n\nExisting solution for this is in the `provisioned_by_group_id` flag. This gets set when users are provisioned via SCIM.\n\n## MVC Definition\n##### [✏️ Figma work file](https://www.figma.com/file/noMqTrsYki1tVuYcbPA9xK/%23353030-Domain-verification?node-id=0%3A1)\n\n##### 🧙‍♀️ Wizard text\n---\n\n### Get started with GitLab Pages\n\nGitLab Pages lets you deploy a static website in minutes.

Domain verification already exists in GitLab Pages. Let's take advantage of these domains that are already verified.\n2. Any domain that is verified via Pages is considered verified for the purpose of turning users into Enterprise users.\n3. This feature lives behind a feature flag\n4. Group owner navigates to Group Settings and sees a list of all domains verified with Pages\n5. Presence of a button with \"Claim Users\"\n6. A warning message appears when user clicks \"Claim Users\".\n    - This will claim any users that have a primary email address matching the domains X, Y, and Z (exact text TBD). This change is not reversible, are you sure you want to proceed?\n7. User clicks yes, window disappears and progress bar is displayed \"XX of YY users claimed\" status until the process is complete\n8. List of users claimed (username, email address). This list is historically visable.\n9. User clicks no, exit out of process\n10. This button updates `provisioned_by_group_id` to match the group ID of the verified domain\n11. Open Question: Should we create another field behind the scenes to mark this as a \"claimed user\" via this process? Would be helpful to know who was provisioned vs who was claimed.\n\n### Legal Question:\n\n1. Q: Can we automatically take an account and, as long as it has an `___@enterprise-name.com` email address, have it be claimed by the organization without notifying the user? The thought was that due to the MVC, the organization would notify its users of the claim process if they wanted to.\n\nA: This is technically included in our EULA and would be allowed, but we need to consider customer experience.\n\n### User Experience\n\n- There is concern that having your account suddenly claimed by your company with no warning is not a good user experience. Do we need to provide some kind of notification to users before they are claimed?\n- I have done some customer discovery around this and they are not empathetic to these concerns, they believe that their users should realize if they are using their work e-mail as a primary account e-mail address, it is owned by the company\n\n### Tier\n\n~\"GitLab Premium\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n\n\nFeature flag?\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-16T22:54:25.382Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T23:10:27.182Z","closed_at":"2022-09-14T15:46:19.062Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","GitLab.com Priority","auto updated","backend","devops::manage","direction","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","missed:15.3","priority::4","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","severity::4","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},{"id":4584545,"username":"dmoraBerlin","name":"Daniel Mora","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0604ecfb7035e409af09d4a3b6d7dcb2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmoraBerlin"}],"author":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"user_notes_count":78,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353030","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353030","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353030/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353030/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#353030","relative":"#353030","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#353030"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5299,"epic":{"id":191439,"iid":5299,"title":"Group domain verification","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5299","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102577072,"iid":353029,"project_id":278964,"title":"Global Search - New Header Search doesn't support Non-JS searches","description":"## What/Why\n\nWith the new Header Search we no longer support non-js related searches.

I have a working example of how we can do this on this MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79993/diffs#62e8e643749bb96169a0239af18fe980e0a8cc04\n\n**BONUS POINTS:** If the JS mounts while the user is in the middle of typing it wipes away their search.  We should add some logic at the mount point and preserve the search.  We already sort of do this by \"re-focusing\" the input when it mounts so we can expand on that.\n\ncc/ @nickbrandt @changzhengliu @JohnMcGuire @tbulva","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-16T22:48:24.203Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:59:11.613Z","closed_at":"2022-03-14T09:27:50.958Z","closed_by":{"id":10776513,"username":"tbulva","name":"Tomas Bulva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10776513/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tbulva"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","devops::data_stores","feature flag","feature::enhancement","found:gitlab.com","frontend","global nav","group::global search","section::enablement","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},{"id":10776513,"username":"tbulva","name":"Tomas Bulva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10776513/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tbulva"}],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353029","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353029","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353029/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/353029/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#353029","relative":"#353029","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#353029"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102576522,"iid":353027,"project_id":278964,"title":"Package Manager PyPI instructions should link to personal token instructions","description":"I have a project whose CI/CD pipeline builds Python wheels and uploads them to the Package Registry every night.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Additional context https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348332#note_840063606.\n1. [ ] Add a migration plan to set the value of `delayed_group_deletion` to `deletion_adjourned_period \u003e 0`.\n1.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73855, we increased the dotenv variable limit from `20` to:\n\n* 50 for FREE\n* 100 for Premium\n* 150 for Ultimate\n\nHowever, this only applies to new users or groups that are on the new pricing model of free, premium or ultimate. \n\nExisting users or groups that are on silver or gold plan still get a limit of `20`.\n\nFor example:\n\n@sliaquat is on Gold plan and is unable to add more that 20 variables: https://gitlab.com/sliaquat/test-dot-env-var-limits-1/-/jobs/2098591896\n\n@sanadhussain.backup is a newly created user on Free plan is able to add more than 20 variables: https://gitlab.com/sanadhussain.backup/test-dot-env-var-limits-new-user/-/jobs/2098603257\n\nThis also happens to old/existing groups that are on Ultimate such as the `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa` group:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/-/jobs/2096216743\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Use an existing user that is on an old pricing tier model other than Free, such as silver or gold. \n1. Try to create a pipeline that saves more than 20 variables in dotenv file such as this: https://gitlab.com/sliaquat/test-dot-env-var-limits-1/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml\n1. Run the pipeline\n\n### Example Project\n\n* New user on Free plan: https://gitlab.com/sanadhussain.backup/test-dot-env-var-limits-new-user\n* Existing user on Gold plan: https://gitlab.com/sliaquat/test-dot-env-var-limits-1\n* Existing group on Ultimate: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nExisting users on old pricing model/tier do not get the updated dotenv variable limit set in application limits  \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nExisting users on old pricing model/tier should get the updated dotenv variable limit set in application limits  \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-16T05:53:59.459Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T13:00:42.708Z","closed_at":"2022-04-24T08:47:01.826Z","closed_by":{"id":4509877,"username":"dhershkovitch","name":"Dov Hershkovitch","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7daa3113f0359f08a217fa800d9cc1d2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dhershkovitch"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","approaching-SLO","backend","candidate::15.1","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This UX issue is intended to solve for the design needs of those error messages. \n\n## Problems \n\n1) The current invite modal can't handle multiple error messages at once. Single or multiple emails added may trigger multiple errors and we need to clearly communicate what infractions are causing each error for each email. \n2) The current error message to inform the inviter that the member has already been added needs improvement. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334280#note_706373370 for context\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe need to find a way to enable the invite modal to manage and display multiple errors at once.\n\nNeeds to include:\n- Multiple error handling - clear communication of what problems each email added is causing\n- Improved error messaging for emails that have already been invited (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334280#note_842074541)\n\n## Design\n\n- Add in an alert that explains what went wrong with the errored emails, as well as change the colours of the user pills to show which succeeded and which did not. \n- This alert supersedes all other alerts.\n\n| Error Message | Error Message Expanded |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2022-04-13_at_2.06.56_PM](/uploads/455b23e7b217c24548c84dfa4d4b49f4/Screen_Shot_2022-04-13_at_2.06.56_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2022-04-13_at_2.07.07_PM](/uploads/1b2bab183679d4addb84e233c83b1fd6/Screen_Shot_2022-04-13_at_2.07.07_PM.png) |\n\n#### [Design File](https://www.figma.com/file/9i4TvqFygXOBJf8QGOBaoN/UX%3A-Enable-Invite-modal-to-handle-multiple-errors-at-once?node-id=14%3A14729)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-16T03:07:07.177Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T13:40:02.665Z","closed_at":"2022-04-20T22:54:16.132Z","closed_by":{"id":9347704,"username":"gdoud","name":"Gayle Doud","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9347704/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gdoud"},"labels":["Technical Writing","UX","auto updated","devops::growth","group::acquisition","section::growth","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":9347704,"username":"gdoud","name":"Gayle Doud","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9347704/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gdoud"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":51,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352917","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352917","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352917/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352917/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352917","relative":"#352917","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352917"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3502,"epic":{"id":62876,"iid":3502,"title":"Move the \"invite members\" form into a modal","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3502","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102512057,"iid":352913,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add CAPTCHA support to REST API","description":"## Summary\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.\n--\u003e\n\nThis issue represents the work to support solving CAPTCHAS via the REST API, as we already support it via the GraphQL API.\n\nThis is important to enable third-party tools to integrate with GitLab installations which have CAPTCHA enabled.\n\nSee [Consistently support CAPTCHA via GraphQL and REST API](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5527#consistently-support-captcha-via-graphql-and-rest-api) for details.\n\n## Improvements\n\nCAPTCHAs can now be solved via the REST API, allowing third-party integrations which use the REST API to support CAPTCHA for GitLab installations which have CAPTCHA enabled (including gitlab.com SaaS)\n\n## Risks\n\nThere is some risk because the API is being changed, but existing and new test coverage should mitigate that risk.\n\n## Involved components\n\nThe following REST API endpoints:\n\n1.

Discovery for Custom Permissions MVC","description":"## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to try to eliminate unknowns about technical constraints that may exist when we go to tackle our MVC for customizable roles and permissions.\n\n## MVC Definition\n\nThe MVC has 2 parts:\n\n1. Existing Permissions table is currently static. This will be updated to be dynamically generated by code, leaving the code as the SSOT for Permissions.\n\n2. Users can create a *new* role that uses `Guest` as a template. The only customizable permission is `download source code`(enabled or not). Ideally, this would be `view source code` only, but we are reliant on ~\"group::source code\" splitting view and download into 2 permissions first. Depending on LoE, we can make this API only to start with.\n\n#### Designs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350192\n\n## Deliverable For This Issue\n\n- Technical task breakdown, complete with weight, to complete the MVC above.\n- Any areas where we could compromise on the MVC definition to deliver more quickly\n- Any areas we absolutely cannot/should not compromise \n- Technical constraints - an understanding of if entire underlying permissions architecture will need to be changed, and timeline for how this wilneed to be done (ex: will all architecture need to be done before we can start delivering user value?","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-15T19:07:49.541Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T11:46:43.473Z","closed_at":"2022-06-29T22:34:18.982Z","closed_by":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"labels":["Category:Permissions","Deliverable","auto updated","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"}],"author":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352891","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352891","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352891/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352891/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352891","relative":"#352891","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352891"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4035,"epic":{"id":85932,"iid":4035,"title":"Customizable Roles and Permissions","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4035","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102489673,"iid":352875,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add metric availability to instrumentation classes","description":"Related [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77629#note_842842031)\n\nWe could have cases where we have a condition to add or not a metric to Service Ping.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79232#note_842650443.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Remove the CSS variable  `--black-normal`.\n1. Use an existing color for black-normal by redefining the SCSS variable as `$black-normal: var(--gl-text-color);`.\n1. Update the startup CSS.\n\n### How to validate the changes\n\nTo validate in Value Stream analytics do the following:\n\n1. Create a branch with your changes that removes this variable.\n1. Seed data `VSA_SEED_PROJECT_ID=2 VSA_ISSUE_COUNT=10 SEED_VSA=true FILTER=cycle_analytics rake db:seed_fu`\n1. View the dashboard at `[GDK_HOST]/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/-/value_stream_analytics`\n1. Checkout `master` branch and validate that there is no visual changes in the dashboard.\n\n**Note:** If you're not testing on `gitlab-org/gitlab-shell` then you need to replace the `VSA_SEED_PROJECT_ID` in the first step.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-15T10:22:15.693Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T07:50:39.777Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T07:50:39.759Z","closed_by":{"id":832471,"username":"psimyn","name":"Simon Knox","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3de75939c39eecd6ea2215ec740a8037?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/psimyn"},"labels":["CSS cleanup","frontend","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":536474,"username":"parkourkarthik","name":"Karthik (PK)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/536474/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/parkourkarthik"}],"author":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":536474,"username":"parkourkarthik","name":"Karthik (PK)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/536474/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/parkourkarthik"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352835","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352835","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352835/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352835/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352835","relative":"#352835","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352835"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102468111,"iid":352833,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add internal API endpoints to list, create and delete related epic","description":"Related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351597.\n\nWe need internal endpoints to manage related epics, similar to existing ones for related issues.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set integration_form_sections \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set integration_form_sections \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set integration_form_sections true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `integration_form_sections`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `integration_form_sections` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete integration_form_sections --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete integration_form_sections --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete integration_form_sections`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set integration_form_sections false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-15T08:46:21.692Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:00:31.317Z","closed_at":"2022-04-03T14:55:00.559Z","closed_by":{"id":4704683,"username":"justin_ho","name":"Justin Ho Tuan Duong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4704683/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justin_ho"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","devops::manage","feature flag","feature::addition","group::integrations","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":4704683,"username":"justin_ho","name":"Justin Ho Tuan Duong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4704683/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justin_ho"}],"author":{"id":4704683,"username":"justin_ho","name":"Justin Ho Tuan Duong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4704683/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justin_ho"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4704683,"username":"justin_ho","name":"Justin Ho Tuan Duong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4704683/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justin_ho"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352827","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":12},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"12 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352827","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352827/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352827/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352827","relative":"#352827","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352827"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102447347,"iid":352805,"project_id":278964,"title":"Clean up unused `affix` styles","description":"From a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/80612#note_842689585): \n\nwe can probably delete our CSS rules for `.affix`, since it looks like we only add `js-tabs-affix` class now.\n\nCheck when/if `affix` classes were removed from HAML/JS, confirm the rules are not needed.

In order to expand our support for GraphQL, we need to be able to support defining GraphQL endpoints through a GraphQL schema. We should support defining the endpoints via the GraphQL SDL, by allowing them to provide the path to a schema file.\n\n### Proposal\n\nOpen Questions:\n- Can we implement this w/o some form of parameter dependency resolution.\n- Should we create multiple exchanges per item? For example if their are optional inputs.\n\nThe GraphQL endpoint can also provide the full schema. This schema defines all of the things API Security will want to test, both for DAST and API Fuzzing. The proposed method of supporting the GraphQL schema for automatic testing is the following:\n\n1. Add a new variable `_GRAPHQL`, allowing the user to provide a GraphQL endpoint address or schema file\n1. Refactor the IReader readers to produce Operation+Request instead of just Request.\n1. Create a new IReader for GraphQL that provides each query/mutation as an `Operation`\n\n#### Refactor Readers to produce Operations and Request pairs\n\nThe current reader implementation produces `Request` instances which are then converted into `Operation` instances by the `RunnerService`. Unfortunately that causes information loss for API specifications that include information about the parameters such as type or constraints.\n\nThis work will be required prior to creating the `GraphQlSchemaReader`.\n\nProposed new `IReader` interface:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace Peach.Web.Runner.Interfaces\n{\n    public interface IReader\n    {\n        IEnumerable\u003c(Operation Operation, Request Request)\u003e GetOperations(IRunnerOptions runnerOptions);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nQuestions:\n1. For existing readers, do they use `WebApiService.OperationFromRequest` to create the Operation to pair with the Request they are already returning?\n\n#### GraphQlSChemaReader (Peach.Web.Runner.Services.Readers)\n\nImplement a new reader that creates a series of exchanges that provide coverage of all parameterized queries and mutations.\n\n1. Use our existing GraphQL.NET dependency to parse schema\n   1. When schema is provided as a file, read file parse schema\n   1. When schema is provided as a url:\n      1. Get schema by running the query provided below\n         1. Make sure to use overrides when making this request so it's authenticated\n         1. The example query assumes max 10 levels of nested types. What do we do if the target schema is deeper? Should we pick a limit and say anything beyond that is not supported? Can we detect if there are more types that we didn't receive and issue a new query to get them?\n      1. Extract schema from query result\n1. Iterate over the `Queries` and `Mutations` section of the `Schema` instance, generating (Operation, Request) pairs\n   1. Generate an `Operation` with a `GraphQLBody`\n      1. Option: Create a GraphQL AST doc directly, or create a GraphQL query and parse it.\n         1. We have some concern that building the AST may be complex or fiddly, but initial investigation suggests it won't be too bad. It would be nice to have a library that was specifically designed to dynamically build GraphQL queries, but the only ones we can find assume that there is a statically-typed model.\n         1. If we end up parsing a request, we need to ensure that we still end up with the correct type information\n   1. Convert the `Operation` into a `Request`\n      1. Is `WebApiService.OperationIntoRequest` sufficient for this?\n\n##### Interpreting the schema response\n\n- Interesting part is `data`, `__schema`, `types` object\n  - Query root name is `__schema`[`queryType`][`name`]\n  - Mutation root name is `__schema`[`mutationType`][`name`]\n  - Queries are listed as `types`[query root][`fields`]\n  - Mutations as `types`[mutation root][`fields`]\n- So far unable to find a way to read json response into the `Schema` instance\n  - might need to construct by hand\n\n#### Testing\n\n[API Security GraphQL Target](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/api-fuzzing-e2e/image-target-graphql)  \n\n#### Implementation Checklist\n\n1.
