In this report, i found out that drafted review in merge request change can still be published when the projects get archived. According to GitLab docs, archived project is in read-only state. Comment, notes and changes cannot be performed in any of the content of the project. But, in this issue, drafted review still can be published after project is archived.\n\n### Proof of Concept  \n1.) User A have a project , example :[REDACTED] \n2.) User B and then make a draft review on one of the merge request in[REDACTED]\n3.) User A then archived the project in settings  \n4.) User B still able to submit and publish the drafted review that he previously make, that allow User B to comment to part of merge request, which is forbidden when project is archived\n\n\u003c\u003ePoC Video Attached  \n[REDACTED]\n\n## Impact\n\nUser still able to comment to merge reqeuest through darft review in changes even if merge request is in read-only state (archived) which souldn't be able to modified by normal user.\n\nBest Regards,  \n[@]rafiem\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise

Summary\n\nHello,\n\nI reported this #640962 but it was duplicate and i see that original has been marked as resolved. But there still few cases which discloses some info to unauthorised users\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a Public group  \n2. Create private project underneath  \n3. Create a issue inside private project  \n4. create 2 EPICs in public groups  \n5.  In issue, apply the EPIC1 to the issue . This should be done using issue i.e apply EPIC to issue and not the other way.  \n6. Now change the EPIC from EPIC1 to EPIC 2 with in issue itself.   \n7. Now if you check go to EPIC and see the timeline, you will see something like this\n\n![Screenshot_2019-10-15_at_14.20.17.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7f1ccc64-5deb-4445-936f-c1adf59b3a5d/Screenshot_2019-10-15_at_14.20.17.png)\n\n8. If any non member see the EPIC, they wont see this info in UI as they are not the members.  \n9 But using below graphiQL query, they can see this info which reveals the private project name\n\n Go to `https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer`  \n```  \nquery ($group_path: ID!) {  \n  group(fullPath: $group_path) {  \n epic(iid:\"1\"){notes{edges{node{body}}}}  \n}\n}  \n```\n\nQuery Variables  \n```  \n{\"group_path\": \"newgroup_1\"}  \n```\n\nThe response would be like   \n```  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"group\": {  \n      \"epic\": {  \n        \"notes\": {  \n          \"edges\": [  \n            {  \n              \"node\": {  \n                \"body\": \"moved issue privateproject_1#2 to epic \u00262\"  \n              }  \n            }  \n          ]  \n        }  \n      }  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Examples  \nYou can use my above example. I have set the group as public and you wont see any private projects i it because you are not a member. However, using graphql, you will notice above response which i posted which reveals the private project name to you\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDiscloses private project name to unauthorised users\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAuthorised users should see the private project related info\n\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too.\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nDiscloses private project names to unauthorised users using GraphQL\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_2019-10-15_at_14.20.17.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7f1ccc64-5deb-4445-936f-c1adf59b3a5d/Screenshot_2019-10-15_at_14.20.17.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-21T14:43:34.196Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:55:45.402Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T21:55:26.047Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","epics","group::product planning","priority::4","security","severity::4","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34556","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34556","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34556/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34556/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34556","relative":"#34556","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34556"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26161876,"iid":34554,"project_id":278964,"title":"Can't create a release based on a Git tag that includes special characters","description":"### Summary\n\nGit allows the creation of some pretty crazy tag names.  For example, all of the following are valid tag names:\n\n1. `a/b`\n1. `A/B`\n1. `a/b/c/d`\n1. `a/b.c`\n1. `0/1/2`\n1. `` !/\"#%\u0026'{}+,-.\u003c\u003e;=@]_`{|} ``\n1. `🙂🚀😂🇺🇸💩🇨🇦💯👍🤦`\n1. `(╯°□°)╯︵┻━┻`\n1. `¯|_(ツ)_/¯`\n\nOur **Tags** page handles all of these edges cases properly, but if I attempt to create a release based on any of these tags (by adding content to the **Release notes** field when creating a tag), the page times out and the release isn't created (although the tag _does_ get created).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to a project's **Tags** page.\n1. Click \"New tag\"\n1. Enter `` 🙂!/\"#%\u0026'{}+,-.\u003c\u003e;=@]_`{|}🚀 `` as the Tag's name\n1. Add a tag message and release notes.\n1. Click \"Create tag\"\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe page times out after clicking \"Create tag\".\n\nAfter navigating back to the **Tags** page, a new tag with the name `` 🙂!/\"#%\u0026'{}+,-.\u003c\u003e;=@]_`{|}🚀 `` will have been created, but no associated release will have been created (i.e. the will have no release notes, and no new release will be added to the **Releases** page).\n\nAdditionally, clicking the \"Edit\" button next to the tag on the **Tags** page will result in a 404.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe page should not time out after clicking \"Create tag\".\n\nA release should be associated with the new tag. (I.e. the tag should have release notes and a new entry should be added to the **Releases** page.)\n\nClicking the tag's \"Edit\" button should not result in a 404.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nHere is a screenshot of a tag I created with release notes.

They also have the ability to upload new image versions as long as they had the necessary permission level to the project\n\n\n### PoC Setup\n\n***Local Gitlab-ce install, version:  12.3.5-ee (9dbaa740018)***  \n \nUser called **testuser1** who will be blocked but already has developer access to **testuser2_new** project\n\nUser called **testuser2** with a project called **testuser2_new** which is set to internal, this project contains a container image based on Alpine Linux\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe first step is to make sure the blocked user **testuser1** has a personal access token with the necessary access before they are disabled\n\nNext, as the admin, block **testuser**.   As can be seen below, they can no longer use their personal access token for access or login to the GUI\n\n![image1-blocked.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/860e8278-e2be-4ece-9945-4fb9ccbaf9b4/image1-blocked.PNG)\n\n![image2-blocked.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ee7df387-adaa-43ad-822a-761fd8bba5ce/image2-blocked.PNG)\n\n\nAs **testuser2** create a Dockerfile in a directory similar to the below and upload it using the Docker CLI to the GitLab container registry, the docker file is listed below and the commands to upload:\n\n```  \nFROM alpine:latest  \nCMD tail -f /dev/null  \n```\n\n```bash  \nDocker build -t docker.local.com/testuser2/testuser2_new .  \nDocker push docker.local.com/testuser2/testuser2_new  \n```\n\n**Note.** docker.local.com is a /etc/hosts entry for the local GitLab server\n\n![image4-registry.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/9f0329b8-2576-40bf-80ac-165c620ab248/image4-registry.PNG)\n\n\nNext, as **testuser1**, login with the Docker client to the GitLab container registry using the personal access token created earlier.

It is also an issue that a blocked user still has the ability to upload new images to projects if they previously had the necessary level of access.  The access should be revoked same as to what happens with personal access token usage with the API and GUI access.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [image3-login.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/6849ea86-34f1-4818-a0c9-2c1a5b88c0b5/image3-login.PNG)\n* [image2-blocked.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ee7df387-adaa-43ad-822a-761fd8bba5ce/image2-blocked.PNG)\n* [image4-registry.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/9f0329b8-2576-40bf-80ac-165c620ab248/image4-registry.PNG)\n* [image5-images.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/727fa863-3a74-4308-a5ca-2aefdf3d3da5/image5-images.PNG)\n* [image6-dockerbuild.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7ef6ef60-a587-456d-91d2-2de39f90f22e/image6-dockerbuild.PNG)\n* [image7-updateregistry.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ba66e4b6-7cd6-407d-a0d4-8f1a55aac066/image7-updateregistry.PNG)\n* [image1-blocked.PNG](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/860e8278-e2be-4ece-9945-4fb9ccbaf9b4/image1-blocked.PNG)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-21T13:46:39.433Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T07:04:30.332Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T16:16:53.988Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","HackerOne","Package:P2","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","priority::3","ruby","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-12-27","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34550","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34550","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34550/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34550/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34550","relative":"#34550","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34550"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26160429,"iid":34548,"project_id":278964,"title":"Approval rules with users that have their access revoked could become impossible to satisfy","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen creating an ApprovalRule (`ApprovalProjectRule` or `ApprovalMergeRequestRule`) and removing access from the users/groups who are supposed to approve for that rule, it becomes impossible to satisfy the rule.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Right now, it will loop on those 1000 elements and erase them one by one.\n\nWe could break this loop into smaller jobs. For example, we could loop *and* enqueue jobs for deleting one or *n* tags. This way, the work is decomposed in smaller unit of tasks and depending on the amount of workers attached to the queue, they could be executed in parallel and thus the processing time of all these tags (at the cost of increased queue's load).\n\n## Risks\n\n* We can spike the number jobs to an unreasonable amount. Let's say we have 100'000 tags and we enqueue 1 job per tag which will give 100'000 jobs at once.\n  * We should adapt the way the tags are chunked. For example, instead of splitting 1 job per tag we could split the work in a known number of chunks. For example, we could implement that tags deletion will always be handled with 10 jobs max. From our previous example, we would have one job per 10'000 tags.\n\n* Currently, tags deletion is mainly slowed by the calls to the Docker API (each API call has to get all the tags from Docker API which is expensive). It's not clear how much an execution in parallel will impact the overall execution time.\n\n\n## Involved components\n\n* `Projects::ContainerRepository::CleanupTagsService` is the job that currently loops on tags. It could enqueue jobs for tags deletion.\n\n\n## Other considerations\n\n* Note that the API call is already queuing `Projects::ContainerRepository::CleanupTagsService`.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nAfter an user without an set Avatar (in user profile) comments on a design, this design could not be loaded again resulting in follownig errors:\n\n![image](/uploads/51df007e9e8e4151ad8a8247d8851c4e/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/3d89e855f1fa5b567db2993feb64d026/image.png)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Design Management must be activated.\n- Log on with a User without an set Avatar (default gray avatar icon)\n- create a new design or open an existing one and add a comment.\n- after saving the design could not be loaded any more with the error listed above.\n\nAs a workaround to fix the issue:\n* simply assign an Avatar image - afterwards the designs and comments can be loaded again.\n\n### Example Project\n\nNone for now, if the bug is not easily reproduceable I will provide one.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nSee above\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe design could be loaded with all comments without errors.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nBoth errors are observed on the client.

partial tags delete support to the API for bulk removal of tags at the project level","description":"## Summary\n\nCurrently, when using the [API for bulk removal of tags at the project level](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#delete-repository-tags-in-bulk), there is a limitation in the implementation: tags are deleted only if other tags pointing to the same digest are also selected for destruction.\n\nExample:\n* A container repository with tags `foo` and `bar` pointing to the same digest.\n* Calling `DELETE /projects/:id/registry/repositories/:repository_id/tags?name_regex=foo` will not do anything.\n\nThe proper expectation would be:\n* `foo` is deleted but not `bar`.\n\n## Improvements\n\nA safe way to implement tags have been implemented, see !16886.\n\nWe can update the API side to use this new implementation and thus, properly delete tags even if they share a common digest with tags that are not selected for destruction.\n\n## Risks\n\n* Delete tags that are not in the selection filters.\n\n## Involved components\n\n* `Projects::ContainerRepository::CleanupTagsService` should use `Projects::ContainerRepository::DeleteTagsService` instead of calling `ContainerRegistry::Tag#unsafe_delete`.\n* Investigate if it would be worth to merge `Projects::ContainerRepository::CleanupTagsService` and `Projects::ContainerRepository::DeleteTagsService` into a single service accepting several way to select tags (by array of names and/or by filters)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-21T07:36:17.997Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T08:32:01.341Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T08:32:01.307Z","closed_by":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João

Update Geo documentation to include the concept of a site","description":"At https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo.html#glossary (and all through our documentation) we refer to the Primary node and Secondary node(s).  This is fine, but for multi-node Geo setups, I feel when we're talking about all nodes within a Primary or Secondary configuration we need a new term for this.  Expanding upon the Glossary, I'd like to add a new item called 'site'.\n\nThis is what we have now (in table form):\n\n| Definition | Description |\n| ---------- | ----------- |\n| Primary node | A primary node is the single node in a Geo setup that read-write capabilities. It’s the single source of truth and the Geo secondary nodes replicate their data from there. In a Geo setup, there can only be one primary node. All secondary nodes connect to that primary. |\n| Secondary node | A secondary node is a read-only replica of the primary node running in a different geographical location. | \n\nAnd with the addition of Geo site definitions (obviously the description section needs work):\n\n| Definition | Description |\n| ---------- | ----------- |\n| Primary site | Contains all primary nodes and has read-write capabilities.  It is the single source of truth where Geo secondary sites replicate their data from.

Lack of color ramp / scale makes identifying criticality difficult and the lack a defined scale will cause issues in the future as we mature. \n\n\n4. The current color documentation in pajamas does not meet our scale needs and should be adjusted or have an alternate for severity. \n\nPajamas documentation: \n\n\u003eBlue indicates a current or active state. It communicates: management, progress, connectivity, or organization.\n\u003eGreen indicates success. It communicates: save, create, add, available, done, approved, or resolved.\n\u003eOrange indicates ‘attention-required.’ It communicates: warning, pending, missing, or impeded progress.\n\u003eRed indicates a problem. It communicates: critical states, destructive actions, errors, fails, removals, or declines.\n\n\nSecure color usage: \n\u003e Red: indicates a critical severity / new vulnerability in the MR / blacklisted license \n\u003e Orange: indicates a high severity / dependency has a vulnerability \n\u003e Blue: All severities in the history chart \n\u003e Green: fixed vulnerability in the MR / approved license / no vulnerabilities associated with a dependency \n\u003e Dark Gray: Unknown / Experimental / Undefined severity / New license \n\u003e Light Gray: Low severity \n\n\n### Goals:\n* Solution uses a color scale but does not solely rely on color\n* Solution includes a text label\n* Solution is accessible\n* Solution does not conflict with our iconography system\n* Solution is simple and easily understandable\n* Solution considers size and scale and should drive for compactness if possible\n\n### Proposal: \n\nLet's look at our color usage as a system that can grow to fit our needs as both ~\"devops::secure\" ~\"devops::defend\" mature. We should achieve this by using the current colors and design elements defined in the gitlab pattern-library and ~Pajamas so as not to create unnecessary components unless they are absolutely needed. \n\n\n#### Badges \n\n| New severity badges | \n| ------ | \n| ![Final_symbols](/uploads/9870cc057a4fac80adde3c7f891df261/Final_symbols.png) | \n\n| Secure + Defend badge and color system | \n| -

While the related request `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cpublic-project-name\u003e/merge_requests/1/test_reports.json `, the metrics are still accessible via `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cpublic-project-name\u003e/merge_requests/1/metrics_reports.json`\n\nFor public projects, GitLab allows to restrict CI pipelines to project members only (public pipelines disabled). However, in this case, the merge request widget still renders the CI metrics result, which is the outcome of a CI pipeline. These metrics are output of the CI job and should only be displayed if the visiting user has access to CI. However, right now GitLab displays the metric changes regardless of the CI permission.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTested on GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.3.0-pre a91e743e4cc \n\n1. Create a public project and push a `.gitlab-ci.yml` with following content:\n\n```yaml  \nmetrics:    \n  script:    \n    - echo 'my_metric first_value' \u003e metrics.txt    \n  artifacts:\n    reports:    \n      metrics: metrics.txt    \n```\n\n2. Create a merge request (assuming with iid 1) by modifying the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, especially by hanging the metrics line, e.g., to `- echo ''my_metric new_value' \u003e metrics.txt`\n\n3. Restrict the visibility of CI pipelines to project members only and disable public pipelines  \n4. As an anonymous user, visit the page `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cpublic-project-name\u003e/1`\n\nYou see the metrics widget rendered although the user does not have access to CI. Behind the scenes, the JSON endpoint `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cpublic-project-name\u003e/merge_requests/1/metrics_reports.json` loads this data and reveals the metrics information to unauthorized users.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers without proper access level have access to metrics information.\n\n### Examples\n\nGoto https://gitlab.com/test-public-wroup-wter-test/test-metrics/merge_requests/1/metrics_reports.json to see the metrics leaked.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsers without access to CI have access to metrics, which are tied to a merge request and are an output of CI.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUsers without proper access level should not have access to metrics.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\nBest regards,  \nXanbanx\n\n## Impact\n\nSee above.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-17T15:40:18.623Z","updated_at":"2020-04-29T13:13:21.160Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T16:27:09.724Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","HackerOne","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:12.8","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},{"id":5022822,"username":"treagitlab","name":"Tiffany Rea","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5022822/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/treagitlab"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34343","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34343","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34343/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34343/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34343","relative":"#34343","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34343"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26045292,"iid":34336,"project_id":278964,"title":"Expose sync information for Design Repositories in Geo Admin","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently, we do not show any information about the Design Repositories individual sync status in the Geo Admin panel\n\n### Intended users\n\n*  Systems Administrators\n\n### Further details\n\nThis will use the API created in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34333 to expose the information we need to display\n\nThis also will set the standard of how we pull `/admin/geo/projects` and `/admin/geo/uploads` into `Vue` in the future. \n\n### Proposal\n\nExpose a new view `/admin/geo/designs` that mimics the functionality of `/admin/geo/projects`.

However, GitLab does not currently evaluate variables in `rules:changes`, which makes this difficult. I can work around it by replacing `extends` with the explicit properties, but it makes my CI file unnecessarily verbose.\n\nWhen setting an environment variable as a path and using that variable in rules:changes, the variable is ignored.\n\n#### Example\n\n1. Create a env variable named `HELM_DIR` and set it to `helm` in the UI.\n2. Create a project that contains `helm/test.txt`\n3. Add the below `gitlab-ci.yml` script to the project:\n\n```yml\ntest0:\n  script:\n    - echo \"This is test0 and will complete\"\n    - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n    - echo $CI_PROJECT_DIR\n\ntest1:\n  script:\n    - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n    - echo $CI_PROJECT_DIR\n    - echo $HELM_DIR\n    - echo \"This is working\"\n    - ls\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n      changes:\n      - $HELM_DIR/**/*\n      when: on_success\n```\n\n4. Make a change to the `helm/test.txt` file or any file in that folder.\n\n*The below works when explicitly setting the file path*:\n\n```yml\ntest0:\n  script:\n    - echo \"This is test0 and will complete\"\n    - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n    - echo $CI_PROJECT_DIR\n\ntest1:\n  script:\n    - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n    - echo $CI_PROJECT_DIR\n    - echo \"This is working\"\n    - ls\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n      changes:\n      - helm/**/*\n      when: on_success\n```\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nSupport variable use in the `rules:changes` clause\n\nNote that `$` is a valid character in a path, so we need to enforce a rule that if `$SOMETHING` variable exists then we will replace it, otherwise we should leave `$SOMETHING` unchanged.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nNo impact\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

As brilliant as those queries are, I'm worried about the long term maintainability.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe can start with a quick POC, including figuring out how `selective_sync` is affected. \nFor this iteration only modify one data type, for example LFS objects.\n\n- [x] Refactor `find_unsynced` queries to find never-synced registry records (instead of doing a cross-database join)\n  - [x] Ensure other scopes/counts are not broken with this change\n- [x] Add backfill worker to iterate over foreign table and insert missing registry records\n  - Since we are iterating by ID range, this probably *could* use a cross-database join, either FDW or legacy. Or we could select a batch from both databases and compare it in Ruby since it's not *too* much data.\n- [x] Handle selective sync changes properly\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nFrom discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/geo-team/discussions/issues/45#note_228955133:\n\n\u003e if we assume our event system is mostly reliable, we can use the tracking database as our SSOT and make our backfill workers only responsible for creating the missing registry records.\n\nSo instead of doing an unbounded cross-database join, we can take a less responsive approach:\n\n\u003e iterates over the source foreign table and creates missing registry records\n\nDuring initial backfill, this approach is fast enough since it can easily be implemented to be faster than sync workers can pick up and sync the new records.\n\nAfter initial backfill, we rely on the event system for performant syncing. This system's role changes to picking up after edge cases (e.g. lost jobs). It doesn't need to be fast-- it doesn't need to evaluate the entire table at once (current world).\n\nNote that I labeled this ~performance since this avoids large queries, not because it improves the responsiveness of syncing.\n\n## Summary of benefits\n\n- Eliminate long selective sync queries\n- Reduce complexity\n- Eliminate FDW setup\n- Eliminate FDW maintenance (i.e. refresh foreign tables)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-16T18:43:59.216Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T20:21:44.617Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T14:11:53.217Z","closed_by":{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel

only thing we can do is reacting to this change, and wait for people to rebase their branch upon the fixed `master`).\n\nIf we want to hit 99% success rate, we should use a released/fixed version of

Since https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/15649 new epic and epic note events are properly associated with a group. But there are still old epic note events in database which don't have `group_id` set.\n\nEpic events are displayed on group activity page since 12.4 (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/16108).\n\nBecause we keep also `target_type` and `target_id` for each event (to identify event's resource), we should be able to go through all existing events which have target_type=Note and NULL `project_id` and check if the note is for Epic and assign current epic group_id to these events.\n\nThe benefit of this fix from user point of view is relatively small - he would see events about epic comments on the activity page (note that this is only about epic note events, not about epic events which were not created before - so he wouldn't still see older events about creating or closing epics). But I think it's still good to address this fix to make sure we have data in DB consistent (IOW there are no \"orphaned\" events in the DB).\n\n/cc @johnhope WDYT?

Prior to adding support for a given package manager, we need to have a task of investigation of documentation, API endpoints, and other implementation requirements. \n\nThis issue is intended to detail the requirements for the PyPI Repository MVC and link to issues outside the scope of the MVC. It will be considered complete when the product developers have broken down the MVC into sub-issues and added them to the [PyPI Repository epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2554).\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Further details\n\n#### What is PyPI\nThe Python Package Index, or PyPI, is a vast repository of open-source Python packages supplied by the worldwide community of Python developers. The official index is available at https://pypi.org, and the site itself is maintained by the Python Software Foundation.\n\n\"PyPI\" should be pronounced like \"pie pea eye\", specifically with the \"PI\" pronounced as individual letters, rather as a single sound. This minimizes confusion with the PyPy project, which is a popular alternative implementation of the Python language.\n\n#### Use cases\n1. Users can use their GitLab project as a host for their PyPI Repository.\n1. Users can use their GitLab personal access token to authenticate to their project's PyPI repository.\n1. Users can configure their choice of PyPI client tools ([setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), [twine](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine), [distutils](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/distutils.html) and pip) to create and configure a .pypirc file to reference packages stored in the repository manager. \n1. Users can install packages using `pip install` or from the CLI or GitLab CI/CD.\n1. Users can upload packages to GitLab using `twine`\n1. Users can search for packages in their PyPI repository with `pip search`\n\n#### Metadata (for the UI)\n- Name\n- Version\n- Platform\n- Summary\n- Keywords\n- Homepage\n- Download URL\n- Author\n- Author email\n- License\n\n#### Vision\nThis contributes to our vision by providing a [single application CI/CD experience](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/cicd/#single-application-cicd) for our customers and our users. And allowing us to better support Python developers. \n\n#### What's not included in this investigation\n- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) which is especially popular with data scientists. We will evaluate adding support for this after our initial release of the PyPI repository. \n\n### Proposal\nInvestigate adding PyPI support to the GitLab Package Registry. Based on that investigation, identify a reasonable MVC that can be delivered in 1-2 milestones.\n- Create, size and schedule a list of sub-issues and add them to the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2554)\n- Get feedback from the community to ensure that we will support the most common use cases and workflows.\n\n### Links / references\n-

show output from automated browser testing?","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nGitLab customers utilize Selenium to conduct cross browser test and other system tests as part of their CI jobs but cannot easily view the results of tests easily within the Gitlab GUI.\n\nThe current workaround customers may utilize is detailed in the Gitlab documentation [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/end_to_end_testing_webdriverio/#whats-next).\n\nSome initial discussion on this issue has taken place in #6061.\n\n* Opportunity Canvas (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJyyXTbbohJhHklYOuSfYyDFb1ddJrKDGp1XHu3PaKk/edit)\n* Discussion Guide (https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KBlUnV_-DnZQaIMFEZMV515FgvMa-I-8eGBw6j_YfY/edit)\n\n## Reach\n\n\u003c!-- Please describe who suffers from this problem. Consider referring to our personas, which are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Please also quantify the problem's reach using the following values, considering an aggregate across GitLab.com and self-managed:\n\n10.0 = Impacts the vast majority (~80% or greater) of our users, prospects, or customers.\n6.0 = Impacts a large percentage (~50% to ~80%) of the above.\n3.0 = Significant reach (~25% to ~50%).\n1.5 = Small reach (~5% to ~25%).\n0.5 = Minimal reach (Less than ~5%). --\u003e\n\nThis problem impacts Sasha, Presley and Parker as they work together to build and deploy web based solutions.\n\nWe estimate the reach of this problem is small or 5% - 25% of the customer base (1.5).\n\n## Impact\n\n\u003c!-- How do we positively impact the users above and GitLab's business by solving this problem? Please describe briefly, and provide a numerical assessment:\n\n3.0 = Massive impact\n2.0 = High impact\n1.0 = Medium impact\n0.5 = Low impact\n0.25 = Minimal impact --\u003e\n\nBy solving this problem for our users they can more effectively see testing issues as they are being recorded in the CI view and quickly resolve them. Given there is a workaround for this today we believe this is a medium impact (1.0).\n\n## Confidence\n\n\u003c!-- How do we know this is a problem? Please provide and link to any supporting information (e.g. data, customer verbatims) and use this basis to provide a numerical assessment on our confidence level in this problem's severity:\n\n100% = High confidence\n80% = Medium confidence\n50% = Low confidence --\u003e\n\nWe have Medium confidence (80%) that this is a problem and the proposed solution will solve it based on interactions in the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6061) and previous experience with showing results in the CI view.\n\n## Effort\n\n\u003c!-- How much effort do we think it will be to solve this problem? Please include all counterparts (Product, UX, Engineering, etc) in your assessment and quantify the number of person-months needed to dedicate to the effort.\n\nFor example, if the solution will take a product manager, designer, and engineer two weeks of effort - you may quantify this as 1.5 (based on 0.5 months x 3 people). --\u003e\n\nFor the MVC we believe we can reuse some existing UX and front end work previously done for other [CI views](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/35379). Building this MVC to learn further from internal stake holders and customers will enable future validation cycles to further the product vision for [System Testing](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/system_testing/). \n\n* PM .5\n* Designer .5\n* Frontend Engineer 1\n* Backend Engineer 1\n\nTotal 2.5\n\nThe total RICE score for this item is 48 = (1.5 x 1 x 80) / 2.5","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-15T17:06:01.144Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T15:27:06.776Z","closed_at":"2020-02-17T15:27:06.727Z","closed_by":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"labels":["Category:System Testing","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","missed:12.5","missed:12.7","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4554255,"username":"jj-ramirez","name":"Juan J.

This will give DAST engineers an opportunity to test changes before go live. For risky features, engineers can choose to delay a release to have more opportunity to use the feature and find issues.\n\nThe scheduler also updated the latest tagged version of DAST. For example, DAST version `1.5.1` is released based on the git tag `v1.5.1`. When the scheduler runs, it updates the `1.5.1` DAST docker tag from a build using the latest commit in `master`. This means that our clients cannot pin to a particular version of DAST, because it gets changed anyway.\n\nThe original intention of the scheduler was to make it easy to update DAST with the latest ZAProxy weekly base image. Since this time, the ZAProxy base image has been pinned to a specific week. This reduces the risk of releasing a broken image (it's broken at the time of writing).\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Delete the scheduler setup in DAST Gitlab CI.\n- Revert https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/commit/3d938a6f1dbaa0f22e2f38b1bc6338ec025df2c5 to remove the scheduled

You'll need to test this in a monorepository containing a large number of files.\n2.  Create a CODEOWNERS file listing decent number of directories and owners. This is important for us to demonstrate that the checks may return some, all or none of the Code Owners\n3.  Create a change affecting a large number of files in a branch and create the merge request.\n4.  Allow the merge request to process. Once it's completed you'll find:\n    a)  The list of affected files in the MR is incomplete\n    b)  Some, all or none of the Code Owners approvals will be required based on how many of the files in the Merge Request \n        were processed.\n5.

Run $ git log --stat [commit SHA] to confirm the full set of changes against the GitLab changes.\n \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe Changes list is incomplete in the merge request, and the CODEOWNERS check may or may not catch all the changes affecting CODEOWNERS.

Writes to ElasticSearch and use the Bulk API","description":"# Problem\n\nAt present we are writing to ElasticSearch for every change to every model. These very [frequent writes to ElasticSearch cause performance issues at scale](https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-keeping-elasticsearch-in-sync#the-problems-of-too-frequent-updates-and-non-batch-updates).\n\nIt seems very plausible that before we reach all of GitLab.com scale we're likely to need to buffer/batch these updates and use the bulk API.\n\nIt's also plausible that our current implementation is not adequate for our largest self-hosted customers.\n\n# Solution\n\nSummarised from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34086#note_230326472\n\n1. Updates to models go into sorted sets in Redis rather than queued as sidekiq jobs.\n1. A periodic sidekiq worker runs every 1 minute and pops the top 1k update jobs from the sorted set\n1. The 1k update jobs are transformed into a bulk update for Elasticsearch\n1. Failed updates are retried\n\n## Likely follow up issues\n\n1. Timeouts for updates are retried in increasingly smaller batches similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/195774 . This may be preferable to do in a follow up issue since running this every 1 minute likely won't build up large payloads (ie. we're unlikely to hit 1k jobs in a minute until we roll this out more widely)\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/205148\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/205178\n\n## Feature flag\n\nThis functionality is gated behind a default-off feature flag: `:elastic_bulk_incremental_updates` .

So, if Gitlab public project has github private project mirrored URL, unauthorized users will see the url of private project from github.\n\nIf the url is from public project of github, this gives them idea about the branch names and files in current gitlab project despite they dont see repository in gitlab .\n\nThis also happens in gitlab private project too where guest is able to see the mirrored URL.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_2019-10-07_at_00.07.57.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7cc5afb7-63e1-46c8-8ef5-adedbfd16242/Screenshot_2019-10-07_at_00.07.57.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-14T23:24:30.025Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T07:07:22.315Z","closed_at":"2020-04-14T07:17:58.486Z","closed_by":{"id":4901936,"username":"dskim_gitlab","name":"Sincheol (David) Kim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/84a984a56c54d1d31338678421cecc32?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dskim_gitlab"},"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","group::source code","missed-deliverable","missed:12.9","priority::4","severity::4"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":4901936,"username":"dskim_gitlab","name":"Sincheol (David) Kim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/84a984a56c54d1d31338678421cecc32?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dskim_gitlab"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4901936,"username":"dskim_gitlab","name":"Sincheol (David) Kim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/84a984a56c54d1d31338678421cecc32?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dskim_gitlab"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-01-13","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34079","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34079","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34079/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34079/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34079","relative":"#34079","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34079"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25930087,"iid":34078,"project_id":278964,"title":"Extend audit events API for groups","description":"## Problem\n\nWe added the first iteration of the Audit Events API in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/121.

choose to remove images on merge\n\n### Documentation\n- [Container Registry User Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/index.html)\n\n### Testing\n- We are currently working to [improve the performance of the image removal process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31832), and since this will likely have many images to remove when first implemented, we should ensure that the performance meets our standards. \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like we can help our customers and ourselves lower the cost of storage for the Container Registry. \n- We can measure this for gitlab.com (once we can run garbage collection) by looking at the overall cost of storage.\n- We can also measure the total number of images over time and we should see a significant decrease in the that number and then see it level off over time.
