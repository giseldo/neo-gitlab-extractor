It seems that it's caused when `sbt` attempts to create a socket on either an NFS-mounted share, or a directory that Docker mounts from a host container using the `-v` (Bind mount a volume) flag.\n\nAs explained in the linked issue, there are at least two workarounds:\n\n1. Pass the arguments `--batch -Dsbt.server.forcestart=true` to the `sbt` command:\n\n   ```shell\n   sbt --batch -Dsbt.server.forcestart=true -no-colors dependencyDot\n   ```\n\n1. Copy the `CI_PROJECT_DIR` to another location, for example:\n\n   ```shell\n   $ git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium.git\n   $ docker run -it --rm -v \"$PWD/gemnasium/qa/fixtures/scala-sbt/default:/shared-dir\" \\\n     -e SECURE_LOG_LEVEL=debug registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-maven:3 bash\n   \n   root@e6518e337cc9:~# cp -R /shared-dir /ci-project-dir \u0026\u0026 cd /ci-project-dir\n   root@ce4a97b253fd:/ci-project-dir# sbt -no-colors dependencyDot\n   ```\n\nI prefer option `1.` because it requires less code changes and is easier to implement.\n\n/cc @fcatteau @gonzoyumo @sam.white","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-25T12:25:54.151Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T14:07:24.565Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T03:26:12.263Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363487","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363487","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363487/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363487/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363487","relative":"#363487","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363487"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":109081137,"iid":363468,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix status box styling on Jira issue details page","description":"There is a minor UI issue in Jira issue details page as noted in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/88160#note_958517516):\n\n\u003e I also noticed a small UI issue not related to this MR (it's also on master) while testing the Jira issues (the `Open` status box shows both the icon and text).

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel.

But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Create the folder structure above:\n    - In the first commit, add the `alpha` folder and it's contents, and set the commit message to \"alpha\".\n    - In the first commit, add the `beta` folder and it's contents, and set the commit message to \"beta\".\n1. Open the \"beta\" folder and observe that all the files in this folder have the \"beta\" commit message and timestamps.\n2. Using the breadcrumbs, navigate to the parent folder and then click into the \"alpha\" folder.\n3. At this point, the files in the \"alpha\" folder will show \"beta\" as the commit message along with the beta timestamps, with the exception of the \"alpha\" file.\n4. If you then refresh the page, the \"alpha\" files will then show the correct \"alpha\" commit message and timestamps.\n\nSee the video for a run through of the bug:\n\n![Untitled__2_](/uploads/5860733bce1be07d07056daeae21edaa/Untitled__2_.mp4)\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/anton-bugs/292414\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen files have similar filenames between different subfolders, the incorrect commit message and timestamp is sometimes shown.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen files have similar filenames between different subfolders, the correct commit message and timestamp should be always shown.\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThis bug seems to be caused by the `:lazy_load_commits` feature that is enabled on GitLab.com https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342497\n\nThis feature is disabled by default on self managed, where the problem cannot be

Existing users configure API scans using a sub-set of the DAST configuration variables. During our development of DAST API, backwards support for the API related `DAST_` variables was wanted, and support was added from some of them. This was to enable a transparent migration of users and also on-demand scans. However, as development proceeded it became clear that we should have separation between the two variable sets, ci templates, etc. DAST API configuration now occurs through `DAST_API_` prefixed variables, different CI templates, etc.\n\nWith the work done on the on-demand scans to allow using DAST API instead of DAST for API related scans, the code doesn't cleanly set only `DAST_` or `DAST_API_` variables. It is expected that the resulting configuration will contain both `DAST_` and `DAST_API_` prefixed variables. This wouldn't be a problem, except, the API Security code still contains support for some of the `DAST_` variables. This could pose a problem at some point.\n\nThe more pressing concern as we head towards a general release is users who use both analyzers. Consider this case: A user who has DAST configured with active scans with variables set globally (very common), adds in DAST API in passive mode to give it a shot. By supporting `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED` we might run an active scan instead of passive.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove the three `DAST_` variables from `worker-entry`. The variables have never been documented and pose a risk for users who use both DAST and DAST API, or on-demand scans. While on-demand scans will work in their current form, future changes could cause problems.\n\nThe most dangerous variable to keep is `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED`. A user who has both DAST and DAST API configured could set this variable globally, inadvertently affecting DAST API scans.\n\nVariables to be removed:\n\n- `DAST_HOST_OVERRIDE` (will continue to be available as `DAST_API_HOST_OVERRIDE`)\n- `DAST_REQUEST_HEADERS` (will continue to be available as `DAST_API_REQUEST_HEADERS`)\n- `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED`","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-25T00:29:57.449Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T18:41:30.427Z","closed_at":"2022-06-13T18:41:30.410Z","closed_by":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"labels":["Category:API Security","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"}],"author":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363422","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363422","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363422/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363422/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363422","relative":"#363422","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363422"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":109063024,"iid":363420,"project_id":278964,"title":"Eng: Update Subgroup creation page","description":"# Summary\n \nThe goal of this issue is to update the subgroup creation experience seen below.

The current [query plan](https://console.postgres.ai/gitlab/gitlab-production-tunnel-pg12/sessions/10124/commands/35721) using `recursive CTE` shows it takes `679.987 ms` and processes ~5.70 GiB to return 20 rows.\n1. The [elastic logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/d9a640b0-d589-11ec-a125-c377a8daf518) show the current query using `transversal ids` to be quite slow (`~2.4s`) to return a result.\n   - _Note: The `use_traversal_ids` feature flag is enabled on gitlab.com._\n\nAs a result a ~database maintainer [recommended](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85817#note_953949776) we first improve the current query before we add additional filters (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7879) that reduces performance even more.\n\n### Additional information\n\nDefault query parameters used in the [compliance report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_report/):\n\n- Date range: `30 days`\n- Sort: `SEVERITY_LEVEL_DESC`\n- Limit: `20`\n\n## Recommendations\n\nAs noted by @krasio in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85817#note_953949776), the  compliance violations query suffers from [performance problems with `IN` queries](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/efficient_in_operator_queries.html#performance-problems-with-in-queries):\n\n\u003e If we create a index on `merge_requests_compliance_violations (merge_request_id, severity_level DESC, id DESC)` we can apply the solution described in the above guide. This will only for sorting on `severity_level DESC, id DESC`, other orders will need their own index. Not sure how easy (or even possible) will it be to combine this solution with GraphQL.\n\n\u003e The gist of it will look something like\n\n```ruby\nGitlab::Pagination::Keyset::InOperatorOptimization::QueryBuilder.new(\n  scope: MergeRequests::ComplianceViolation.order(order),\n  array_scope: MergeRequest::Metrics.where(target_project_id: Group.find(22).all_projects.select(:id), merged_at: (Time.now - 1.month).beginning_of_day..Time.now.end_of_day).select(:merge_request_id),\n  array_mapping_scope: -\u003e (id_expression) { MergeRequests::ComplianceViolation.where(MergeRequests::ComplianceViolation.arel_table[:merge_request_id].eq(id_expression)) },\n  finder_query: -\u003e (severity_level_expression, id_expression) { MergeRequests::ComplianceViolation.where(MergeRequests::ComplianceViolation.arel_table[:id].eq(id_expression)) }\n).execute.limit(20)\n```\n\n\u003e Which will produce query like the https://console.postgres.ai/gitlab/gitlab-production-tunnel-pg12/sessions/10199/commands/36162. :scream_cat: This all is to improve the current query. Then we can think of applying filter by protected branches (the goal of this MR), which may or may not work.\n\nWith the optimization the results improve from `679.987 ms` to `200.187 ms`, and data processed from ~5.70 GiB to ~246.10 MiB.\n\n### Considerations\n\nBefore we consider using `InOperatorOptimization` we should answer the following:\n\n1. Is it compatible with GraphQL resolvers?\n1. We'd need to create 8 indexes, one for each [SORT](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#complianceviolationsort) type, is that feasible?\n1. Is this approach compatible with optional filters?\n1. Would it support additional filters like branch names or status https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7879 that add additional `IN` queries?\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n...","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-24T11:54:41.312Z","updated_at":"2022-12-19T04:13:42.492Z","closed_at":"2022-12-13T06:53:27.295Z","closed_by":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Next Up","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","approaching-SLO","backend","bug::performance","database","devops::govern","group::compliance","missed-SLO","missed:15.3","priority::1","section::sec","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"}],"author":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363357","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":4,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363357","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363357/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363357/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363357","relative":"#363357","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363357"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7916,"epic":{"id":502210,"iid":7916,"title":"MVP filter violations by all branches or all protected branches","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7916","group_id":9970,"human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e272\u003c/strong\u003e days elapsed"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":109031230,"iid":363351,"project_id":278964,"title":"Metrics dictionary -

We have updated the logic for this setting to now check a deployment when it starts, and if it is outdated due to a more recent deployment, it will not continue to proceed. This ensures that outdated deployments are not accidentally executed and overwrite more recent code changes in production.\n\n### Problem\n\nThis is one of the biggest issues of the [Skip outdated deployment jobs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/101318/diffs#a3ddc8d862f2263dedb2eef488ecceadc7aec347) feature.\n\nCurrently, skip-evaluation happens when a deployment _finished_, meaning old deployments can still be manually-executed/retried after the finish. We have to evaluate it when a deployment starts, and if it's outdated, it should transition to `failed` state. (Keep in mind that technically we should [transition to `skipped` state](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363327))\n\nThe current logic was introduced in [the issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25276) three years ago and the shape was not good enough to be actually used in customer's project.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe revisit the core logic of this feature. Provided that the feature is enabled in a project:\n\n- When a deployment job is about to run, we check if the deployment's SHA is behind the _latest/current_ deployment's SHA.\n  - If it's behind, we fail the job. e.g. `running` =\u003e `failed` state transition.\n  - If it's not behind, we don't do anything.\n- If possible, we extend `state_machine` in `Ci::Build` as SSOT. If this's not acceptable, we extend the service classes to trigger the state transition, such as `Ci::ProcessBuildService` (for auto execution), `Ci::PlayBuildService` (for manual execution) and `Ci::RetryJobService` (for auto/manual retry).\n- The check requires Git operation (i.e. Gitaly call). We need to make sure that the process is cheap enough that doesn't cause performance degredation on GitLab CI.\n- The current logic will be superseded by the new core logic. We should gradually rollout the new logic with a feature flag and phase out the old logic i.e. `DropOlderDeploymentsWorker`.\n\nYou can see a [PoC MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91225) to see the proposed code changes.\n\n### Related\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255978#note_957873717\n- [Initial iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25276)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-24T10:08:57.729Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T16:24:08.018Z","closed_at":"2022-10-20T09:25:31.503Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","GitLab Free","Next Up","backend","customer","devops::release","feature::enhancement","group::release","missed:15.3","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":9396342,"username":"acook.gitlab","name":"Allen Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9396342/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acook.gitlab"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9396342,"username":"acook.gitlab","name":"Allen Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9396342/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acook.gitlab"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363328","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363328","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363328/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363328/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363328","relative":"#363328","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363328"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8127,"epic":{"id":529856,"iid":8127,"title":"Improve \"Skip outdated deployment jobs\" feature","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8127","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":109025478,"iid":363320,"project_id":278964,"title":"Frontend: Update variable type dropdown to the gitlab-ui dropdown component","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used as a great starting point for feature requests.

Infrastructure Registry","description":"### Summary\n\nWe have a [customer](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/292233) that has a problem with unauthenticated access of Terraform module when using Infrastructure Registry on public projects.\n\nWhen running `terraform init`, without any credentials, they saw the following error:\n\n```\n│ Could not download module \"my_module_name\" (config.tf:5) source code from\n│ \"https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/terraform/modules/v1/example-namespace/mymodule/system/0.0.1/file?token=INSERT_TOKEN_HERE\u0026archive=tgz\":\n│ bad response code: 401.\n```\n\nHowever, they were able to download the module unauthenticated when accessing the URL to download the module directly on the browser.\n\nI was also able to reproduce this on GitLab.com.\n\nThis is my test public project: https://gitlab.com/jdasmarinas/nfs-test\n\nThis is my example `config.tf` file:\n\n```\nmodule \"my_module_name\" {\n  source = \"gitlab.com/jdasmarinas/mymodule/system\"\n  version = \"0.0.1\"\n}\n```\n\nRunning `terraform init` returns the following error:\n\n```\n│ Error: Failed to download module\n│\n│ Could not download module \"my_module_name\" (config.tf:1) source code from\n│ \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/terraform/modules/v1/jdasmarinas/mymodule/system/0.0.1/file?token=INSERT_TOKEN_HERE\u0026archive=tgz\":\n│ bad response code: 401.\n╵\n```\n\nHowever, if you type any of the URL below, directly in the browser, even if you are logged out of GitLab, you will be able to access the module unauthenticated.\n\n* `https://gitlab.com/jdasmarinas/nfs-test/-/package_files/38844595/download` - from the Web UI.\n* `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/terraform/modules/v1/jdasmarinas/mymodule/system/0.0.1/file?archive=tgz` - API without the `token` field.\n\nI think the reason it's failing when done via Terraform

[x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_docker_image_pull_policy true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_docker_image_pull_policy true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_docker_image_pull_policy true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com ci_docker_image_pull_policy true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_docker_image_pull_policy true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_docker_image_pull_policy \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_docker_image_pull_policy \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_docker_image_pull_policy true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_docker_image_pull_policy --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_docker_image_pull_policy --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_docker_image_pull_policy`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_docker_image_pull_policy`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_docker_image_pull_policy` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_docker_image_pull_policy --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_docker_image_pull_policy --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_docker_image_pull_policy`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_docker_image_pull_policy false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-23T11:17:46.302Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T15:16:34.315Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T08:11:19.469Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","feature::addition","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363186","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":51,"completed_count":9},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"9 of 51 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363186","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363186/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363186/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363186","relative":"#363186","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363186"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":65958,"iid":78,"sequence":23,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-06-24T00:05:02.620Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T00:05:02.060Z","start_date":"2022-08-22","due_date":"2022-09-04","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/65958"},"health_status":null},{"id":108967684,"iid":363179,"project_id":278964,"title":"Address the technical debt for the focus ring","description":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/88028 has introduced some technical debt issues related to use of HEX colors and styles directly in the stylesheets instead of gl-color codes or utilities.

isolation in image integration test examples","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352464+ added support for copying the entire fixtures directory each time the image integration test suite is executed. This change provides isolation of fixture files between separate runs of the _entire test suite_, however, it does not provide isolation for each _example_.\n\nTo understand the impact of this, let's assume we have the following `image_spec.rb`:\n\n```ruby\ncontext \"with go-modules\" do\n  let(:project) { \"go-modules/default\" }\n\n  it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\nend\n```\n\nThe above test causes the analyzer to be executed once and populates the fixtures directory with the following generated artifacts and reports:\n\n```shell\n.\n└── tmp/\n    └── qa-63192/\n        └── fixtures/\n            └── go-modules/\n                └── default/\n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff   413 May 19 16:14 go.mod                                // fixture file\n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff  2278 May 19 16:14 go.sum                                // fixture file\n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff  4213 May 19 16:15 cyclonedx-go-go.json                  // generated artifact\n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff   132 May 19 16:15 sbom-manifest.json                    // generated artifact\n                    └── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff 11418 May 19 16:15 gl-dependency-scanning-report.json    // generated report\n```\n\nThe `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` in the above has a size of `11418` bytes and contains both vulnerabilities and dependency_files:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"14.0.4\",\n  \"vulnerabilities\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"2ed8c35d5b30adb3a8cf1de0ee6e46453dcfea98d8e308b43de35415c5972980\",\n      \"category\": \"dependency_scanning\",\n      \"name\": \"Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling\",\n      \"details\": {\n        \"vulnerable_package\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"name\": \"Vulnerable Package\",\n          \"value\": \"github.com/minio/minio:v0.0.0-20180419184637-5a16671f721f\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n  ],\n  \"dependency_files\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"go.sum\",\n      \"package_manager\": \"go\",\n      \"dependencies\": [\n        {\n          \"package\": {\n            \"name\": \"github.com/astaxie/beego\"\n          },\n          \"version\": \"v1.10.0\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scan\": {\n    \"scanner\": {\n      \"id\": \"gemnasium\",\n      \"name\": \"Gemnasium\",\n      \"url\": \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\",\n      \"vendor\": {\n        \"name\": \"GitLab\"\n      },\n      \"version\": \"2.38.0\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"dependency_scanning\",\n    \"start_time\": \"2022-05-23T08:10:01\",\n    \"end_time\": \"2022-05-23T08:10:04\",\n    \"status\": \"success\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n         \nIf we update the above spec to include a second context as follows, and run the test suite again:\n\n```ruby\ncontext \"with go-modules\" do\n  let(:project) { \"go-modules/default\" }\n\n  context \"when not using DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\" do\n    it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\n  end\n\n  context \"when using DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\" do\n    let(:variables) { { \"DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\": \"/go.sum\" } }\n\n    it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis causes the analyzer to be run _twice_, once when `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` is not configured, and once when `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` is configured. An unfortunate side effect of executing two tests is that the second test will _overwrite_ the `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` from the first test, which we can see by looking at the file size for the `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` report in the fixtures directory and noticing that when we ran a single test, it was `11418` bytes, but now that we're running two tests, it's only `445` bytes:\n\n```shell\n.\n└── tmp/\n    └── qa-7854/\n        └── fixtures/\n            └── go-modules/\n                └── default/\n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff   413 May 19 16:22 go.mod                                // fixture file      \n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff  2278 May 19 16:22 go.sum                                // fixture file      \n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff  4213 May 19 16:23 cyclonedx-go-go.json                  // generated artifact\n                    ├── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff   132 May 19 16:23 sbom-manifest.json                    // generated artifact\n                    └── -rw-r--r--  1 adam  staff   445 May 19 16:23 gl-dependency-scanning-report.json    // generated report  \n```\n\nAlso, the `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` in the above does not contain any vulnerabilities or dependency_files:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"14.0.4\",\n  \"vulnerabilities\": [],\n  \"scan\": {\n    \"scanner\": {\n      \"id\": \"gemnasium\",\n      \"name\": \"Gemnasium\",\n      \"url\": \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\",\n      \"vendor\": {\n        \"name\": \"GitLab\"\n      },\n      \"version\": \"2.38.0\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"dependency_scanning\",\n    \"start_time\": \"2022-05-23T08:15:05\",\n    \"end_time\": \"2022-05-23T08:15:10\",\n    \"status\": \"success\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhat's happening is the second `context \"when using DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\"` in the above test has overwritten the `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` report produced by the first test in `context \"when not using DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\"`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn order to provide test isolation and prevent tests from interfering with each other, we can change the name of top level directory that represents the entire test suite to `test-*` instead of `qa-*`, and then each time the analyzer is executed, we copy over only the fixture files for the specific test being run, and name it after the rspec example it represents, such as [`running-image-with-test-project-with-go-modules-behaves-like-successful-scan-creates-a-report`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/add14250d79425e40d2d7724de34a3906d826fda/spec/image_spec.rb#L203):\n\n```shell\n.\n└── tmp/\n    └── test-63192/\n        └── go-modules/\n            └── default/\n                ├── running-image-with-test-project-with-go-modules-behaves-like-successful-scan-creates-a-report/\n                │   ├── go.mod\n                │   ├── go.sum\n                │   ├── cyclonedx-go-go.json\n                │   ├── sbom-manifest.json\n                │   └── gl-dependency-scanning-report.json\n                └── running-image-with-test-project-with-go-modules-when-excluding-go.sum-with-ds_excluded_paths-behaves-like-successful-scan-creates-a-report/\n                    ├── go.mod\n                    ├── go.sum\n                    ├── cyclonedx-go-go.json\n                    ├── sbom-manifest.json\n                    └── gl-dependency-scanning-report.json\n```\n\nI believe we can obtain the rspec example description by adding some additional code to the `image_spec.rb`, as follows:\n\n```ruby\ndescription = \"\"\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.before :example do |x|\n    description = x.metadata[:full_description].downcase.gsub(\" \", \"-\")\n  end\nend\n\ndescribe \"running image\" do\n  let(:fixtures_dir) { File.expand_path(\"../qa/fixtures\", __dir__) }\n\n  context \"with test project\" do\n    let(:scan) do\n      GitlabSecure::IntegrationTest::DockerRunner.run_with_cache(\n        image_name, target_dir, description,\n        command: command,\n        script: script,\n        offline: offline,\n        variables: global_vars.merge(variables))\n    end\n\n    let(:report) { scan.report }\n\n    context \"with go-modules\" do\n      let(:project) { \"go-modules/default\" }\n\n      it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\n\n      context \"when excluding go.sum with DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\" do\n        let(:variables) { { \"DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\": \"/go.sum\" } }\n\n        it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis would have the following behaviour:\n\n1. Tests won't interfere with each other.\n1. Each test fixture is named after the rspec example it represents, making it easy to figure out which fixture directory corresponds to which test.\n1. We'll end up producing a complete copy of the qa directory for each test. For `gemnasium v3`, this is currently `5.6MB` and there are `31` individual contexts so we'd end up creating around `31*5.6MB = 173MB` of temporary files each time the spec is run, for `gemnasium` alone.\n\nI'm sure we can optimize the process and reduce the amount of space required by not copying over the expectation directory each time, perhaps we could even copy over only the exact fixtures directory related to the test being run.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. [ ] Update the [Fixtures class](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/c10e5bb/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/fixtures.rb#L1-1):\n\n   - Add new arguments to the [initialize](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/c10e5bb/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/fixtures.rb#L14-14) method:\n\n      ```diff\n      -      def initialize(original_target_dir)\n      +      def initialize(relative_fixtures_dir, original_target_dir, description)\n      ```\n   - Place fixture files in `tmp/test-*` instead of `tmp/qa-*`\n   - Copy the fixtures for the specific test from the original `qa/fixtures/\u003cpath/to/test\u003e` directory to a directory named after the rspec example. For example, let's assume we start with the following project structure:\n\n     ```ruby\n     context \"with go-modules\" do\n       let(:project) { \"go-modules/default\" }\n     \n       it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\n     \n       it_behaves_like \"recorded report\" do\n         let(:recorded_report) { parse_expected_report(project) }\n       end\n     \n       context \"when excluding go.sum with DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\" do\n         let(:variables) { { \"DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS\": \"/go.sum\" } }\n     \n         it_behaves_like \"successful scan\"\n       end\n     end\n     ```\n     \n     This will now produce two separate fixture directories, named after each rspec context they represent:\n     \n     ```shell\n     .\n     └── gemnasium/\n         ├── qa/\n         │   ├── scripts\n         │   ├── expect\n         │   └── fixtures/\n         │       └── go-modules/\n         │           └── default/\n         │               ├── go.mod\n         │               └── go.sum\n         └── tmp/\n             └── test-63192/\n                 └── go-modules/\n                     └── default/\n                         ├── running-image-with-test-project-with-go-modules-behaves-like-successful-scan-creates-a-report/\n                         │   ├── go.mod\n                         │   ├── go.sum\n                         │   ├── cyclonedx-go-go.json\n                         │   ├── sbom-manifest.json\n                         │   └── gl-dependency-scanning-report.json\n                         └── running-image-with-test-project-with-go-modules-when-excluding-go.sum-with-ds_excluded_paths-behaves-like-successful-scan-creates-a-report/\n                             ├── go.mod\n                             ├── go.sum\n                             ├── cyclonedx-go-go.json\n                             ├── sbom-manifest.json\n                             └── gl-dependency-scanning-report.json\n     ```\n   - Add a new `relative_expectation_dir` argument to the [assert_files_match_expectations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/c10e5bb/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/shared_examples/shared_functions.rb#L9-33) method, which will be passed from any spec that uses the [recorded CycloneDX files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/c10e5bb/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/shared_examples/cyclonedx_shared_examples.rb#L14-18) or [recorded SBOM manifest](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/c10e5bb/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/shared_examples/sbom_manifest_shared_examples.rb#L12-16) shared examples\n   - Update unit tests in the integration-test project to test the new behaviour\n   - Update [run_with_cache](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/c10e5bb/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/docker_runner.rb#L28-36) in the `DockerRunner` class to accept new arguments:\n\n     - `fixtures_dir`\n     - `expectations_dir`\n     - `description`\n\n     This has been implemented by: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/merge_requests/29+.\n\n1. [x] Update the following image spec files:\n\n      - [gemnasium_image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/7150b07/spec/gemnasium_image_spec.rb#L1-1)\n      - [gemnasium-maven_image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/7150b07/spec/gemnasium-maven_image_spec.rb#L1-1)\n      - [gemnasium-python_image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/7150b07/spec/gemnasium-python_image_spec.rb#L1-1)\n\n      These spec files need to be updated to set `let(:relative_expectation_dir) { project }` for any `SBOM Manifest` or `CycloneDX SBOMs` contexts. They also need to pass a description to `DockerRunner.run_with_cache` containing the `rspec example` name.\n\n     This has been implemented by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/340+.\n\n/cc @fcatteau @gonzoyumo","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-23T08:43:51.050Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T23:30:07.650Z","closed_at":"2022-07-01T01:22:32.907Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","priority::3","section::sec","test","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363162","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":1},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363162","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363162/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363162/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363162","relative":"#363162","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363162"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":108953019,"iid":363155,"project_id":278964,"title":"VSA: Add end event timestamp to table - backend","description":"This issue is to address the backend part of #353554:\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrently, the VSA table can only be sorted by [duration (time)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357824).

This prompted me to look a bit closer to those integrations.\n\nIt turns out that the integration settings page contains a worse leakage of these tokens, and is still present after the latest patch.\n\nWhen a maintainer/owner configures integrations that adds a webhook event to the project (such as CI/CD integrations like Buildkite and Drone) the user is prompted to add an URL to the integration and an `access token`. The access token field is write only (and as of 14.10.1 also a password field) and will not display the present integration setting. So after saving the integration the token field will be empty to not leak this token.\n\n![hiddentoken.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ddb7c9b2-4289-49a0-bb1c-94b29eb897b2/hiddentoken.jpg)\n\nThe problem is that after saving and activating the integration, a list is displayed in the bottom of the screen where the webhook log is displayed. If any maintainer of the project click to `view details` on any of these log entries the user will be presented with a page displaying the call that was made. Including the secret tokens!\n\n![token.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/99bbb25e-5565-4464-921e-a706cec4e633/token.jpg)\n\nI will come back with a full list of affected integrations if needed. I have tested 4 which are affected at the moment\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create two users `victim` and `attacker`  \n2. Log in as `victim`  \n3. Create a new project and go to https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/project_members  \n4. Invite `attacker` as a maintainer to the project  \n5. Go to https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/drone_ci/edit  \n6. fill in the url `https://example.com` (this does not matter) and the access token `HIDDEN_TOKEN`  \n7. Click save  \n8. Click `Test settings`, a test hook call will be made  \n9. Refresh the page  \n10. There will be a failed hook call in the logs. Click `view details`  \n11. The page will display the access token in a `\u003ch1\u003e` title  \n12. Copy the URL, log in with `attacker` and go to the same page  \n13.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete web_hooks_rate_limit_paid --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete web_hooks_rate_limit_paid --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete web_hooks_rate_limit_paid`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `web_hooks_rate_limit_paid`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `web_hooks_rate_limit_paid` feature flag.

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThere is a snippet produced to install the Kubernetes Agent. It is something along the lines of:\n\n```shell\nhelm upgrade --install gitlab-agent gitlab/gitlab-agent --namespace gitlab-agent --create-namespace --set config.token=\u003ctoken\u003e --set config.kasAddress=wss://kas.gitlab.com\n```\n\nThe problem is that when a user installs multiple agents in the same cluster, the `helm upgrade --install` command will overwrite the old installation with just a different token, effectively breaking the old agent (as there is no installation for that token anymore).\n\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo minimize the risk of conflict, use the agent name as the helm release name. For example, in the above command, change `gitlab-agent` to `\u003cagent-name\u003e`:\n\n```shell\nhelm upgrade --install \u003cagent-name\u003e gitlab/gitlab-agent --namespace gitlab-agent --create-namespace --set config.token=\u003ctoken\u003e --set config.kasAddress=wss://kas.gitlab.com\n```\n\nThis also makes the snippet more developer friendly as each agent is easier to identify in the cluster afterwards.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Create an epic in one group.\n1. Create a project in the same group.\n1. Create two issues in that project, and add them both to the epic.\n1. Transfer the project to a different group.\n\nAt this point, you should see that the other group now has two epics with the same name as the first, but only one has the two issues (the other has zero).\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nThis is only visible to GitLab team members, but you can see this behavior in the following link:\n\n[Example transfer destination group epics list](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-gold/a.conrad-test/transfer-destination/-/epics?state=opened\u0026page=1\u0026sort=start_date_desc)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nDuplicate epics are created in the destination group.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nOnly one version of each epic should exist in the destination group after a project is transferred to it. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\nPlease see the following graph representing the before and after states of this bug

As we are moving individual tab apps to a unified Vue app, there will eventually be only one `Vuex.Store` instance. So, individual stores need to be converted to store modules that can be registered seamlessly to any store.\n\nAs part of this issue, we need to convert **License Compliance**'s store to a module which involves the following:\n\n- [x] The Vuex store should be created in the app's entry point rather than its `store/index.js` file.\n    - [ ] Move `Vue.use(Vuex)` to the app's entry point.\n    - [x] `store/index.js` only returns the store's options.\n    - [x] The store is instantiated with `new Vuex.Store` in the entry point.\n- [x] The stores should be converted to namespaced modules.\n    - [x] In `store/index.js`, place all options into a namespaced module.\n    - [x] Optionally, move state, actions, mutations and getters files to a sub-directory.\n    - [x] Review all `map*` helper usages so that they properly map to the module rather than the root.\n- [x] The app's root component should register its module(s) in the `created` hook. This can be done with the `registerModule` method. More on this in https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html#dynamic-module-registration.\n\n\n## Updated Strategy\n\nThe VueX migration into the parent App https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363079 doesn't seem to be a blocker since it works without it. I am still working on it though. Having it completed would just mean that the vuex module is accessable between tabs, which I don't see a need to at the moment. I see the value in a consistent implementation though.\n\nAs I discussed with @pgascouvaillancourt on slack, the license tab is used both in the pipeline tab and the current version of the MR widget. That MR widget is being migrated to the new MR widget extension this milestone as well. So next milestone 15.3, we should be down to one usage of the vue component used in the license tab.\n\nLuckily the license management store is already a namespaced VueX module :smile: \n\nMy plan for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363079 is to prep a MR for %15.3\n\n1. Update the component to not initialize it's own store, and do it from the parent app its bootstrapped from (pipeline tabs). After 15.2 this should be only on the pipeline tab as opposed to the pipeline tab AND MR widgets on the MR page.\n\nThe problem right now is that the store is initialized within the component, and if we remove that and move it to where the app is bootstrapped, we'd need to bootstrap it in the mr_widget_options.vue which doesn't use VueX. I believe it uses apollo plus passing in props from a HTML data 5 attribute and GON. It's unnecessary work I think because we are going to remove it in the coming milestone anyway. Also, not having the Vuex module to ship out sooner does not prevent it from renders or impact the other tabs.\n\n## Testing\n\nFrontend engineer to look at associated unit/integration tests affected by change. SET to ensure that any E2E tests are updated accordingly.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-20T18:19:06.767Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:06:41.301Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T14:48:00.041Z","closed_by":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","missed-deliverable","missed:15.2","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},{"id":4708748,"username":"matt_wilson","name":"Matt Wilson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4708748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matt_wilson"}],"author":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363079","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":9,"completed_count":8},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 9 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363079","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363079/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363079/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363079","relative":"#363079","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363079"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8117,"epic":{"id":527340,"iid":8117,"title":"Migrate pipeline tabs' stores to Vuex modules","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8117","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":108888886,"iid":363077,"project_id":278964,"title":"Migrate the Vulnerability Report pipeline tab's Vuex store to a Vuex module","description":"The **Vulnerability Report** pipeline tab Vue app leverages a Vuex store.

That threshold is used to detect long running migrations and abort them.\n\nThe problem is that now that we bumping the tags limit of repo we accept for the migration, we have a highly disparate tags count distribution which in turn create a disparate distribution of pre import execution time.\n\nIf we use a pre import value to low, heavy repositories will get canceled and retried 2 times. Worse, heavy repositories have long pre import steps, like 30 minutes. 3 executions means that we invest 1h30m of Container registry resources for nothing.\n\nIn the long run, a fixed value hurts the migration throughput.\n\n## :fire_engine: Solution\n\n* Use a dynamic pre import:\n   * Apply the fixed threshold, if we are above (long running migration), then:\n   * When considering an image repository, gets the tags count (yes, that's a Container Registry).\n   * Use an application setting that defines the pre_import tags rate.\n   * The pre import timeout will be: \u003ctags count\u003e * \u003cpre_import tags rate\u003e.\n* Use a ~\"feature flag\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-20T14:09:20.763Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T07:03:04.683Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T07:03:04.651Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Container Registry Migration","Container Registry Migration Unplanned","Container Registry Migration::Phase 2","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","package:active","ruby","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363048","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363048","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363048/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/363048/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#363048","relative":"#363048","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#363048"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7316,"epic":{"id":408066,"iid":7316,"title":"Drive the Container Registry migration Phase 2 from Rails","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7316","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":108877156,"iid":363045,"project_id":278964,"title":"Reporter+ role required to view and create internal notes","description":"Plan:Certify\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nLimiting the visibility of internal notes to Reporter and above (and not Authors that don't belong to the project and Guests) gives organizations assurance that information in these notes will only be visible to members of their org.\n\nBy default, [Internal notes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#add-an-internal-note) should not be displayed to `Guest Users` even if they created the issue.

Still, until now, even the stable template used the `latest` tag of the `gl-terraform` wrapper script that provides most of the GitLab integration logic. Changes to this script sometimes caused breaking changes in the `stable` template. The current release fixed the version of the `stable` template to avoid breaking changes outside of major releases.\n\n## The problem\n\nCurrently the terraform-image on `lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml` is a floating version.\n\nAlthough this is convenient to facilitate releases, it's also risky as contributions happen in different repositories and we don't yet have integration testing.\n\nNot being able to lock the version also precludes us from working on breaking changes that could be once implemented for the `latest` terraform template version without breaking the stable ones.\n\nQuoting @tigerwnz :\n\n\u003e the templates in the gitlab repo shouldn't use a floating tag - we already push images such as terraform-images/branches/v0-38-0-1.1 with both TF and gl-terraform versions, we should use something like that (just not under branches)\n\n## Proposal\n\n- On the `terraform-image` repo, we should release versions which include the terraform-image version and not only the terraform version. Those should be released during default branch release pipelines.\n- Then we'd just update them here on the template, and get rid of the floating version.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-20T02:44:12.485Z","updated_at":"2022-09-10T20:17:48.428Z","closed_at":"2022-09-10T20:17:48.405Z","closed_by":{"id":4545061,"username":"nagyv-gitlab","name":"Viktor

Problem\n\n**Primary:** Issues descriptions are edited asynchronously, which can result in conflicted updates when the description is updated by one user while another user is still drafting an edit. The current outcome requires the user to refresh the edit form to proceed. \n\n**Secondary:** When conflicts occur, the user must open the Issue in another window/tab to review the updates.\n\n**Tertiary:** Conflicts can generate two error banners simultaneously, which is unnecessary.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eView current error state\u003c/summary\u003e\n![image](/uploads/d5fc7d23c7781ef753e4aadb798e8a21/image.png)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nUse a single alert to show that the \"Save\" action was captured, why it didn't proceed, and present actions to continue.
