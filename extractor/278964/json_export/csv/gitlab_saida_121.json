[{"id":61446063,"iid":229559,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support user-defined Docker images in SAST for Java (spotbugs)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUser of SAST for Java (spotbugs) should be able to change the Docker image that is used when scanning their project, and use one that provides the dependencies their project needs.\n\n### Intended users\n\n### User experience goal\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Release the analyzer as a Alpine or Debian package\n1. Build the Docker image of the analyzer using this distro package\n1. Change the definition of the scanning job so that it installs the distro package when the analyzer CLI is missing\n1. Come up with a list of supported Docker images, test them, and document them\n\n### Further details\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. Write specs\n- [ ] Looking at the `FORM` instruction of the `Dockerfile`, identify whether the base image is Debian or Alpine\n- [ ] Decide what Docker images will be officially supported; users will be able to use these image in the `image:name` of the scanning job\n- [ ] Among these Docker images, decide which one is used by default\n- [ ] Choose the name of the CI variable that controls the version or URL of the distro package to be fetched by the scanning job\n\n2. Migrate analyzer project:\n\n- [ ] Build a distro package\n  * Extract the commands of the existing `Dockerfile`, and turn them into a `before install` script\n  * Find the exact command line to be used to create the distro package using `fpm`\n  * Update the CI config to add a CI job that creates a distro package using this command line, and export it as a CI artifact; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229561\n- [ ] Build the Docker image using the distro package\n  * Change the `Dockerfile` so that it simply installs the distro package (exported as a CI artifact by a job running in a previous stage) on top of one of the supported Docker images (the \"default\" image); `RUN` and `ENV` commands should be removed\n- [ ] Change the job definition to support user-defined images\n  * Update the CI config to release the distro package when a git tag is created; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229561\n  * In CI template, change the `script` of the scanning job so that it checks if the analyzer CLI is available, and fetches the MAJOR release (like v2) of the distro package if that's not the case, and installs it; it uses [assets links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/links.html#get-a-link) to get the link to the package before downloading it; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_377750483\n  * Update the CI config and add QA jobs to test the analyzer against various base images; these QA jobs force the `image:name` of the scanning job of the test projects they `trigger`, and pass the URL of the temporary distro package built in the pipeline; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_368098558\n- [ ] Update the documentation\n  * Document the ability to change the `image:name` of the scanning job, and list the images that are officially supported; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_375762618\n  * Document how this new feature can be used in offline environment\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe ability to change the `image:name` of a SAST needs to be documented [Overriding SAST jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#overriding-sast-jobs) and/or [SAST Analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers.html).\n\nThe documentation should list the Docker images that are officially supported (images for which compatibility is checked when doing QA). See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_375762618\n\nAlso, the documentation to offline environments should be updated, and give instructions to set up a proxy to serve the distro packages. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_378274578\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nLeverage the `-FREEZE` branches of the existing [test projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests), and force the `image:name` of the scanning job when triggering the downstream pipeline, in the CI configuration of the analyzer project. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_368098558\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers can override the `image:name` of the scanning job, and use a Docker image that provides the dependencies needed to build the scanned project and/or install its dependencies.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo, this is specific to one analyzer project.\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_376358077","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-16T14:50:52.224Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T22:02:11.473Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T22:02:11.459Z","closed_by":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto updated","backend","devops::secure","direction","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThe usage quota \"as of date\" currently shows last occurence of shared minutes usage which is confusing and does not communicate to user/support that a job is successfully running each month to check shared minutes usage. \n\n**Example** - screenshot below taken on 2020-07-23 but notice date is several months ago when shared minutes were used:\n\n![usage_of_CI_minutes](/uploads/063222baa696d4abf480f45c0acf9b54/usage_of_CI_minutes.png)\n(NOTE: this screenshot was taken at user level for illustration only)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to see date of the last job run (i.e., first of the current month) for checking usage even if there were no shared minutes used. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nUpdate date value in `Usage since Mmm dd, yyyy` to reflect last time shared minute usage was reset per month.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes - Yes, please add unit tests to account for new logics/changes for both backend and frontend\n* Integration test changes - Not required\n* End-to-end test change - Not required\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-16T11:49:58.193Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T03:04:28.932Z","closed_at":"2022-04-18T03:04:28.906Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:13.3","priority::3","quad-planning::complete-action","section::ops","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

For starters, the link between the trigger jobs and the child pipelines should be well represented in the pipelines visualization.

Allow click interaction for bridge job referencing other pipelines, and add an element of visual distinction\n\n| Trigger | Destination |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screenshot_2020-07-16_at_3.24.13_PM](/uploads/0fc470b184b3229734e9935b8dacd7f8/Screenshot_2020-07-16_at_3.24.13_PM.png) | ![Screenshot_2020-07-16_at_3.20.08_PM](/uploads/3cbd83c93a4bd29dd0e3cef7176b9229/Screenshot_2020-07-16_at_3.20.08_PM.png) |\n\n3.

I was able to record one instance of this and also recorded the console output and network tab in case there might be something interesting going on there.\n\n![Checking_ability](/uploads/f9ddb78c033bfa1a9a0c606d6fbf329a/Checking_ability.mp4)\n\nThis has now happened at least 2-3 times per day over the last week for me. My browser is Firefox 78.0.2.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI haven't figured out what exactly is triggering it, but it's been happening both for the `gitlab-org/gitlab` project as well as the `gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com` project. Usually it happens when I leave a tab open, work a while on other tabs and then come back to it. On a recent merge request, it also showed up after I switched between \"Changes\" and \"Overview\".\n\n### Example Project\n\nThe most recent MR where I was able to reproduce it on a couple of times was https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/55392.\n\n/cc @andr3 @m_gill","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-15T19:05:33.397Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T14:33:18.008Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T15:24:05.732Z","closed_by":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"labels":["GitLab Premium","SUS::Impacting","UX","UX FY21-Q4","approaching-SLO","customer","devops::create","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-SLO","priority::1","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3688647,"username":"mvanremmerden","name":"Marcel van Remmerden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4f46ed49b87eab9e74f20e0e25b36d0f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mvanremmerden"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":157,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":18,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229352","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229352","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229352/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229352/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#229352","relative":"#229352","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#229352"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3607,"epic":{"id":68969,"iid":3607,"title":"Merge requests UX improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3607","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":59612470,"iid":229351,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo - Node Actions CSS Cleanup Follow-up","description":"## What/Why\n\nFollow up for @peterhegman notes here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/36867#note_380129940\u003cbr /\u003e\nBlocked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1588\n\n## Proposal\n\n1.

\"Total Contributions\" does not always equal the sum of the other columns. Please see below for 2 examples. Their sum is actually 57 and 17 respectively.\n![image](/uploads/058cf59c44914677ad933411dd4ca12c/image.png)\n\n@ahegyi noted this may be a bug. The discrepancy is the number of MRs the user closed (without merge). We do not have a closed MRs column.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHave a user close MRs without merging to see if it affects the \"Total Contributions\" column.\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe Total Contributions column is showing more than the sum of the other columns. This may be occurring because number of MRs the user closed without merging is not showing as a column.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nTotal Contributions column accurately reflects the sum from all the other columns.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee above screenshot.\n\n### Output of checks\n\n(If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-15T15:46:24.140Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T14:54:02.133Z","closed_at":"2022-02-21T14:54:02.112Z","closed_by":{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle Gill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554599/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_gill"},"labels":["devops::manage","feature::enhancement","group::optimize","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"}],"author":{"id":4587928,"username":"cbazan1","name":"Carlos Bazan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2911440d5bc1e7a7e64503059d04f518?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cbazan1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229198","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229198","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229198/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229198/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#229198","relative":"#229198","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#229198"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":59341946,"iid":229188,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add minimum value for wiki page size limit","description":"## Summary\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.\n--\u003e\n\nThe following discussion from !36729 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @alexkalderimis started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/36729#note_378524999):  (+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e Should we add a minimum value for the application setting, which we validate before setting?

This is to ensure that the ZAP scan is able to spider all URLs on the website, and helps ensure results are deterministic.\n\nUnfortunately, some websites have target URLs which cause problems with the check. These include:\n- Websites that take longer than 5 seconds to load\n- Websites that have lots of redirects\n- Websites that return status codes in the range 400-500\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] DAST should continue to scan when the website returns a 400 series error. The error is a client error, which indicates that the server is up and running.\n- [x] DAST should provide an environment variable, `DAST_SKIP_TARGET_CHECK`. When set to `true`, the target check made by DAST should be skipped entirely. `DAST_SKIP_TARGET_CHECK` should be `false` by default.\n- [x] More information should be emitted to explain why the website check failed. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/237842 for a suggestion on how this might look. See also https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/245255 for an explanation on what information would be useful.\n- [x] If the site check fails, the job log should include a message to explain to the user what options they have, for example, \"Set the variable DAST_SKIP_TARGET_CHECK to false to prevent this check\".\n\n### Documentation\n\nPlease document the new environment variable in the DAST documentation.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

Given that we want to deliver these graphs for the Iteration report, I thought it made sense to start by creating this aggregated endpoint for the Iteration report, and then we can backport the refactor into the Milestone graphs.\n\nThere's some discussion here for additional context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213334#note_372510648\n\nThere is a closed WIP MR here that may be helpful as reference: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31713\nBackend Tasks:\n- [x] reuse/refactor milestone burnup chart service code for iteration - (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41280)\n- [x] add Graphql endpoint to fetch iteration burnup/burndown data - (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41666)\n\nDone when:\n\n- [ ] The frontend can request the necessary timeseries data to render Burnup and Burndown charts on the iteration report page.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-14T20:32:24.793Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T19:46:39.400Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T08:31:30.422Z","closed_by":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"labels":["backend","devops::plan","group::project management","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"}],"author":{"id":5965371,"username":"jlear","name":"Jake Lear","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5965371/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jlear"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229046","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":2},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229046","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229046/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/229046/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#229046","relative":"#229046","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#229046"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4009,"epic":{"id":84919,"iid":4009,"title":"progress reporting on iterations","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4009","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":57639624,"iid":229035,"project_id":278964,"title":"Banner notifications when a cleanup policy has failed","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a dev team lead, I want to know which tests take the longest to run, so I can task the team to find efficiencies resulting in safer/faster fixes and reduced runner minutes (saving $$$$).\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to get data about which tests run the slowest in the GitLab UI.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWithin each Job sort the Junit report on the pipeline by status and then time descending. This will surface the slowest tests to the top, but not before failed ones. The first sorted test should be the slowest failed test if there are failures, if there are no failures, the first sorted test should be the slowest passed test.\n\nWe should validate that statuses are sorted in this order:\n\n1. `Errored`\n2. `Failed`\n3. `Passed`\n4. `Skipped`\n\nTrack how often users click on the Reports Tab so we can measure the impact of this change.\n\nThis can be done independently or alongside Sorting by Status (Failed, Skipped, Passed) which is covered by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217514.\n\n![Tests_in_a_job](/uploads/2c3dcf8633bfdb1622e1358d0aa29b30/Tests_in_a_job.png)\n\n#### ~backend \n\nWe need to introduce a sorting mechanism for our [TestSuite](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/test_suite.rb) object. This could be done by 2 options:\n\n1. We sort the data by default once we finish to process a `JUnit` report\n2. We introduce the concept of data ordering for our `TestSuite` object, (similar to what we did for our [attachment feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/projects/pipelines_controller.rb#L275))\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePrevious Proposal\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nAdd a \"See slowest tests\" button to the JUnit report. This will download a .csv of the tests sorted by duration (slowest/longest at the top).\n\nTrack clicks on the button in snowplow so we can measure what % of customers who see the page download the file.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis was discussed in a team Think Big / [Think Small session](https://youtu.be/ZAJwSx5aUVs) as the minimal change to understand if customers value knowing which tests are slowest in their test jobs.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nTBD if we need a docs update.\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Success Measures\n - We will know this feature is successful if the views of the JUnit Test Report has increased by 10% in 30 days after release of the feature on Gitlab.com\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n- Default sort is by status, time and consistent between browsers\n- There is tracking of views of the JUnit report accessible in Sisense\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nThis feature is valuable to the team lead but this is a test so will be available in ~\"GitLab Core\" .\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-14T17:34:46.961Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T13:56:49.674Z","closed_at":"2020-09-14T17:18:37.433Z","closed_by":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","UX","backend","devops::verify","direction","frontend","group::pipeline insights","quad-planning::ready","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"user_notes_count":47,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228950","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/228950","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/228950/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/228950/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#228950","relative":"#228950","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#228950"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":57470671,"iid":228949,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove build_report_summary feature flag","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:build_report_summary` feature flag.\n\nThis feature flag is for toggling performance improvements we have been making on the Test report summary tab on the pipeline page. It is currently behind another feature flag for the test report tab (JUnit reports), so even turning this flag on will have no effect on instances that don't have the JUnit report feature flag on.

There is no visual distinction between these merge request widgets that are blocking the merge request, and other ones that are purely informational, so the user has no way to figure out what exactly is blocking him unless he clearly knows how each of these widgets work, and which ones are actually blocking him.\n- Even though only one thing is blocking the MR, the message says **the items**. This is now adding even more confusion, as the user expects that he has to solve at least two problems.\n\n### Example Project\n\nIf you are a maintainer for the GitLab project, you can have a look at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/36562. \n\n### Proposal\n\nAs MVC, we should add a clearer message what is the actual problem that is blocking the user.

Filter parent project ID and access level\n\nThis is filtering down to documents within the project and also asserting the access level is appropriate to my access of reading issues in this project.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003equery\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```json\n{\n  \"has_parent\": {\n    \"parent_type\": \"project\",\n    \"query\": {\n      \"bool\": {\n        \"should\": [\n          {\n            \"bool\": {\n              \"filter\": [\n                {\n                  \"terms\": {\n                    \"id\": [\n                      278964\n                    ]\n                  }\n                },\n                {\n                  \"terms\": {\n                    \"issues_access_level\": [\n                      20,\n                      10\n                    ]\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n},\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### 2. Searching in the parent group (I think)\n\nThis is redundant since we've already filtered down to a single project but it seems the below query is being added in error to also filter to docs that live in the parent group as either public docs or with visibility matching my access level for each project.\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eQuery\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bool\": {\n    \"should\": [\n      {\n        \"term\": {\n          \"confidential\": false\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"bool\": {\n          \"must\": [\n            {\n              \"term\": {\n                \"confidential\": true\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"bool\": {\n                \"should\": [\n                  {\n                    \"term\": {\n                      \"author_id\": 120073\n                    }\n                  },\n                  {\n                    \"term\": {\n                      \"assignee_id\": 120073\n                    }\n                  },\n                  {\n                    \"terms\": {\n                      \"project_id\": [\n                        7764,\n                        8146,\n                        13083,\n\n                        ...

If we do that we'll then no longer need to use the parent join but can just use `rid` directly.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nI benchmarked a few iterations on this query removing redundant parts piece by

\u003e50% if all we do is remove the redundant part of the query. Then we'll make a further small improvement if we can remove the use of join and just use the `rid` field. Removing the highlighting doesn't improve anything so doesn't need to be a focus for this issue.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-14T07:25:35.104Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:36:16.877Z","closed_at":"2020-08-07T08:10:44.031Z","closed_by":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry
