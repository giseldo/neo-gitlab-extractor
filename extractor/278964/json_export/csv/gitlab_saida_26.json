previously used LDAP, so their user accounts have ldap identities connected to them. They are no longer using LDAP (`gitlab_rails['ldap_enabled'] = false`) and rely on SAML for login. This worked fine before upgrading to 14.9.2, after which users no longer could login, getting a HTTP 500 error from GitLab after being redirected from the ADFS provider.\n\nAfter removing the unused LDAP idenity from a user account, this user was then able to successfully login again.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n1. Use LDAP, have GitLab user accounts associated with LDAP identities\n2. Disable LDAP integration\n3. Use SAML for login, experience no issues\n4. Upgrade to GitLab 14.9.2\n5. Attempt to login using SAML\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUser gets HTTP 500 from GitLab after the redirect back to GitLab.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUser is successfully logged in.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nHere is the entire stack trace:\n\n```\nCompleted 500 Internal Server Error in 176ms (ActiveRecord: 80.3ms | Elasticsearch: 0.0ms | Allocations: 36426)\n\nGitlab::Auth::Ldap::Config::InvalidProvider (Unknown provider (ldapmain).

It says:\n\n\u003e These API calls allow you to read and modify GitLab instance application settings as they appear in `/admin/application_settings/general`.\n\nThis can be interpreted as, the schema is bound to the UI, and it can be changed without notice if the UI changes. However, it is not saying this explicitly.\n\nWe want to change the description to clearly indicate that the schema for this endpoint is not fixed and can be changed at any time. This needs to be considered to be a ~\"breaking change\" so it needs to be announced two milestones ahead and can only be done in a major release.\n\n\u003c!--\nThis should contain a brief description of the feature or functionality that is deprecated. The description should clearly state the potential impact of the deprecation to end users.\n\nIt is recommended that you link to the documentation.\n\nThe description of the deprecation should state what actions the user should take to rectify the behavior. If the deprecation is scheduled for an upcoming release, the content should remain in the deprecations documentation page until it has been completed. For example, if a deprecation is announced in 14.9 and scheduled to be completed in 15.0, the same content would be included in the documentation for 14.9, 14.10, and 15.0.\n--\u003e\n\n### Breaking Change\n\nPlease consider the API schema described in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/settings as flexible.

in net/http affects webhooks: Sidekiq job stuck at 100% CPU for a year","description":"**[HackerOne report #1531958](https://hackerone.com/reports/1531958)** by `afewgoats` on 2022-04-06, assigned to `GitLab Team`:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nA Gitlab webhook may be pointed at a malicious webhook receiver.  \nThe webhook receiver can respond with a specially crafted long header.  \nGitlab processes the header with Ruby's net/http where there is a regular expression operation with quadratic complexity (ReDoS).  \nThis causes the `web_hook` Sidekiq job to get stuck at 100% CPU utilisation until the regular expression processing is complete (weeks later).  \nThe long headers are also kept in memory and the connection can be kept open.\n\n######  Comparison to 1252116\n\nIn report #1252116, the impact was that the network connection was kept open indefinitely, potentially causing connection pool and memory exhaustion. This new report is instead about CPU exhaustion for a more serious and more powerful DoS. It also bypasses the timeout added to fix #1252116 (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/a8807ee52d0b22b68beb31f0cad6ad5b77b4caf6) (deployed in 14.9.2) as the timeout only gets hit once the regular expression has finished processing (timeout is checked between header lines).\n\n######  The root cause\n\nA Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in Ruby's net/http affects Gitlab webhooks.\n\nThe bug is in [net/http/response.rb#57](https://github.com/ruby/net-http/blob/7b852b1feb7c1c0bc3019687d6ee5c385ce26eb9/lib/net/http/response.rb#L57) when reading headers line by line:\n\n```rb  \nline = sock.readuntil(\"\\n\", true).sub(/\\s+\\z/, '')  \n```\n\nThe `sub` regex is the issue. While it looks safe and linear, the `sub` operation will actually have quadratic complexity as there is no starting anchor.\n\nA header line which contains many consecutive spaces but *does not end in a space*, such as\n\n```rb  \n( \"a\" + \" \" * 950000 + \"b\" ).sub(/\\s+\\z/, '')  \n```\n\nwill exhibit extreme backtracking.\n\nThe time complexity is quadratic with respect to the number of spaces in the string (doubling the number of spaces quadruples the processing time). Approximate timings from my laptop (I measured until 10,000 and then extrapolated):\n\n```  \n|  Spaces  |  Seconds   |  Hours   |  Days  |  \n|----------|------------|----------|--------|  \n|     2000 |        1.8 |          |        |  \n|     4000 |        7.2 |          |        |  \n|     8000 |       28.6 |          |        |  \n|    10000 |       44.7 |          |        |  \n|   100000 |     4473.0 |     1.24 |   0.05 |  \n|  1000000 |   447300.0 |   124.25 |   5.18 |  \n| 10000000 | 44730000.0 | 12425.00 | 517.71 |  \n```\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run the attached malicious node server on port 3000: `node ./net-http-response.js`  \n2. Create a project and add webhooks for issue events to http://maliciousserver:3000/xyz.  \n3. (If you hosted the malicious server on your local network, you will need to \"Allow requests to the local network from web hooks and services\" in /admin/application_settings/network.)  \n4. Create an issue (or close or reopen one) to trigger the webhook. Gitlab will make a webhook request.  \n5. The malicious server will respond with `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and then a header line with 9,500,000 consecutive spaces in the middle.  \n6. The `web_hook` Sidekiq job will be stuck processing at 100% CPU and will not complete for **over a year**. This can be seen in the Background Jobs panel (/admin/background_jobs) and `top`:\n\n![gitlab-high-cpu-header-regex-dos.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/a803f0d6-0dbb-4454-b7be-ab901b463fc6/gitlab-high-cpu-header-regex-dos.png)\n\n![gitlab-header-regex-dos-sidekiq-background_jobs.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c5d05bc9-f813-4c27-b4b5-9407821ef281/gitlab-header-regex-dos-sidekiq-background_jobs.png)\n\nThe ReDoS triggers on web requests made to Gitlab which trigger an external request e.g. validating the URL before repository import. However, in these cases a `RequestTimeoutException` triggers after 60 seconds of 100% CPU.\n\nThe regex runs without a timeout on project webhooks. It's not just project webhooks though. Any use of `Gitlab::HTTP.post` such as system webhooks and integrations (e.g. Mattermost) are affected.\n\nTo demonstrate the net/http bug:\n\n```rb  \nrequire 'net/http'  \nuri = URI('http://maliciousserver:3000/x')  \nNet::HTTP.get(uri)  \n```\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitlab webhooks and system hooks get stuck for years in a CPU intensive regular expression operation when receiving a malicious header from an external service.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nProcessing a webhook response should never take longer than a year. More strictly, it should obey the webhook read timeout and also not run at 100% CPU.\n\nRuby should simply use `sock.readuntil(\"\\n\", true).rstrip` instead of a regex as I think it does the same thing. I can make a PR / issue for ruby unless you want to do it yourselves - let me know if and how you want me to proceed.\n\nPotentially drop responses with very long header lines.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nnet/http is called by httparty which is called by  \n```  \n\"lib/gitlab/http.rb:57:in `perform_request'\",\"app/services/web_hook_service.rb:125:in `make_request'\"  \n```\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThe bug happens locally. I did not test this on Gitlab.com because I'm sure it will affect it.\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:  \n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\nRunning in docker\n\n```  \nSystem information  \nSystem:  \nProxy:          no  \nCurrent User:   git  \nUsing RVM:      no  \nRuby Version:   2.7.5p203

intensive Sidekiq job runs forever (ok, not forever, but over a year) wasting energy and slowing down the system.  \nAlso possible to get connection pool exhaustion by sending data slowly and keeping the socket open until the regex completes (bypassing fix for #1252116) for multiple webhook connections.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise

However, we currently only support the ability to send data to an HTTP destination. This means users must write custom logic to receive, process, and then re-send the events. This is very difficult because our current documentation does not describe the structure and type of data that will be sent through Streaming Audit Events.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n- Update the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html) to describe the schema that streaming audit events will be delivered as.\n- Note: New pages can be added to the docs for this, it doesn't have to all be on the linked page.\n- Provide JSONSchema file with validated output.

table or create new table to keep dedicated set of settings. I identified some columns that in my opinion are good candidates for moving. I did a quick research on each - it does not mean I'm 100% confident that the move will be easy :(.\n\nSome of the columns, for example description-related columns, because of how wide they are - moving them will benefit performance and make this table less busy.\n\nRight now, this is particularly visible while using 'GroupFinder' - every call to this class is loading all 49 columns of namespaces table.\n\n\nColumns to migrate (separate MRs per attribute):  \n- [ ] description\n- [ ] description_html\n- [ ] cached_markdown_version\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. **Create the column in the `namespace_settings` table.**\n1. **Setup ActiveRecord callback to keep the value up to date between `namespace` and `namespace_settings`**\n1. **Add a special index that allows iterating over the records. (`create index i1 on namespace (id) where your_field is not null`)**\n1. Implement and trigger background migration.\n1. Release N+1: Update the backend to persist the column only in the `namespace_settings` table.\n1. Release N+1: Ignore the column in the `namespace` table.\n1. Release N+2: Remove the column from `namespace` following our [DB guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/migration_style_guide.html#example-add-a-column-my_column-to-the-users-table).\n\n## Availability and Testing\n- Run `package-and-qa` job and

[L103](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f6a703c/app/models/integrations/prometheus.rb#L103).\n\nSo when we test the connection [L96](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f6a703c/app/models/integrations/prometheus.rb#L96), it fails with a `NoMethodError`.\n\n### Implementation Guide\n\nThere are two options:\n1. Return an object that implements the `ping` method, following the [Null Object Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern).\n2. Include `NoMethodError` in the rescue or catch a more generic error, like `StandardError` to include this possible error.\n\nWhen a user hits Test integration for Prometheus, occasionally this issue occurs.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

This is happening in the [`GitlabSubscriptions::NotifySeatsExceededWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e4080de6935228a4677a4327acee9e5cf551c2a3/ee/app/workers/gitlab_subscriptions/notify_seats_exceeded_worker.rb). Only ~100 of these requests actually result in an email being sent to the group owners.\n\nThis many network requests and jobs may impact performance or delay other jobs.\n\nThis problem lead to the Sidekiq queues in CustomersDot getting inundated with jobs, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4934+.  In particular, we saw that one namespace had thousands of jobs and continued to enqueue more every few seconds.  We put in a few quick fix (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5581) to prevent requests for this namespace from enqueuing more `Reconciliations::SendSeatOverageNotificationJob`.  We also added a [CDot feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/165/edit), `block_seat_overage_notification`, to easily enable this blocking logic.  Once this issue is resolved, we should be able to roll back this logic in CDot and remove the feature flag as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4948.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe should flag the groups that have recently exceeded their purchased seat allowance and use a scheduled job to send this information to CustomersDot in batches, rather than individually.\n\nA potential solution would be:\n\n- [x] Create a `Subscription#max_seats_used_changed_at` field, with an index **(being implemented in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84913)**\n- [x] Update the [`UpdateMaxSeatsUsedForGitlabComSubscriptionsWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b7a551597d2f6ac592465146b5ad7b8008c2ad0a/ee/app/workers/update_max_seats_used_for_gitlab_com_subscriptions_worker.rb) and the GitlabSubscription model callbacks to update the new field when the `max_seats_used` value changes **(being implemented in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84913)**\n- [x] Update [subscription renewal process on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b7a551597d2f6ac592465146b5ad7b8008c2ad0a/ee/app/models/gitlab_subscription.rb) to reset the new column **(being implemented in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84913)**\n- [x] Update the [CustomersDot GraphQL endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3c5bd59e327eb1f1722e78cb725f0410aa6be120/app/graphql/mutations/emails/send_seat_overage_notification.rb#L23) to support batches of notifications https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5677\n- [x] Create a scheduled job that looks for all active subscriptions that have `max_seats_used_changed_at` in the last 24 (or 48?) hours set and batch send these to CustomersDot\n   - Add index on the `max_seats_used_changed_at` column to support this query\n- [x] Stop responding to [the event from the member creation service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/020ac9a48e93fa7be6a7e07e10013a8e5bd4ccc0/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/event_store.rb#L26)\n\n**Note:** a more in-depth discussion around this issue started here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348487#note_900886862 if more context is needed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-06T23:20:44.116Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T20:48:36.365Z","closed_at":"2022-12-27T20:51:29.561Z","closed_by":{"id":3614911,"username":"rcobb","name":"Ryan Cobb","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7047b7014264f07daf9836e55fc5ef4c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rcobb"},"labels":["Track Health Status","[deprecated] Category:Billing and Subscription Management","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::billing and subscription management","maintenance::performance","missed:15.6","missed:15.7","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":3614911,"username":"rcobb","name":"Ryan Cobb","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7047b7014264f07daf9836e55fc5ef4c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rcobb"}],"author":{"id":4981524,"username":"jhyson","name":"Josianne Hyson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4981524/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jhyson"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614911,"username":"rcobb","name":"Ryan Cobb","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7047b7014264f07daf9836e55fc5ef4c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rcobb"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358080","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358080","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358080/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358080/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#358080","relative":"#358080","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#358080"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7230,"epic":{"id":401187,"iid":7230,"title":"[QSR] [SaaS] Create transparency about User Overage process at the time of adding users","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7230","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":106622821,"iid":359054,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add config files to the new events","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

lifecycle management for Advanced Search indices","description":"## Problem\n\nAs GitLab scales, so do the size of individual shards within Advanced Search indexes and the indexes themselves. Currently, our maintenance of this problem includes:\n\n1. Create new index with more primary shards\n2. Pause indexing\n3. Reindex data from old index to new index\n4. Point alias to new index\n5. Resume indexing\n\nThe manual intervention does not scale **AND** it does not help self managed instances with shard size imbalance.\n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate a scalable automated solution to handle shards becoming too big. This will keep all of our indexes around the same size with the same number of shards which would make capacity planning more predictable as the system scales. \n\nWe can create an [Index Lifecycle Management Policy (ILM policy)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html) for segments based on `namespace_id`. This will include:\n\n* Create all policies using Advanced Search Migrations to push changes out the self managed users\n* Use read and write aliases\n* Documents move to cold phase after X number of days (updated?)\n* Each “segment” would have its own ILM - segments are data types (projects, issues, notes, etc.)\n* Example\n  * index name: projects_80_0001, projects_80_0002\n  * Write alias: projects_80_write\n  * Read alias: projects_80_read\n  * Global search: projects_*\n  * Group search: \u003cnamespace_id\u003e % \u003cnumber_of_indices\u003e = \u003cindex_alias_name\u003e\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    R{Sharded Read} --\u003e A1(alias: issues-1)\n    R --\u003e A2(alias: issues-2)\n    A1 --\u003e |ILM| I1(index: issues-1-1)\n    A1 --\u003e |ILM| I2(index: issues-1-2)\n    A2 --\u003e |ILM| I3(index: issues-2-1)\n    A2 --\u003e |ILM| I4(index: issues-2-2)\n    GR(alias: issues) --\u003e I1\n    GR --\u003e I2\n    GR --\u003e I3\n    GR --\u003e I4\n    RR{Sharded Write} --\u003e AA1(alias: issues-1)\n    RR --\u003e AA2(alias: issues-2)\n    AA1 -.-\u003e II1(index: issues-1-1)\n    AA1 --\u003e II2(index: issues-1-2)\n    AA2 -.-\u003e II3(index: issues-2-1)\n    AA2 --\u003e II4(index: issues-2-2)\n\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-06T12:54:59.171Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T14:58:53.644Z","closed_at":"2022-09-06T14:58:53.308Z","closed_by":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","auto updated","devops::data_stores","feature::enhancement","group::global search","section::enablement","type::feature","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

connect verify context-qsh in JiraConnect::InstallationsController","description":"This is a follow-up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83836#note_901376025\n\nWe currently only verify the JWT qsh claim in

I checked the other controllers in the JiraConnect namespace and came to the conclusion that we should verify qsh claims in [`JiraConnect::InstallationsController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a9bc2aa908049e8114880209e6e86925ff209705/app/controllers/jira_connect/installations_controller.rb) too.\n\nHere is why the other controllers don't need to verify qsh:\n\n- [`JiraConnect::AppDescriptorController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a9bc2aa908049e8114880209e6e86925ff209705/app/controllers/jira_connect/app_descriptor_controller.rb) this controller renders the [app descriptor ](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor/) and should be publicly available. So no `qsh` verification needed.\n- [`JiraConnect::EventsController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a9bc2aa908049e8114880209e6e86925ff209705/app/controllers/jira_connect/events_controller.rb) this is the controller that handles [lifecycle endpoints](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor/#lifecycle).

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nDependency Scanning now switches to FIPS-enabled images automatically when running on FIPS compliant GitLab Runner. Users no longer need to set the CI variable `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX` to use FIPS-enabled images of Dependency Scanning, and they can now remove this variable from CI configurations.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDependency Scanning CI jobs executed on [FIPS compliant GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/#fips-compliant-gitlab-runner) should automatically use [FIPS-enabled Docker images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#fips-enabled-images). Users shouldn't need to set CI variables to explicit use these images.\n\n### Proposal\n\nLeverage the [predefined CI variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) `CI_GITLAB_FIPS_MODE` to automatically switch to FIPS-enabled images when the scanning job is running on a FIPS compliant GitLab Runner.\n\nTechnically, a solution is to add a rule to all Gemnasium jobs:\n- `gemnasium-dependency_scanning`\n- `gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning`\n- `gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning`\n\nThe additional is the same as the existing one but:\n- It has an extra condition to be triggered when `CI_GITLAB_FIPS_MODE` is true.\n- It sets `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX` to `-fips`.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357922#note_916752164\n\nThere are no FIPS-enabled images for `bundler-audit` and `retire.js`, but we assume that `bundler-audit-dependency_scanning` and `retire.js-dependency_scanning` are removed from the CI template in %\"15.0\".\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

summary","description":"\n### Problem to solve\n\nDAST browser-based scans include a summary of the evidence in a finding so that users can verify whether or not the finding is a false-positive.\n\nThe summary of a finding is made up of all matched values in the vulnerability check. This can lead to summaries that contain content that is not relevant to the finding, and hamper a user's ability to determine whether or not the finding is an FP.\n\n### Examples\n\nSome example summaries for checks:\n\n- `614.1` summary `\"cwe_session_id=********; Domain=dast-cwe-checks; Expires=1969-12-31 23:59:59 +0000 UTC; Path=/ cwe_user_id=********; Domain=dast-cwe-checks; Expires=1969-12-31 23:59:59 +0000 UTC; Path=/ https://dast-cwe-checks:8090/auth\"`. This contains two cookies and a URL. It is hard for the user to know which cookie is related to the finding, and the URL provides no extra information.\n- `16.1` summary `\"\"`. No summary is not useful.\n- `16.2` summary `server`. Not showing what the `server` information contains means the user can't determine if the finding is an FP or not.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSummary could be built using the same templating logic that is used in report uniqueness templates (which are used to detect duplicate findings).\n\nFor example, a summary for `16.2` could have the template `request header '{request-header:name}' has value '{request_header:value}'`, which would render on the finding as `request header 'server' has value 'nginx 1.2.1'`.\n\nIt's assumed in the above example that `request_header` is the name of a matcher that defined in the `16.2` yaml file.\n\n### Implementation\n\n- [ ] Add `summary` to the passive check DAST CWE schema\n- [ ] Define summary for each DAST CWE passive check\n- [ ] Parse the summary in Browserker, and build a model similar to the uniqueness template\n- [ ] The uniqueness template and summary in Browserker should be related\n  - If the uniqueness template returns two instances, then there should be two instances of the summary\n  - If this is not possible, an error should be raised (implies that the YAML file is incorrect)\n- [ ] Render the summary into the evidence field\n- [ ] Aggregated findings should combine summaries\n  - At the moment, the summary of the aggregated finding is the first finding's summary. This will hide information.\n  - Join summaries that are unique from all findings\n  - If required, we can make this a separate issue\n- [x] ~~Keep in mind: the same may need to happen to `description` of a finding in future~~ Cam: Suggest we don't keep this mind, we can worry about it in future.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] [Generalize UniqueBy to represent templates

Previously, the operation did a simple `du -sk` on the `.git` directory. While this was efficient and technically gives us the physical disk usage of each repository, it's not accurate from the perspective that the **way** we store the repository eg: repack or not repacked can cause the size to vary greatly. (see discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351415)\n\nFor this reason, `GetRepositorySize` now uses (behind a feature flag) a git operation `git rev-list --all --objects --disk-usage` to get the usage of all objects in the git object database. This ends up giving a much more consistent number that more accurately represents the usage of the repository from a user's point of view.\n\n## Remaining Effort\n\nWith this update in place, the issue with this method is that it's much slower than `du -sk`, since it does a full graph walk through the entire object database. On large repositories, this can take several seconds or longer.\n\nWe don't want this to impact project page loads. Already in Rails, the call to `GetRepositorySize` is cached and stored in a `project_statistics` table. \n\nWith this new slower but more accurate method of calculating sizes, we need to make sure that the UI never calls `GetRepositorySize` directly, but instead always gets its value from the `project_statistics` table. In addition to this, we want to minimize the number of times this gets called and limit it to only get called after housekeeping runs for a repository, rather than calling it on every push.\n\nTo update the size after each push, instead of calling `GetRepositorySize`, we can do this incrementally in `Gitlab::GitAccess` since we already check the size of the quarantine directory to see if the push will burst the size limit. We can update the statistics table when we do this check.\n\nThen, after each time housekeeping is called on a repository, we can call `ProjectCacheWorker` to update the repo size. This way we limit the expensive `GetRepositorySize` call to only when we do housekeeping.\n\nTo provide clarity for the rest of the effort associated with this issue, the following discrete updates are needed.\n\n- [x] call `ProjectCacheWorker` to update the statistics table after housekeeping is run.\n\n- [x] Ensure that Rails does not call `GetRepositorySize` directly, but instead reads repository size from the `project_statistics` table (which will have the cached value).\n\n- [x] Do not include internal refs eg: refs/merge-requests, refs/keep-around etc. in the repository size calculation\n\n- [x] Exclude RepositorySize from Gitaly appdex calculation, as the latency will go way up due to git-rev-list(1)\n\n- [x] Add an endpoint for the UI to call for on demand repository size recalculation\n\n- [x] Add a button to recalculate repository size\n\n- [ ] Remove the feature flag around the updated grpc once we know it's not being called except during a `ProjectCacheWorker` call due to performance concerns.\n\n## Button in Usage Quotas\n\nIntroduce a \"Recalculate repository usage\" button on the `Settings \u003e Usage Quotas` page.\n\n- Button placed on Usage Quotas page\n- Clicking on the button will trigger the function GetRepositorySize\n    - Feedback to the user will be in the form of an informational alert (blue)\n    - Alert title: `Repository size recalculation started`\n    - Alert content: `Refresh page in a few minutes to view usage.` \n\n| Usage Quotas with button | Usage Quotas with alert |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|

requests.\n\n\n## How to assign urgency\n\n\nThe process is described [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html) but for convenience I have added 99.8/99.5 percentiles, count (past 7 days) and the endpoints to the above table from [kibana](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/visualize#/edit/474fdd60-b127-11ec-afaf-2bca15dfbf33?_g=(filters%3A!()%2CrefreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!t%2Cvalue%3A0)%2Ctime%3A(from%3Anow-7d%2Cto%3Anow))).\n\nWe need to set urgencies to all the above endpoints. For **API requests**, check the values under **99.5th** percentile column and for **web requests** check the values under **99.8th** percentile column to see how the endpoint is performing. [This table](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#how-to-adjust-the-urgency) has the available urgencies.\n\nIdeally, the endpoint with higher request count should have higher urgency but some endpoints like `GET /api/:version/projects/:id` might not be performing optimally so we need to create or find an existing performance issue for the endpoint \u0026 add it to [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7832) to track all such issues. We can then set a lower urgency temporarily and link the issue inside the code.\n If the endpoint is performing optimally we can set a higher urgency. For instance, `GET /api/:version/users/:id` can be set to `medium` urgency.\n\nThe endpoints with lower number of requests should be set to `default` or can even be set to `low` urgency if there are only few thousands requests and the percentile duration is greater than default.\n\n### Sample MR for

`master`, in a follow-up, it should be possible change [`Integration#api_field_names`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/bcb79d53fd54e545cf80416beb77360e06262c22/app/models/integration.rb#L478) to:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e

Testing\n\nWe have tests around this behavior at the [unit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/models/integration_spec.rb#L755) and [request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/requests/api/integrations_spec.rb#L381) layer\n\nThese tests should be great to support this effort, and assert that no sensitive fields will leak through.\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

The Enqueuer picks up the next abort migration, the above repo in this case.\n1. The Enqueuer will [try](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c6d9e7146515853145011beef69bcef21ca4a0d5/app/models/container_repository.rb#L288) to reconcile the status but will end up [doing nothing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c6d9e7146515853145011beef69bcef21ca4a0d5/app/models/container_repository.rb#L298-299).\n1. The Enqueuer ends.\n1. If capacity allows, it re enqueuer a job = go back to (1.)\n\n## :fire_engine: Solution\n\nThe Enqueuer should not be doing if during status reconcile, the received status are `import_in_progress pre_import_in_progress pre_import_canceled import_canceled`. That already [implemented](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c6d9e7146515853145011beef69bcef21ca4a0d5/app/models/container_repository.rb#L19).\n\nHaving said that, we should check for state coherence. Eg. if we have `pre_import_in_progress`, we should leave the image repository on the Rails side in `pre_importing`.\n\nTricky part: we need to update the migration status on the Rails side _without_ the side effects of calling the Container Registry. For example, forcing `pre_importing` should not all the Container Registry to start the pre import. We might need to use `#update_columns`.\n\nThis way, the Enqueuer will fix the status coherence (eg. same status on the Rails and Containe Registry side) which helps with:\n* current capacity accuracy.\n* the next Enqueuer jobs will pick it up again.\n* the Guard worker will detect long running migrations and process them properly.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-04T12:41:35.896Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T09:31:33.536Z","closed_at":"2022-04-07T09:31:33.504Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Container Registry Migration","Container Registry Migration Blocker","Container Registry Migration Unplanned","Container Registry Migration::Phase 2","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","package:active","ruby","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357670","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/357670","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/357670/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/357670/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#357670","relative":"#357670","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#357670"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7316,"epic":{"id":408066,"iid":7316,"title":"Drive the Container Registry migration Phase 2 from Rails","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7316","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":106027884,"iid":357664,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Enable ci_safe_artifact_content_type","description":"\n\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout a change in our public API for our [artifact raw endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ecd79f912a710f3a027a064ebd7bbc3c06f5e7d0/lib/api/ci/job_artifacts.rb#L50-64) which will serving artifact with the `content-type` set to `text/plain`.\n\nThis is currently behind the `ci_safe_artifact_content_type` feature flag introduced in \u003chttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83826\u003e.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::sharding\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline_insights`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @morefice\n- PM: @jreporter\n- Manager: @shampton \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect to render an empty state as you can see on [this design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296963/designs/Pipelines-Test-Details.png).\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\n\u003c!-- What are the settings we need to configure in order to have this feature viable? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- \nExample below:\n \n1.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_safe_artifact_content_type`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_safe_artifact_content_type` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_safe_artifact_content_type --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_safe_artifact_content_type --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_safe_artifact_content_type`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_safe_artifact_content_type false\n```\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\nCodeblock formatting works for common languages like JavaScript for example. The language type for a codeblock is declared in Markdown after the 3 backticks like below:\n\n```\n```javascript\n```\n\nThere are also other types that exists for a codeblock but there is no formal syntax formatting for it. An example of this is [nomnoml for UML diagrams](https://nomnoml.com/).\n```\n```nomnoml\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\nWith the Content Editor we would want to allow users to specific codeblocks types without needing to go to the raw Markdown source to make this edit.\n\n- Display custom type beginning used\n- Display option for action of creating a new custom type\n- Entering a custom type in a text input\n\n| Custom type in list with action to create custom type | Creating a custom type |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/675af682af2e135367c9cbaa52d00909/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/a4eeebb14fd2fdd6ec05124b19a80b40/image.png) |\n\n### Questions\n\n1. What should we do when the user specifies a language that already exists? Are we able to have \"Did you mean X?\" or have an autocomplete as they enter the custom label? The rationale here is that it our library may already support that type but they forgot to search for it prior to creating a custom label.\n    - **Answer:** If a user types a language that already exists, we select that from the dropdown when the user clicks \"Apply\". Otherwise we show Custom (language_type) in the dropdown. Unlike labels, we're not really creating something duplicate here. Anything custom that the user enters doesn't create a new entry in the dropdown list, it just shows in the dropdown title\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\n### Intended users\n\n Who will use this feature?

Those unresolved issues are captured in this epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7763\n\nFor now, so we don't block rolling out the MR widget extension rollout, we introduce a secondary feature flag.\n\nThe new feature flag is `refactorLicenseComplianceExtension`. \n\n## Feature flag notes\n\nIn order for the LicenseCompliance MR widget extension to show instead of the old one both `refactorMrWidgetsExtensions` and `refactorLicenseComplianceExtension` must be enabled.\n\nOtherwise it will show the legacy widget alongside the new ones.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/mr_widget_options.vue` add `shouldShowLicenseComplianceExtension` computed prop to contain flag logic\n\n- Update `registerLicenseCompliance()` method in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/mr_widget_options.vue` to use `shouldShowLicenseComplianceExtension` computed prop to determine whether or not to register new mr widget extension for license compliance\n\n- Update vue template logic in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/mr_widget_options.vue` to use new `shouldShowLicenseComplianceExtension` computed prop\n\n- Push new frontend feature flag from controller in `ee/app/controllers/ee/projects/merge_requests_controller.rb`\n\n- Stub new feature flag in `ee/spec/features/merge_request/user_sees_status_checks_widget_spec.rb`\n\n- Add new YAML file for feature flag as

documentation:\n\n- Discovering relevant documentation.\n- Navigating between relevant documentation pages.\n- Documentation that laid out the overall concepts and choices.\n\nThe GitLab Developer Portal https://developer.gitlab.com would have been the perfect resource for them had they discovered it, but it lacks discoverability. (Additionally, very few of the ~\"group::integrations\" team themselves were aware of this resource until diving into this organisation's pain points.)\n\nThe GitLab Developer Portal should be linked from the main GitLab footer on https://about.gitlab.com so it is a discoverable resource.

This is especially critical if we're dealing with missing final import completion notifications, we a repository is kept in read-only mode during a final import.\n\nWe need a way to monitor this specific event and alert us if the count of \"stalled\" (at least from the Rails perspective) migrations goes above a given threshold and/or keep above if for longer than a given amount of time.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Prometheus\n\nCreate two new row count metrics on top of the Rails `container_repositories` database table, one for counting potentially stalled pre-imports and another for final imports. This requires a change in `gitlab-exporter` and `chef-repo`, similar to what was done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356286, which will take care of generating the respective Prometheus metrics.\n\n### Grafana\n\nWe should then add a graph for the resulting metrics to the registry migration dashboard in Grafana (similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/merge_requests/4482).\n\n### Alerts (Slack and ~\"severity::4\" incident)\n\nFinally, we should create an alert in the `runbooks` project so that if each count goes above `N` for longer than `Y` we'll get a notification on Slack ([#alerts](https://gitlab.slack.com/channels/alerts) and [#feed_alerts-general](https://gitlab.slack.com/channels/alerts-general) channels) and an S4 incident is automatically created for investigation.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/monitoring/alerts_manual.md for instructions.\n\nHere is a _very_ similar example:

Gather all migrations in final states (`import_done`, `pre_import_done`, `import_aborted`).\n1. Take the most recent `X_done_at` timestamps and use that as the last activity.\n1. Use the delay between `Time.zone.now` and the timestamp in (2.).\n\nThe problem is that due to bugs, the related timestamps could be missing. If this [statement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/0558447ca45a850a96abcd637ea576caf92ffb60/app/workers/container_registry/migration/enqueuer_worker.rb#L83) is evaluated with a `nil` value, it will always return false = the job will be never allowed to run.\n\n## :fire_engine: Solution\n\nI think we should update the logic around the waiting time enforcement with:\n\n* Additionally consider `import_skipped` with the related timestamp `migration_skipped_at`\n* Make sure that all `before_transition` for each considered state that set the related timestamp uses `any` as the starting state.\n   * Example of [one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/0558447ca45a850a96abcd637ea576caf92ffb60/app/models/container_repository.rb#L162) that need an update\n* Add a

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357385) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_create_code-review`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set uncached_mr_attention_requests_count 25 --actors`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set uncached_mr_attention_requests_count 50 --actors`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set uncached_mr_attention_requests_count 75 --actors`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set uncached_mr_attention_requests_count 100 --actors`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set uncached_mr_attention_requests_count true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357385) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `uncached_mr_attention_requests_count` feature flag.

This would allow diff output on failure and also make it easy to identify when testing isn't deterministic in some way.\n\nTo be prepared for parallel speed work the list should be sorted.\n\nThere are several places we use count:\n\n1. [x] The quick integration jobs in `.gitlab-ci.yml` which use `checkreportfaultcount.sh`. - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/api-fuzzing-src/-/merge_requests/671\n1. [x] The worker-entry tests - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/api-fuzzing-src/-/merge_requests/672\n1. ~[ ] Tests that use `checklastjob.py`~ - These tests are not used and may be removed in the future\n1.
