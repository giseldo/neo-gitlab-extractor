In that issue, we released the ability to collapse board lists in order to view more lists on the screen at one time. However, the collapsed list state was not saved, meaning every time a user returned to the board, they would have to re-collapse lists.\n\nThis issue saves the collapsed lists preferences to the back end for each user, providing a quality of life improvement in that your board views will now be saved for your user.\n\nEvery single list in the GitLab instance has a unique state per user.\n\ngitlab-ce~9594407 because of same reason as in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40630.\n\n---\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/code_quality.html using instruction for latest gitlab-ee stable release 11.3.4-ee.\r\n\r\n*  Add a code_quality job as explained in the documentation\r\n*  Run the job\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\r\n\r\nThe job run until there is no space left on the disk. When I started to run the job, 10 go were available.\r\nThen the job processed during 20 minutes and didn't stop to write datas on the disk.\r\nIn addition, there were not a lot of code to analyze.\r\n\r\nAs [noted by users](#8008) the Docker in Docker container used by Code Quality can take up quite a bit of disk space and the resulting report can fill a disk as well. The minimum runner requirements to use this functionality aren't documented in the [feature documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html).\r\n\r\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\r\n\r\n* The job should write the report without take so much space.\r\n* If the job runs out of memory a more graceful exit and/or helpful error message would be nice so users can troubleshoot.\r\n* [Sasha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) and [Devon](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer) should know the runner requirements needed to utilize the code quality feature so they can right size their setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](/uploads/8d6f77f5d699e612e98788a89331ec60/image.png)\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nThe documentation for the Code Quality feature should call out the size of the DinD container and/or provide some guidance and/or examples of the disk size needed to utilize the feature. Reference the work done in (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39998) for examples.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-15T20:59:16.401Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T13:53:06.404Z","closed_at":"2020-04-15T03:15:17.930Z","closed_by":{"id":4155490,"username":"marcel.amirault","name":"Marcel Amirault","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155490/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marcel.amirault"},"labels":["Category:Code Quality","Enterprise Edition","[Deprecated] Category:Runner","devops::verify","documentation","group::pipeline insights","missed-SLO","needs investigation","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"}],"author":{"id":1704350,"username":"william.nomichith","name":"William Nomichith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6464ca5c3286e459f4b32fd439bbfc80?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/william.nomichith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8008","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8008","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8008/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8008/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#8008","relative":"#8008","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#8008"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24683057,"iid":24700,"project_id":278964,"title":"Frontend does not handle error in diffs properly","description":"When `diffs.json` returns `500` Frontend still shows a loading spinner.\n\nSince most times the page will be scrolled down to the bottom, the flash warning will be missed.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2018-10-15_at_11.24.07](/uploads/9ad8d380b638d9e92b7a7cc6c11fb260/Screen_Shot_2018-10-15_at_11.24.07.png)\n\nLink to reproduce: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/7924/diffs\n\n/cc @andr3","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-15T10:26:04.455Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T12:16:13.195Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T12:16:13.080Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Community contribution","Create [DEPRECATED]","auto closed","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","mr refactor","priority::3","regression","regression:11.1","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

level privilege user\n\n## Description\nThis is achieved by using the project import function, by changing the value of `\"repository_size_limit\":null` to `\"repository_size_limit\":0` in project.json in gitlab export file, then tar with modified project.json, and import the tar file, it will allow user to create project with unlimted repository size\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n- create project, export the project, download the export\n- untar the profile with this cmd `tar -vxzf export.tar.gz`\n- use your favourite text editor to change the project.json, from `\"repository_size_limit\":null` to `\"repository_size_limit\":0`\n- tar all files back with this cmd `tar -cvzf import.tar.gz`\n- upload the tar import to gitlab.com\n\nYou will notice that

API","description":"**[HackerOne report #419977](https://hackerone.com/reports/419977)** by ashish_r_padelkar on 2018-10-06:\n\n**Summary:** \nHello,\n\nIf a public project has following settings, gitlab users with no membership to the project are not allowed to create fork of the projects.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2018-10-06_at_15.13.51.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/419977/356372/Screen_Shot_2018-10-06_at_15.13.51.png)\n\nHowever, using below API endpoint, any body can create fork relationship from such projects \n`https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#create-a-forked-fromto-relation-between-existing-projects`\n\n```\nPOST /projects/:id/fork/:forked_from_id\n```\n\n\n**Description:** \nWhen projects has above settings , the users are not allowed to fork from such projects.\n\nYou can see my own public project here\n\n`[REDACTED]`\n\nYou will not see button to fork. But if you have any other projects then you can create a fork relationship to that project from this project!!\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Just run the following curl command\n\n```\ncurl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: [REDACTED]\" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cYourProjectID\u003e/fork/\u003cPublicProjectIDwithAboveSettings\u003e\n```\n\n2. This will show a fork relationship in your project of public project which should not be possible otherwise\n\nRegards,\nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\n1. This is not intended, so it can create inconsistencies across gitlab\n2. When creating fork relationship using above curl, response shows number of forks the public project has which isn't visible in UI\n3. It shows default `Branch` of the public project which isn't visible in UI if you have above mentioned settings\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [REDACTED]","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-11T01:23:53.079Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T14:35:25.786Z","closed_at":"2020-05-29T09:40:20.060Z","closed_by":{"id":4086191,"username":"cmaxim","name":"Costel Maxim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4086191/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cmaxim"},"labels":["HackerOne","api","backend","devops::create","forking","group::source code","priority::4","security","severity::4","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle Gill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554599/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_gill"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle Gill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554599/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_gill"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24648","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24648","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24648/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24648/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24648","relative":"#24648","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24648"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14840771,"iid":7963,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Rails console message display primary/secondary state incorrectly","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen `gitlab-rails console` is executed, GitLab prints a nice message with some summary information like:\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGitLab: 11.2.1-ee (df8846c)\nGitLab Shell: 8.1.1\npostgresql: 9.6.8\nGeo enabled: yes\nGeo server: secondary\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nThe last line: `Geo server:` does not always reflect the correct state of the server.\nIt consider as \"secondary\" any non-primary server, but a server can be in a \"misconfigured/not configured\" state, where there is no corresponding node to that `external_url`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Rename a secondary node URL in Admin \u003e Geo Node, but doesn't change it in the `/etc/gitlab.rb` file for that node.\n* Run `gitlab-rails console`.

Proposal |\n|---|---|\n| ![image](/uploads/e93f8fae21626fc103b2c4e414ebc7e3/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/e61b97378d72dee5e017c11403148f4b/image.png) |\n\nThis will also mitigate the lack of ability to **edit a pending comment** (in a discussion) and switch between resolving or not the discussion when published. We can toggle it directly in the header with this change. The tooltips should read accordingly: `Discussion will be resolved.`, `Discussion stays resolved.`, `Discussion will be unresolved.`, or `Discussion stays unresolved.`.\n\nBeing able to edit the resolvability of a comment will be tackled in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7920\n\n[:mag: Design specs with the most up-to-date solution and implementation notes](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/pedro/ee%237905-header-pending-comments-spec-previews/)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-06T12:23:46.871Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T08:49:40.625Z","closed_at":"2018-11-29T16:10:08.126Z","closed_by":{"id":482476,"username":"filipa","name":"Filipa Lacerda","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/482476/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/filipa"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","UI polish","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:11.5","priority::2","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":569990,"iid":21,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.6","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-16T19:56:12.651Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T21:40:29.892Z","due_date":"2018-12-22","start_date":"2018-11-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/21"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},{"id":2003748,"username":"jeethukarthik","name":"Jeethu Karthik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2003748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeethukarthik"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":3,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7905","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7905","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7905/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7905/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7905","relative":"#7905","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7905"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":23,"epic":{"id":30,"iid":23,"title":"Batch comments on merge requests","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/23","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2018","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14734788,"iid":7904,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: GitLab Geo attachment replication user uploads attachment to the primary node failing test","description":"# Description\n\nThe geo tests run now, but one of them fails.\n\n```\n1) geo GitLab Geo attachment replication user uploads attachment to the primary node\n     Failure/Error: expect(found).to be_truthy\n     \n       expected: truthy value\n            got: false\n     #

However, the implementation here is not efficient because all requests that change the count are serialized on this one record, sometimes resulting in timeouts errors.\n\n* The usage ping requires a lot of counting\n* We're adding more counting every now and then, e.g. in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/22007.\n\nIn short, concurrent updates to counters in statistics tables (e.g. `project_statistics`) often fail with query timeouts due to resource contention. We need to make updates more performant and non-blocking while still allow the values to be read correctly.\n\nThe proposal here is to provide an efficient implementation of exact counters. By exact, we mean consistent with the postgres database (MVCC compatible).\n\n## Proposal (implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35878)\n\nLet's use the `ProjectStatistics` model as an example. We want to efficiently update `build_artifacts_size` counter without incurring into query timeouts.\n\nIn this MR we introduce a new module `ConterAttribute` that brings counter attributes functionality. It provides a methods `increment_counter` that increments the counter on Redis and schedules a worker after some time to flush the increments to the database.\n\nThis way:\n\n* writes to the primary columns are only performed by the background worker\n* reads can be performed against the primary columns (with some delay in accuracy) or including pending increments\n\n## Blocker\nThis issue is currently blocking:\n\n* **All groups from adding useful usage ping statstics**\n* Issues listed under **Blocks** in [Linked issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24469#related-issues) section of this issue","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-02T10:53:41.834Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T14:57:36.505Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T11:58:52.207Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Database Engineering","Deliverable","backend","bug::performance","database","devops::verify","direction","group::pipeline execution","internal customer","missed-SLO","missed-deliverable","missed:12.10","missed:12.5","missed:12.6","missed:12.7","missed:12.8","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","pipeline processing","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":72,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":12,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24469","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24469","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24469/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24469/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24469","relative":"#24469","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24469"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":24682369,"iid":24468,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display change that made thread outdated in-line","description":"As of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/11584, any time new commits are pushed into an MR that directly touch lines that had diff threads on them, these threads are marked as outdated and get a system note with a link to the comparison between the two MR versions, and the exact line in that diff that represents that change.\n\nThis is useful for reviewers who may want to see how, exactly, their concerns ended up being addressed, before they mark the thread as resolved, or to verify that a thread that was resolved by the MR author was indeed addressed as expected.\n\nHowever, the MR diffs page can be quite slow to load, especially when comparing two different versions (because the comparison isn't cached), and _especially_ when the push involved a rebase or merged commit, which can result in changes being included in the diff that aren't actually relevant.

It's not really hard to reduce the size of the image.\n\n### Further details\n\nIn https://github.com/pivotal-legacy/LicenseFinder/blob/master/Dockerfile we can see a lot of package managers (and therefore languages) being installed. It's inefficient because, for example for Java, only the jdk-8 will be installed. Not only projects using a jdk-9, or jdk-10, won't work, but we also install a lot of packages that will maybe never used.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Create a new image from a lighter and more stable image (I suggest a `debian:stable` instead of an `ubuntu` image)\n- Improve our [detection script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-management/blob/master/run.sh#L87) to install the required dependencies. For example, https://github.com/pivotal-legacy/LicenseFinder/blob/master/Dockerfile#L53 can be deported to this detection script, to be executed during runtime instead.\n- Invite the users to improve this part of the script, to cover more cases.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-management` \u003c 100MB (vs ~2GB today).\nlicense_management should be compatible with many projects out of the box. So we should keep and maintain this auto-detection, instead of asking the users to provide it all the time.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n* [ ] Build custom docker image for dotnet-core/mono.\n* [ ] Remove dotnet-core/mono dependencies from default image.\n* [ ] Update documentation on how to scan dotnet/mono projects using a custom image.\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-30T15:07:22.598Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T14:52:35.372Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T21:23:30.810Z","closed_by":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","bug::performance","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","section::sec","secure:refinement-backend","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

I just start typing the project name.\n\n### Further details\n\n* **Why?:** Dialogs are so prevalent in everything these days that most people just ignore them. GitLab is actually good at this and doesn't overuse modal windows. Forcing a user to also type the namespace provides a double-check that the correct project is being deleted.\n* **Goal:** Prevent deletion of the wrong project\n* **Impact:** Minimal. Some users might be slightly annoyed that they have to type a few more characters to delete a project\n* **Benefit:** Peace of mind. Fewer sad people.\n* **Guesstimated Effort:** Minimal. I looked though the source code and I *think* it's just a small update to `app/views/projects/edit.html.haml`. See the patch below.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe namespace/group should be required during the delete project confirmation.\n\n|Soft delete|Permanently delete| \n|---|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_4.10.35_PM](/uploads/c87a27c06330bc043493d5b3cebd6f70/Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_4.10.35_PM.png)|![Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_4.10.46_PM](/uploads/53a42d5b976b0d3851aa00ddaed43c9c/Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_4.10.46_PM.png)|\n\n##### Proposed Dialog:\nNote that the **Yes, delete project** button is disabled until the `exact string` has been entered.\n\n##### The Patch\n\nN.B.: I don't *actually* know if `full_name` is what we want. Nor do I know if anything else needs to be changed (unit tests, perhaps?). I don't know Ruby nor (Mark) HAML, so this is about as much help as I'll be able to be. :crying\\_cat\\_face: \n\n```patch\nFrom eef8eab1da8ccb54b8d6a53d94acc1cb7d431ef9 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001\nFrom: Douglas Thor \u003cdoug.thor@gmail.com\u003e\nDate: Thu, 27 Sep 2018 11:57:09 -0700\nSubject: [PATCH] Use @project.full_name when prompting users for project\n deletion.\n\n---\n app/views/projects/edit.html.haml | 2 +-\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\ndiff --git a/app/views/projects/edit.html.haml b/app/views/projects/edit.html.haml\nindex bfd165d..019335f 100644\n--- a/app/views/projects/edit.html.haml\n+++ b/app/views/projects/edit.html.haml\n@@ -222,4 +222,4 @@\n       Saving project.\n     %p Please wait a moment, this page will automatically refresh when ready.\n\n-= render 'shared/confirm_modal', phrase: @project.path\n+= render 'shared/confirm_modal', phrase: @project.full_name\n--\n2.7.4\n```\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nNo one complains that they deleted the wrong project :smile:\n\n### Links / references\n\nNone.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-27T19:06:19.301Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T21:28:27.102Z","closed_at":"2020-08-12T12:35:59.135Z","closed_by":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"labels":["Manage [DEPRECATED]","UX","devops::manage","frontend","group::compliance","project","settings","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"}],"author":{"id":381665,"username":"dougthor42","name":"Douglas Thor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f650c56f4679ab2c8dd99b691c16913c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dougthor42"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24401","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24401","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24401/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24401/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24401","relative":"#24401","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24401"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3626,"epic":{"id":69474,"iid":3626,"title":"Improvements to delayed project deletion","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3626","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24682173,"iid":24395,"project_id":278964,"title":"Buttons on Jobs page are misaligned","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n \n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nOn the Jobs page, when there are two buttons for a job they are misplaced and not in alignment with buttons for jobs with only one button.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Overview\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7773, we add the seat history table as part of the GitLab.com billing area redesign work in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6898.\n\nWe should include an Expand button on each row to allow users to get user-by-user detail on the additional users that resulted in the overage.\n\n### Proposal\n\nEach row will have an `Expand` button, which will unfold a nested table detailing which users created the need for new seats.\n\n![expanded-table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/d35e3b5ba8939665b0366c883b3ffdd3/expanded-table.png)\n\nThe columns in the nested table will be:\n\n- _User_: Profile picture, user name and `@username`\n\n- _Joined on_: Date on which the user became a member of the group. This attribute will make it possible to determine when the seat was created.\n\n- _Last activity_: The last time the user had any activity in the group, displayed in _timeago_ format. This will be helpful to determine which users can be removed from the group\n\n- _Member of_: Members of subgroups count towards billing, so this is an important attribute to help determine where seats are being used.\nSince we do not retain information on users once they leave a group, we cannot provide information on which users generated some seats. These will be displayed in a unique row using the following string:\n\n\u003e +X user/users who has/have left the group\nWhen there is a large number of seats, the table will serve them in batches of 10 rows. At the bottom of the table there will be a row reading '[Load more users](/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/ef3168e83170bcdeec4cbe9f611ccc53/expanded--load-more-users.png)', which will load 10 more rows on click.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-27T11:25:09.683Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T16:31:39.401Z","closed_at":"2022-03-03T16:31:27.012Z","closed_by":{"id":8110789,"username":"tgolubeva","name":"Tatyana Golubeva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8110789/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tgolubeva"},"labels":["Category:Purchase","Enterprise Edition","For Scheduling","PM Ready","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::fulfillment","frontend","gitlab.com","group::purchase","section::fulfillment","won't do"],"milestone":{"id":427853,"iid":10,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 3-4 releases","description":"Bigger issues we plan to ship in the next 3-4 releases, but don't have a designated release yet. \r\n\r\n\u003e \"An easy way to look at it for me it's translating to months.

This has different use cases, for example:\n\n| For a regularly scheduled cron like syntax | For ad-hoc windows |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| - For teams that are not global, the ability to halt CICD deployments off-hours. \u003cbr\u003e - Suspend CICD pipelines on weekends when there is limited team availability. | - Special events such as big announcements, livestreams, etc. \u003cbr\u003e - Holidays where there is limited team availability. |\n\n## Intended users\n\n~\"Persona: DevOps Engineer\" \n\n## Proposal\n\n* Store freeze periods in GitLab's database, and reference them from `.gitlab-ci.yml`. \n* Deployment freeze periods will be specified in the GitLab UI on a project level, using cron syntax in a new settings section.\n* We will implement this feature using [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules). See the **Example** section below for an example of this syntax in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.\n* As shown in the example section below, this feature will be an opt-**in**: deploy freezes will not be respected until `.gitlab-ci.yml` is edited to make the deployment jobs aware of deploy freezes.\n* We will modify the pipeline to **Skip** a pipeline found inside the deploy freeze. It will need to be manually restarted once the freeze is over. We will tackle a restart mechanist later on. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211518\n  * Needs investigation: Potentially pivot off [resource groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#resource_group), which gives us restartable jobs after freeze period by default.\n\n## UX Proposal\n\n:star: [SEE PROTOTYPES ON THE `DESIGN` TAB](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24295/designs/deploy-freeze__settings--collapsed.png) :star:\n\n## User story\n\n\u003e As a DevOps Engineer/Release Manager, I want to specify windows of time when deployments are not allowed for an environment with my GitLab project, so that I can interlock it within CI/CD and automation.\n\n* On project `settings \u003e ci/cd`, a new expandable section should be added for **Deploy Freezes**. A helper text should link to the documentation page.\n* Users should have an option to expand/collapse the area. Clicking on \"expand\" shows the form fields to set a deploy freeze.\n* Once the section is expanded, the user will see an action button and either:\n  * An empty state message within a table component, if no deploy freezes are specified, or\n  * A list with specified deploy freezes.\n* Clicking the `Add deployment freeze` button should trigger a modal (~frontend modal size: small) with options to set:\n  * Cron attributes (~frontend component: [form-input](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-form-form-input--default))\n    * User should be able to input only CRON attributes (https://crontab.guru/)\n    * Requires front-end validation. If the data is invalid, an the input shows an error state.\n    * The primary button is disabled until all fields are entered.\n    * If the data is invalid, the button to `Add deployment freeze` should stay disabled. User should not be able to click it until validation succeeds.\n  * Timezone (~frontend component: [dropdown-search with header](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-new-dropdown--with-menu-header))\n    * For now, we will only support the freeze to be specified on the same time zone.\n* Clicking the `Cancel` button should close the modal. No information is stored or updated.\n* Clicking the `Add deploy freeze` button should close the modal and the information about the deployment freeze should be displayed on the page on a table (start, end, time zone).\n\n## Examples\n\n### Technical Example\n\nBelow is an example of a deploy freeze that ensure no production deployments are executed over 23h on christmas eve until 23h on boxing day:\n\n1. Defining the freeze window in the UI ([see example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24295/designs/deploy-freeze__settings--expanded.png))\n1. Making the production deployment job respect the deploy freeze in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   deploy_to_production:\n     stage: deploy\n     script: deploy_to_prod.sh\n     rules:\n       - if: $CI_ENVIRONMENT_FROZEN == null\n   ```\n\n### Further details\n\n- MVC will allow multiple freeze periods to be specified; one period per project is too limiting.\n- UI will be built with Vue.\n- Freeze periods are UNIONed with each other.\n- Specifying a timezone for each entry is a bit repetitive, but is necessary for now. A future iteration might extract this dropdown to a higher level.\n\n## Out of scope\n\nThe following features are considered out of scope for the purposes of this MVC but may be considered as future enhancements:\n\n* Group-level freezes\n* Notifications and UI alerts\n* Restartable jobs, if we don't get this for free by reusing [resource groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#resource_group)\n* Ability to specify deploy freezes using calendar dates/time pickers (as opposed to cron syntax)\n* Human-readable cron syntax descriptions (i.e. \"At 07:00 on Monday\")\n* Freeze period \"groups\" which would allow multiple freeze schedules to be defined and referenced by name in `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n\n## Documentation\n\nYes, this will require a new documentation page.\n\nLink to new page: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#set-a-deploy-freeze","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-21T11:20:46.599Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T12:20:27.866Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T15:32:21.752Z","closed_by":{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Deliverable","Dogfooding","Dogfooding::Rebuild in GitLab","Kickoff Highlight","PM Ready","Persona: DevOps Engineer","Persona: Release Manager","Product Vision FY21","Release::P1","UI text","UX","cicd::active","customer","devops::release","direction","feature::enhancement","frontend","frontend-weight::3","gitlab.com","group::release","internal customer","production request","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":3079878,"username":"rayana","name":"Rayana Verissimo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3079878/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rayana"},{"id":4446737,"username":"jakeburden","name":"Jake Burden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4446737/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jakeburden"}],"author":{"id":1254817,"username":"jarv","name":"John Jarvis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1254817/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jarv"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3079878,"username":"rayana","name":"Rayana Verissimo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3079878/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rayana"},"user_notes_count":194,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24295","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24295","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24295/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24295/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24295","relative":"#24295","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24295"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":767,"epic":{"id":3445,"iid":767,"title":"Make environments easier to use and manage","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/767","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14364572,"iid":7691,"project_id":278964,"title":"Security Review for Geo","description":"We are aiming to deploy Geo for GitLab.com.

It would be good to provide a label so that you can see _at a glance_ that the pipeline is triggered by a cron job.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis came about because a pipeline job coincidentally ran _right after_ a code commit, making it appear the commit was triggering two pipeline jobs. This sparked an investigating to determine if there was a bug - which could have been easily avoided by a label under the job. \n\n### Solution\n\n- Add a `Scheduled` label to pipeline list and detail

However, GitLab's role system is typically considered too broad; for many customers - especially those operating in regulated environments - \"they often resort to setting everyone to Master and trusting their colleagues to not make mistakes\" ([see research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/62)). In almost all cases, instances want to *further constrain* existing roles, instead of permit their users to do more.\n\nIn order for large organizations, especially regulated and security-minded enterprises, to thrive in GitLab we need more granular per-user permissioning.\n\n## Current status\n\nWe're currently trying to better understand the problem space before converging on a solution and are exploring and testing early stage wireframes.\n* If you're interested in the solution to this problem, please share more details on your needs as a comment. \n  * How are you working around this problem now?\n  * What specific controls would you like introduced? \n  * Do you have any comments on the solutions we're exploring?\n\nWe conducted an Opportunity Canvas review on October 10th, which was approved. You can see the canvas here (public URL, anyone can comment):\n\n* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_FPLZ8W7Gjl0tvZSybEKWvcCzJ3AgxlQNFvwm92IHo/edit#\n\n## Possible approach\n\nPlease see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/7626 for the latest on the MVC.\n\n## Reach\n\nThis is primarily a problem for sysadmins ([Sidney](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)), team leads ([Delaney](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)) and Compliance/Security departments.\n\nIn terms of reach, I believe (based on the 48% of users [encountering limitations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/62#note_84346697)) that the current role system in GitLab is sufficient for most but there's significant reach for improvements.\n\n* 3.0 = Significant reach (~25% to ~50%).\n\n## Impact\n\nAmong enterprises, especially those operating in regulated spaces, this can be a hard requirement for use of GitLab. Some existing enterprises have built complex workarounds/automation to manage around this problem, and it's one of Customer Success' most requested features.\n\n* 3.0 = Massive impact\n\n## Confidence\n\nTODO: Add supporting information (issues, TAM toplist, etc).\n\n* 100% = High confidence\n\n## Effort\n\nBased on nothing terribly substantive, I estimate:\n* Design/Research effort: High. We'll need to do a lot of discovery to make sure we get the new system right, since it will be hard to revert.\n* Product effort: Medium. \n* Engineering effort: Medium/High. Roles/permissions are a very mature part of the GitLab application and hard to make substantive changes to. If the solution we pursue involves ripping out the existing system, it will be incredibly expensive.\n\nFor the sake of t-shirt sizing, I'll estimate 3 person-months to get to the MVC.\n\n## Score\n\n(3.0 Reach * 3.0 Impact * 100%) / 3.0 Effort = 3.0\n\nNote: Maybe Impact scale should be the same as Reach :thinking: \n\n### Links / references (GitLab internal)\n\n* User feedback: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HyJa6JZG3KqHHlAOwfkrKlSEyzSqatkCQwkpfb-Ic9c/edit (GitLab internal)\n  * Other customer feedback collected from issues: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MZItci-Uxn4m-uEh5wR5VnC2sTeR_8UYdgaZmO6Yik/edit#","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-17T17:46:50.397Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T18:27:07.599Z","closed_at":"2020-02-26T17:02:52.951Z","closed_by":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Enterprise Edition","Product Vision FY20","UX","UX problem validation","access::technical","customer","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","missed:12.4","priority::1","product discovery [DEPRECATED]","type::feature","workflow::problem validation"],"milestone":{"id":427853,"iid":10,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 3-4 releases","description":"Bigger issues we plan to ship in the next 3-4 releases, but don't have a designated release yet. \r\n\r\n\u003e \"An easy way to look at it for me it's translating to months.

An 'already exists in source' error is returned when trying to save their ProjectMember object, so `persisted?` evaluates to false.  This occurs because the importing user was already added to the project before `map` is built by the `ensure_default_member!` method.\n\n[line 36](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/members_mapper.rb#L36)\n```rb\nmap.keys.include?(old_author_id) \u0026\u0026 map[old_author_id] != default_user_id\n```\nIn the `include?` method, we check that `old_author_id` does not match `default_user_id`.  As the user performing the import is the default user, this condition cannot be met and `update_note_for_missing_author` will always be triggered.\n\n\n/cc @jameslopez","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-17T03:15:47.153Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T16:39:46.903Z","closed_at":"2021-12-20T19:06:51.899Z","closed_by":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Importer:Project Export/Import","Next Up","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::import","milestone::p3","priority::4","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"}],"author":{"id":2578846,"username":"wchandler","name":"Will Chandler","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8b92738249753faee7055e021f8221?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wchandler"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24204","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24204","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24204/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24204/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24204","relative":"#24204","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24204"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3054,"epic":{"id":39522,"iid":3054,"title":"🐞 Project Export/Import bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3054","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14165730,"iid":7602,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Create Geo HA Upgrade documentation","description":"We should consider adding some Geo HA upgrade documentation.

Authors also need to be included in the approvers list in order to be able to approve their merge request.\n\nTurns out that we saw users that normally don't set approvers explicitly (project or MR settings) raising the following concern:\n\n1. No approvers are set on MR or Project (but at least one approve is needed on the MR)\n2. Self-approval is enabled on project-level settings\n3. Author (which is maintainer) creates a MR\n4. Author cannot approve their own MR, but can approve other user MRs (because they're '\u003e= Developer')\n\nThe point is that we should evaluate if authors should be able to approve or not their own MR in the scenario above. Given the documented ['Eligible approvers'](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#eligible-approvers), we currently allow '\u003e= Developer' members to approve, if there's no explicit approvers set, or the number of approvers set is lower than the current number of approvals needed. Therefore, should we also allow authors to self-approve is that scenario?\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the **self-approval** behavior to be consistent with the documented [eligible approvers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#eligible-approvers) behavior.\n\nIf self-approval is enabled, and `explicit approvers \u003c required approvals` allow all Developers to approve the merge request.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-10T17:55:00.122Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:16:34.180Z","closed_at":"2019-04-04T08:23:34.968Z","closed_by":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","approvals","backend","customer","devops::create","missed-deliverable","missed:11.8","missed:11.9","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":655279,"iid":27,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.10","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-21T19:08:16.261Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T09:17:49.051Z","due_date":"2019-04-22","start_date":"2019-03-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/27"},"assignees":[{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":11493,"username":"oswaldo","name":"Oswaldo Ferreira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/oswaldo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7532","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7532","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7532/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7532/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7532","relative":"#7532","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7532"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14040075,"iid":7531,"project_id":278964,"title":"Track changes in merge request approval settings in the audit log","description":"_\"Rules\" aspect moved to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209222_\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nTracking changes in merge request approval settings ~~and rules~~ in the audit log\n\n### Further details\n\nClient proposed change in Zendesk ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/103355 (Internal use only)\n\nThey asked if the audit logs could address changes to required approvers (how many, enabled/disabled).\n\n### Important Note\n\nAs of %\"12.7\" `Administrators` will be able to [set instance-wide rules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39060) for MR approvals that will restrict these settings at the project level for any non-admins. \n\nCurrently scheduled for %\"12.8\" is an iteration to bring this functionality to the [group level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/119344) for `.com` customers and will follow similar logic: only `Group Owners` can modify the settings at the project level.\n\nThis activity - the modification of MR approval settings - should still be logged, though this detail may affect how it's logged and with what supplemental data.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should log, at the **group level** the three most important details of the MR approval settings and iterate to include additional settings later.

These include:\n* Changing the merge method strategy for a project\n* Changing the default MR template\n* Changing settings:\n  * Merge request approvals \n  * Only allow merge requests to be merged if the pipeline succeeds \n  * Only allow merge requests to be merged if all discussions are resolved\n  * Automatically resolve merge request diff discussions when they become outdated\n  * Show link to create/view merge request when pushing from the command line\n* Approvers List Changes\n  * e.g. `User` modified `Project` to `add` `User` as an approver for merge requests\n  * e.g. `User`

solve\n\nVia https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/50157 we explored that a user's job title is interesting information that is currently not visible within GitLab.\n\ngitlab-ce#51246 looks at how we can add this information to the user profile.\n\n### Proposal\n\nLet's add a user's job title to the user profile.\n\n* Hide `Role` field in user profile settings from end user (the entered value doesn't even display on their public profile anyway right now)\n* Show information in profile page header if set\n  * Job title should be integrated in the Company field in settings and display\n\n### Solution\n\nLet's redistribute the information in the header a bit:\n\n```\n1st line: Full name\n2nd line: username, joined info\n3rd line: location and job title at organization info\n4th line: social + website\n```\n\nHere's what it looks like on desktop:\n\n| With bio | Without bio |\n|----------|-------------|\n| ![image](/uploads/851a26777720f7a67563aa01752e8df6/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/42495c7ee07b857fbf4a868ae0d3b6dc/image.png) |\n\nThe margins between the 2nd and 3rd line (as defined above) should be `8px`, the margin between the 1st and the 2nd,  3rd and 4th should be `16px`.\n\nThere won't be enough space to fit the location and job title + org into a single line so it's best we put each in their own lines:\n\n![image](/uploads/e1b02398bb112dfa95c6133960a61d46/image.png)\n\nWe also need to add a 'Job title' input field to the profile settings page. \n\n![image](/uploads/29dcc402d1dcae926e779d235fa27d98/image.png)\n\nWe also need to update how we display the job title information in the extended user tooltips. We can combine it with the 'Organization' information and say 'UX designer _at_ GitLab`, so `{ job title } at { organization }`. We can use the briefcase icon for both. If we don't have the job title information we only show the organization and if we don't have the organization we only show the job title. So these are the possible combinations:\n\n* { job title } at { organization }\n* { job title }\n* { organization }\n\n![image](/uploads/1c7dec1f77d41135d9d3c254a638b44c/image.png)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWhen completed, other users can see a users role on the user's profile page if defined","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-10T12:18:42.704Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T16:28:35.138Z","closed_at":"2020-03-19T16:28:35.090Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","customer","devops::manage","estimation::completed","frontend","frontend-weight::4","group::spaces DEPRECATED","priority::3","type::feature","user profile","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"}],"author":{"id":2263795,"username":"akaemmerle","name":"Andreas Kämmerle","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/52b29212f6c52f2d58d8fd848e43a7d9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/akaemmerle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":75,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":9,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24072","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24072","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24072/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24072/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24072","relative":"#24072","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24072"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14017415,"iid":7516,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add QA test scenarios for Geo HTTP \u0026 SSH push-to-secondary proxy feature","description":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6456 added the ability for Geo setups to support pushing to the secondary over SSH and have the secondary proxy the request to the primary.

permissions:\n\n* group [owner: user1]\n    * subgroup [owner: user1, user2]\n        * project [owner: user1, user2]\n\nI want to remove user2 of both the subgroup and project.\n\nI don't have any way to do so.\n\nMembers view of subgroup for user1:\n\n![subUser1](/uploads/aa6c1d8816c1fe5a993b8989156ef319/subUser1.PNG)\n\nMembers view of project for user1:\n\n![projectUser1](/uploads/d6f65bd18502ecb462e42d71094a3071/projectUser1.PNG)\n\nMembers view of subgroup for user2:\n\n![subUser2](/uploads/bae354dcdfba02e6130a753ce5634caa/subUser2.PNG)\n\nMembers view of project for user2:\n\n![projectUser2](/uploads/f37b3792afe1fd249a5ac9e2ec7bcd01/projectUser2.PNG)\n\n\nI would expect that user2 can be removed by any way (either by user2 removing himself or by user1 removing user2 and in any order subgroup -\u003e project / project -\u003e subgroup).\n\nThere are two similar issues but they are different:\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34975 =\u003e It was a User error, problem could be resolved\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33129 =\u003e Discussion about remove order\n\nFor this issue both don't matter. I'm generally unable to remove user2 from project and subgroup.\n\nDo I miss something?\n\n### Workaround\n\n* Explicitly assign a new Owner. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/24047#note_215213338.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. If only one owner is left at the the project/subgroup/group - Show the remove button greyed out and display the tooltip on hover\n\nText should be: \n- For groups: `A group must have at least one owner. To remove the member, assign a new owner.`\n- For projects: `A project must have at least one owner. To remove the member, assign a new owner.` \n\nA future iteration can be to enable the \"Remove member\" button but open a model to assign a new owner - this would both remove the member (previous owner) and assign a new one in one action\n\n### Availability and Testing\n- No new E2E test or updates needed at this time. Please add the appropriate coverage for the new tooltip in unit and integration tests.\n- Test cases to consider:\n  - Verify the tooltip displays when a group has only one owner\n  - Verify the tooltip displays when a project has only one owner\n  - Verify the tooltip does not display when a group has multiple owners\n  - Verify the tooltip does not display when a project has multiple owners\n  - Verify the tooltip does display when a group has multiple owners and they get removed one by one until only one owner is left - that is when the tooltip should appear for the remaining owner\n  - Ensure to test these scenarios with direct, inherited and shared owners","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-07T11:33:26.011Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T16:30:05.244Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T16:26:14.445Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"labels":["Category:User Management","Deliverable","customer","devops::manage","estimation::completed","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::organization","milestone::p2","priority::4","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item","section::dev","security","security-backlog::valid","settings","severity::4","type::feature","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"}],"author":{"id":1292212,"username":"Spenhouet","name":"Sebastian Penhouet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1292212/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Spenhouet"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":66,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":16,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24047","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24047","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24047/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/24047/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#24047","relative":"#24047","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#24047"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5791,"epic":{"id":251732,"iid":5791,"title":"Membership management additions and improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5791","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e3\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13969135,"iid":7493,"project_id":278964,"title":"Configuring Prometheus alerts causes Cluster Install page to display error message","description":"![Screen_Shot_2018-09-07_at_11.08.56_AM](/uploads/d7bbf877105edf7248d74118b911b37b/Screen_Shot_2018-09-07_at_11.08.56_AM.png)\n\nWhen configuring the prometheus alerting under \"Custom Metrics\", there is a period when the Cluster Install page displays an error message for the Prometheus app. The status for Prometheus app now says \"Install\" (what happens you click that button ?!)\n\n## What should happen\n\nPrometheus app has no error message and is still \"Installed\"\n\nWhile the applications are undergoing the `updating` status, show that the application is still being installed by showing the `Installing` button.

We can make this a bit easier by adding a search input to the boards switcher dropdown:\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/45f0599fbc6de4016fa7f7f5c68b0eba/image.png)\n\n- [Design specs](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/pedro/ee%237715-filter-issue-boards-spec-previews/)\n- Component docs: [Search](https://design.gitlab.com/components/search) and [Dropdowns](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdowns/)\n- The filter field should be focused when opening the dropdown.\n- Display `No matching boards found` when filtering didn't return any results\n\nThis is a small effort for a big gain in UX. It does not solve the root problem of duplicated and unused boards, but it definitely alleviates that issue.\n\n### Implementation\n\n- [x] moving the Vue template out of HAML: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/8519\n- [ ] replace the dropdown implementation with gitlab-ui\n   - add dropdown components to gitlab-ui: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/merge_requests/83\n   - use new components in the switcher: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/8591\n   - afterwards keyboard navigation works and `Switch board` header is added\n- [ ] add search field to dropdown\n   - add search field to gitlab-ui: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/merge_requests/96\n   - afterwards new merge request in EE for updating the dropdown\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-05T18:42:40.659Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:22:41.942Z","closed_at":"2019-01-07T19:50:20.418Z","closed_by":{"id":502136,"username":"fatihacet","name":"Fatih Acet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/502136/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fatihacet"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","boards","depth","devops::plan","direction","frontend","missed-deliverable","missed:11.6","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":581385,"iid":22,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.7","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-26T15:14:47.054Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T18:12:10.925Z","due_date":"2019-01-22","start_date":"2018-12-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/22"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":1212235,"username":"winh","name":"Inactive Account","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e34b010c96ff3f44c62cddf66607232a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/winh"}],"author":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":60,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7715","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":1},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7715","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7715/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7715/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7715","relative":"#7715","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7715"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":336,"epic":{"id":982,"iid":336,"title":"Managing many boards","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/336","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13936159,"iid":7479,"project_id":278964,"title":"Saved configuration in chart","description":"Follow up https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7478 to have a saved configuration, so when you return to it (or anybody), it will have the same saved configuration.\n\nA saved configuration is the same as a saved configuration for an issue board.

Snowplow's built-in method is to attach listeners to every `\u003ca href\u003e` on a page after load, but we want to selectively apply listeners to events in order to manage page performance and ensure we're tracking only what we need.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should create a generic JS function that we can apply to whatever events we determine are important.\n\nNew file `stats.js` that can be imported with a function `trackEvent(category, eventName, { additionalData })` that function then needs to determine if by example Snowplow is activated and loaded and send then this data to Snowplow, later we can also add support for the other statistic packages if needed.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* We have a generic JS function we can apply to any event we'd like to track across GitLab.com.\n  * Other teams can pick up this function and easily use it to track events in their respective product categories.\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-03T09:03:41.001Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:17:03.667Z","closed_at":"2018-10-03T17:59:59.785Z","closed_by":{"id":1149402,"username":"timzallmann","name":"Tim Zallmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1149402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/timzallmann"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Manage [DEPRECATED]","analytics","devops::manage","frontend","gitlab.com","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":567670,"iid":19,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.4","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-14T17:31:41.249Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T06:49:55.749Z","due_date":"2018-10-22","start_date":"2018-09-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/19"},"assignees":[{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7424","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7424","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7424/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7424/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7424","relative":"#7424","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7424"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":325,"epic":{"id":849,"iid":325,"title":"Event tracking for GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/325","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 22, 2018","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
