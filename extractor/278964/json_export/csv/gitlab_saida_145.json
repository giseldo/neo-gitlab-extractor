The issue allows an attacker to create any file with an extension “.nupkg” in the filesystem. By combining the bug with a race condition in Gitaly which I used several times before (#762421, #732330). It could finally be used to read sensitive files in a GitLab instance.\n\nFor some context, a large part of the exploit were explained in #762421, the npm registry issue. Here I will focus on the simple path traversal part which makes a little bit difference.\n\nThe root cause of the path traversal lies at `ee/app/services/packages/nuget/metadata_extraction_service.rb`  \n```  \n      XPATHS = {                                                                 \n        package_name: '//xmlns:package/xmlns:metadata/xmlns:id',                 \n        package_version: '//xmlns:package/xmlns:metadata/xmlns:version'          \n      }.freeze   \n...  \n      def extract_metadata(file)                                                 \n        doc = Nokogiri::XML(file)                                                \n                                                                                 \n        XPATHS.map do |key, query|                                               \n          [key, doc.xpath(query).text]                                           \n        end.to_h   \n```  \nIt extracts the uploaded nupkg (which is in zip format) for the contained nuspec file (which is an XML). And then looks for attribute `id` and `version`. Then the extracted package_name(id), and package_version(version) will be concatenated into a new filename in `ee/app/services/packages/nuget/update_package_from_metadata_service.rb`  \n```                                                                        \n        [@]package_file.transaction do                                             \n          [@]package_file.update!(                                                 \n            file_name: package_filename,                                         \n            file: [@]package_file.file                                             \n          )        \n...  \n      def package_filename                                                       \n        \"#{package_name.downcase}.#{package_version.downcase}.nupkg\"             \n      end      \n```  \nSo my payload is:  \n```                                                                    \n  \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e                                         \n  \u003cpackage xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2013/05/nuspec.xsd\"\u003e    \n    \u003cmetadata\u003e                                                                   \n      \u003cid\u003eDummyProject.DummyPackage\u003c/id\u003e                                         \n      \u003cversion\u003e../../../../../nyangawa\u003c/version\u003e                                              \n    \u003c/metadata\u003e                                                                  \n  \u003c/package\u003e                                                                     \n```  \nname the file above as `dummy.nuspec` and zip it into `dummy.nupkg` and upload it through `PUT /api/v4/projects/#{id}/packages/nuget/` endpoint  will make GitLab to create a `nyangawa.nupkg` somewhere in the filesystem.\n\nThen I wrote a script (I used in #762421) to combine this issue and the race in Gitaly. I could finally read any file I want in my GitLab instance.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Download the attached exploit.tar.gz and extract it.  \n2. Install some requirements by gem install faraday and gem install rubyzip  \n3. Edit exp.rb to update some url and credentials  \n4. Execute the exp.rb to watch the result of .gitlab_shell_secret of target GitLab instance.\n\n### Examples  \n![2020-03-17-234802_649x700_scrot.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/e7b86888-5307-4fac-9d89-297a5bef6934/2020-03-17-234802_649x700_scrot.png)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info  \n```  \nroot@localhost:/# gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info\n\nSystem information  \nSystem:\t\t  \nProxy:\t\tno  \nCurrent User:\tgit  \nUsing RVM:\tno  \nRuby Version:\t2.6.5p114  \nGem Version:\t2.7.10  \nBundler Version:1.17.3  \nRake Version:\t12.3.3  \nRedis Version:\t5.0.7  \nGit Version:\t2.24.1  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.7  \nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:\t12.8.7-ee  \nRevision:\t2643fd87200  \nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails  \nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL  \nDB Version:\t10.12  \nURL:\t\thttp://10.26.0.5  \nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://10.26.0.5/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@10.26.0.5:some-group/some-project.git  \nElasticsearch:\tno  \nGeo:\t\tno  \nUsing LDAP:\tno  \nUsing Omniauth:\tyes  \nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:\t11.0.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell  \nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git  \n```\n\nps.

As of writing there seems to be 590 firewall rules in use by gitlab-review-apps.\nFrom what I can tell in GCP we need 6 firewall rules per release:\n2 for nginx-ingress-controller-svc (443,22) https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/service/us-central1-b/review-apps-ee/review-apps-ee/review-11024-add-zs5uux-nginx-ingress-controller?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026tab=overview\u0026duration=PT1H\u0026pod_summary_list_tablesize=20\n1 for minio-svc via K8s ingress (9000) https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/service/us-central1-b/review-apps-ee/review-apps-ee/review-11024-add-zs5uux-minio-svc?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026tab=overview\u0026duration=PT1H\u0026pod_summary_list_tablesize=20\n1 for registry-svc via K8s ingress (5000) https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/service/us-central1-b/review-apps-ee/review-apps-ee/review-11024-add-zs5uux-registry?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026tab=overview\u0026duration=PT1H\u0026pod_summary_list_tablesize=20\n2 for unicorn-svc via K8s Ingress (8080, 8181) https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/service/us-central1-b/review-apps-ee/review-apps-ee/review-11024-add-zs5uux-unicorn?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026tab=overview\u0026duration=PT1H\u0026pod_summary_list_tablesize=20\nThere are 42 releases via helm ls -d | wc -l which adds up to 252 that is way less than the current 590. Do you see anything that I’m missing?\n\n@rymai \nI think you’re right and I actually noticed the same yesterday: that the total number of rules we have is far greater than the (number of Review Apps) * (rules per RA). It seems there are rules like https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/details/k8s-a00947bb4649011ea9f9f42010af0022-http-hc?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0 with a random port, it seems.\nThere are approx. 286 of those…\n\n@rymai \nI think these are the controller.service.healthCheckNodePort as documented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/tree/master/charts%2Fnginx.\n\n\u003e If controller.service.type is NodePort or LoadBalancer and controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local, set this to the managed health-check port the kube-proxy will expose. If blank, a random port in the NodePort range will be assigned\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Questions\n\n\n- [x] ~~How many rules are needed per review app instance?~~ What resources are needed per review app instance?\n\n  * [1 load balancer](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/loadBalancers/list?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026folder\u0026organizationId=769164969568\u0026filter=%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22a00ab062f5fca11ea8ae742010af001c_5C_22_22_2C_22s_22_3Atrue%257D%255D).\n  * [1 target pool](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/advanced/targetPools/details/regions/us-central1/targetPools/a00ab062f5fca11ea8ae742010af001c?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0)\n  * [2 firewall rules](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/list?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0\u0026pageState=(%22firewallTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22abbbaceb0685511ea9f9f42010af0022_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22)))\n    * 1 for [healthCheckNodePort (ends with `http-hc`)](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/details/k8s-a00ab062f5fca11ea8ae742010af001c-http-hc?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0)\n    * 1 for [https and gitlab-shell (starts with `k8s-fw`)](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/details/k8s-fw-abbbaceb0685511ea9f9f42010af0022?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0) ![Screenshot_2020-03-20_at_5.53.36_PM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/054aa9b82cfef150846bfedc45bc3786/Screenshot_2020-03-20_at_5.53.36_PM.png)\n  * [1 forwarding rule](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/advanced/forwardingRules/details/regions/us-central1/forwardingRules/a00ab062f5fca11ea8ae742010af001c?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0)\n  * [1 health check](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/healthChecksDetail/httpHealthChecks/a00ab062f5fca11ea8ae742010af001c?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0)\n\n- [x] Are there unattached rules that remain?\n\nYes. As of 2020-03-23T05:08:10+00:00, there are 181 rules in `review-apps-ee`, but there are only 6 `nginx-ingress-controller` service in `review-apps-ee`\n\n- [x] Why are there random ports opened for certain rules like https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/details/k8s-a00947bb4649011ea9f9f42010af0022-http-hc?project=gitlab-review-apps\u0026authuser=0? \n\nThe ports that are not 80, 443, 80 are used by nginx-ingress-controller service's HealthCheckNodePorts.

As such we now test the API on our 10k Reference Environment against 250 groups with 10 projects each (a total of 2500 projects) at 200 RPS:\n\n```\n* Environment:                10k\n* Environment Version:        13.2.0-pre `744484487f2`\n* Option:                     60s_200rps\n* Date:                       2020-06-30\n* Run Time:                   1h 4m 21.39s (Start: 01:27:22 UTC, End: 02:31:44 UTC)\n* GPT Version:                v2.0.3\n\nNAME                                                     | RPS   | RPS RESULT           | TTFB AVG   | TTFB P90              | REQ STATUS      | RESULT \n---------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------\napi_v4_projects                                          | 200/s | 50.68/s (\u003e32.00/s)   | 3490.03ms  | 4244.82ms (\u003c7500ms)   | 100.00% (\u003e95%)  | Passed \n```\n\nMetrics:\n![Screenshot_2020-06-30_at_14.38.46](/uploads/30651123ab0b9d8dea1a76a697273e7d/Screenshot_2020-06-30_at_14.38.46.png)\n\nFor this endpoint in particular there's some more data to point out. On gitlab.com, data looks to show it performing substantially worse than we see on our smaller environments:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nWorst performing Rails API routes in the applications, by p95 latency\n\n/api/:version/projects\n\np95 latency for this route: 15s (find related issues)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nThe endpoint appears to be then exponential in how it degrades as the number of projects rise.

As part of this, we changed how data was requested to use the API instead of the controller. See: gitlab-org/gitlab#33905.\n\nThe new ~frontend also relies on data that is exclusively returned by the API, making implementing this change a little more complex.\n\n### Proposal\n\nChange the projects and group packages controller to send the initial list of packages to the Vue ~frontend. This will result in 1 less API request and potentially speed up the first load.\n\nFor this to work, we should consider:\n\n1. Creating a new `packages_list` presenter that returns the package list data in a universal format\n2. Update the controller and api to use this dedicated presenter so the data returned from either is the same\n3. Update the Vue ~frontend to support the initial load from the controller\n4. Also: consider updating the Vue ~frontend to support initial loading of pagination / sort options\n5. Add tests for the new `packages_list` presenter\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nPackages list will initially load data from the controller, resulting in 1 less API request per page load.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-17T14:03:05.872Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T17:41:13.233Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T10:41:22.768Z","closed_by":{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick Kipling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nkipling"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","api","backend","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","type::feature","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

branch has no merge request.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nNavigate to any project, open the Web IDE from the main project page which opens the project on master. Observe that there is a merge request linked in the bottom bar.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nA merge request is linked that is not relevant to the branch opened in the Web IDE.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOn master (or a branch with no MR) there should not be a Merge Request shown. When the branch has a merge request it should be appropriately linked.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screenshot_2020-03-16_20.38.34](/uploads/4008326d16f0e25705c6720bd57d4889/Screenshot_2020-03-16_20.38.34.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-17T01:39:26.390Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T12:03:57.961Z","closed_at":"2020-06-30T11:45:16.565Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Discovery","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","missed-SLO","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","priority::2","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":3457201,"username":"viktomas","name":"Tomas Vik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3457201/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/viktomas"}],"author":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3457201,"username":"viktomas","name":"Tomas Vik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3457201/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/viktomas"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211443","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211443","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211443/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211443/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211443","relative":"#211443","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211443"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32057564,"iid":211423,"project_id":278964,"title":"Expose a portion of free .com users to the new purchase flow","description":"## Experiment Summary\nBy decreasing the required steps and providing a more intuitive interface we can increase the purchase rate for .com group purchases. \n \n## Hypothesis \nWe will see an increase in the successful purchase rate by providing users with a more intuitive checkout experience. \n \n## Supporting Data\n[This mural](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1584571627942/0457a9500d8a2176c870da925893c18fcd124eb0) documents the current checkout experience which requires a total of 3 screens and 6 user actions between inputs and required scrolling before they enter their credit card information. \n \nThe new checkout funnel we will be testing consists of 1 screen and 3 inputs prior to address/credit card details ([see existing user portion of this mural for designs](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1580942836609/7a1ca98cd7ac0c2309b43e5e34aa22a039744b3f)).\n \n## Experiment Design\n* Users to target: free group owners\n* Page to target for the experiment: Group billing page\n* Roll out: We will start with a roll-out of 10% of eligible free group owners and slowly increase to 50%\n* If a user is in the experiment group then we should prefill the group upgrade dropdown in the checkout flow with the name of the group from which they clicked the upgrade button. For example, if I'm a member of 3 groups, one with the name `XYZ`. If I click \"upgrade\" from the group billing page of group `XYZ` then in the checkout funnel the question regarding where the subscription should be applied (question titled: \"GitLab Grou\") should be prefilled with my group `XYZ`.\n \nThe control free group owners that select to upgrade on a group billing page will be sent to the existing checkout funnel. The experiment free group owners that select to upgrade on a group billing page will be sent to the new checkout funnel design by the ~\"group::acquisition\" team (linked below).\n \nThis experiment will not require any design work as the new checkout funnel we will be testing is already live.\n \n[This issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/-/issues/60) by the ~\"group::acquisition\" team covers the part of the new checkout funnel creation where they added the option to select which group the user wants to upgrade which is required for this experiment.\n \nThe URL we will utilize in the experiment version to link existing free owners to the new checkout funnel is: https://gitlab.com/-/subscriptions/new\n \n## Experiment tracking\nIn order to successfully track this experiment, we will need to be able to know what bucket a  free group owner is in. We will also need to be able to track the conversion rate for both the control from the point of upgrade click to check out complete. If we're unable to track this at the user level then we can run the experiment at the namespace level and track the click to checkout complete rate for the namespace. \n \n## Estimated Experiment Length and Impact\nOver the last three months, we've averaged 330 subscriptions purchased per month. If we want to reach significance at 95% confidence level with 5% margin of error then we need 178 upgrades in our experiment group. If our experiment is running at 50% of total upgrades this means the experiment will need to run for ~32 days. \n \n If we were to achieve a 5% absolute increase in the checkout completion rate in the experiment group this would represent ~$60,000 in IACV.

diffs","description":"## What\n\nWe must address some performance concerns with performing the code coverage analysis on large datasets before we can remove the `:coverage_report_view` feature flag so it is enabled by default. @ayufan has outlined some concerns in !21791 that will need to be addressed before we can remove the feature flag.\n\n## Concerns\n\nLikely it would be better to store these comparison results in some place that is persistent. Having to recalculate the comparison results each time this is loaded or even using redis to cache portions of that calculation has proven to be inefficient. In order to alleviate performance concerns with this we should establish a persistent storage strategy for the comparison results.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::testing\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_testing`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @rickywiens / @jheimbuck_gl \n\n## Proposal\nFrom !27744:\n\n\u003eThe parsed report is then stored in a new `PipelineProcessedReport` model as a file in object-store. Merge-requests fetch the file via `ReactiveCache` mechanism, frame the results (filter the files, which are shown in the merge-request) and cache it in Redis as part of the mechanism.\n\n\u003eThis change reduced the load-time of inline coverage information to *\u003c5 seconds* (initial visit) or *immediately* (subsequent visits) for *200 MB* of raw coverage data (GitLab produces around *20 MB*), which is in steep contrast to the [original performance measured here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21791#note_277025922).\n\nWe should continue the approach proposed in !27744 and get it to a state where we can work off of it. \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe inline-code coverage view in the MR diff should load in less than 5 seconds on initial MR diff view for the gitlab-org/gitlab project\n\nThe inline-code coverage view in the MR diff should load in less than 1 second on subsequent views of the MR diff for the gitlab-org/gitlab project\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe inline-code-coverage loading does not appear on the MR diff view\n\nThe inline-code coverage loads slowly on the MR diff view\n\nMore files than we expected are persisted into object store\n\nLarger files than we expected are persisted into object store\n\n\u003c!-- ### What can we monitor to detect problems with this? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- ## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n- ... --\u003e\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Address concerns\n- [x] Establish expectations for rollout\n- [x] Establish interested parties for turning feature on early\n- [x] Enable on staging\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the

`#production`\n- [x] Cross post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add

I think it would work with the table component and it will show more content.\n- Applied new status system and its visual: For now, I don't think we need to make the status `clickable`. And maybe clickable later, if there's any information to show :)\n- **Showing the latest event**: For provide better experience, I put the latest event log on the table.\n- Accordion includes the time logs: The assumption behind this design was that users want to check the `status` not the detail at first. If they need to check the details, then it's okay to make 1 step more to click on the table.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-16T16:57:19.793Z","updated_at":"2021-09-09T10:17:44.811Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T11:43:33.107Z","closed_by":{"id":4903414,"username":"sunjungp","name":"Sunjung Park","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a2c072c26031ffd81b676b43eeb7b781?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sunjungp"},"labels":["Technical Writing","UI text","UX","UX scorecard-rec","devops::systems","geo::planning","group::geo","link::parent issue","workflow::design"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4903414,"username":"sunjungp","name":"Sunjung Park","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a2c072c26031ffd81b676b43eeb7b781?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sunjungp"}],"author":{"id":4903414,"username":"sunjungp","name":"Sunjung Park","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a2c072c26031ffd81b676b43eeb7b781?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sunjungp"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4903414,"username":"sunjungp","name":"Sunjung Park","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a2c072c26031ffd81b676b43eeb7b781?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sunjungp"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211396","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211396","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211396/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211396/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211396","relative":"#211396","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211396"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":369,"epic":{"id":1104,"iid":369,"title":"Geo: Improve UI/UX on Administrator Panel","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/369","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32046669,"iid":211392,"project_id":278964,"title":"POC: Snapshot testing with Jest","description":"The follow up of a quick spike done in *12.9* for the issue [Create e2e (or integration) visual test for the metrics dashboard (#205631)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205631) \n\nSnapshot tests are \"a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.\"\n\nSince we are migrating our tests to Jest, we can consider[Snapshot Testing with Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) a viable alternative.\n\n*“Snapshot testing is the technique of asserting by comparing two different outputs.

License seats can cost up to $1199 per user, per year.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* Bobby the Business Owner - \"If we spend more than $X this quarter/year, there will be severe consequences\"\n* Suzie the Accountant - \"We have $X money in the bank, we can't spend more than $X.\"\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nBusiness use case:\n\nCompany/org can only afford x licenses users in their annual budget. They'd like to keep new users sign up enabled on their instance but ensure sure they do not exceed users beyond what they can afford.\n\n### Example\n\n\u003e **Customer, about to write a check to Software Company**: I have X thousand dollars that I'm prepared to give you, but I absolutely cannot spend any more than that. Times are tough and budgets are tight, what can I do to make sure we don't spend more than we can afford?\n\n- **Option A** (how it is today): Turn off new user creation.\n- **Option B** ([coming soon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244493)): Tell your Systems Administrator to look for banners about overages in the web interface and let your accounting team know when he sees them.\n- **Option C** (what I'm proposing here): \"check out this feature you can opt-in to and configure based on your budget to make sure you don't spend more than you can afford!\"\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd an optional \"Max User\" setting for licensed self-managed GitLab instances as a mechanism by which customers with a budget or financial constraints can set a \"safe\" limit to prevent overspending.\n\nI propose this setting is off-by-default and opt-in only. In this case, only customers who definitely don't want to go over their licensed seats would use the limit feature. All customers who want to add users now and pay later would keep it disabled by default.\n\nThe idea is that new users and license seats can grow up to a customer-defined Maximum, and after reaching the limit, customers need admin to approve or create accounts new accounts or raise the limit.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis setting should be opt-in and configurable only for GitLab self-managed administrators.\n\n### Documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n1. `user cap` is field is default to empty, and will be treated as `unlimited`\n1. only allows non negative integer input, invalid input will result in an error message\n1. any new sign-ups will require admin approval once the user cap in met.\n1. once `user cap` is met, new sign-ups will trigger an email notification to admin.\n1. when `require admin approval for new sign-ups` checkbox is checked, regardless of what number is set in `user cap`, all new sign-ups needs approval\n1. when number of current user drops below `user cap` number, new sign-ups does not require approval\n1. only admin has access to this setting\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n**Customers who need to configure max licensed users as a budgeting safeguard have an option to do so.**\n\nZero change in all other situations.\n\nSuccess is measured by if you can answer the following with \"yes\"\n\n1. Is the max licensed users setting option off by default, opt-in only?\n1. Do GitLab self-managed customers have a mechanism to limit their maximum expenses if they have a limited budget?\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n- **Customers with a tight budget or limited amount of money to spend on DevOps tooling.**\n- Public sector and organizations with *annual* budgets that require approval. (quarterly billing and true-ups make it difficult to estimate the yearly cost for approval)\n- Companies and organizations with budgets approved *annually* or *quarterly*. (we can pay this much per year/quarter, no wiggle room)\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nIt would affect Growth, Licensing and Renewals, and Support.\n\nI this could be helpful in resolving license disputes to deflecting tickets where a customer writes to Support: \"I did not intend for seats to be added beyond X, I didn't even realize that users could create new accounts that we'd get billed for. Now we cannot afford a license for these extra users\".\n\n--- \n\nUpdate: per [this comment](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4315#note_408724791) we are using `User Cap` for this feature.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-16T15:48:05.772Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T14:49:37.226Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T08:17:41.522Z","closed_by":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"labels":["#field-fyi","Deliverable","Engineering","Fulfillment Priority","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","customer","devops::fulfillment","frontend","group::utilization","quad-planning::complete-action","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"}],"author":{"id":3645992,"username":"greg","name":"Greg Myers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3645992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/greg"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"user_notes_count":75,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":1,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211390","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211390","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211390/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211390/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211390","relative":"#211390","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211390"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4315,"epic":{"id":103540,"iid":4315,"title":"[Self-managed] Give Admins control over accidental user overages via a `User Cap` admin setting","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4315","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32045418,"iid":211389,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create CompareAcccessibilityReports and add API to fetch MR a11y reports diffs","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe want to add a merge request widget for listing `a11y` violations between two branches, but there's no API to fetch a comparison of two accessibility reports.\n\n### Proposal\n\nBuild a `CompareAccessibilityReports` service to handle comparing two `a11y` artifacts and rendering the diff.

Secrets Scanner to support custom rules","description":"### Problem to solve\nUsers are constrained to use the secrets rules we provide which is limited and does not cover many use cases like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210496. Instead we should give users the ability to define what secrets they want to search. This can be done by creating our own rule config and translating it into the custom rules we have now or we could use the gitleaks config toml -- some examples of that [here](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/tree/master/examples).\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\nA great example is this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210496. The user wanted to make sure the secrets analyzer picks up passwords in [JDBC connection strings](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html). We could hardcode the rule into the secrets analyzer or we could let the user define their own rules which would include the ability to whitelist, resulting in less false positives. \n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd similar support as [SAST Custom Rules - Passthrough Scanner Configuration ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235382https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235382) to the [secrets analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets) analyzer. This would allow a user to define a gitleaks.toml embedded in `.gitlab/secret-detection-ruleset.toml` or in a file with the location defined in the `.gitlab/secret-detection-ruleset.toml`. The biggest difference with this and the old proposal is that this would be an override rather than additive to the current [secrets analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets) rules.\n\nSupport through MRs to files in project repositories is the only addition method supported. Adding this capability to a Configuration UI is out of scope for this issue.\n\n### Old Proposal\n\n* Allow customers to provide a toml file declaring rules in the same format as [gitleaks.toml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/scanner/gitleaks/gitleaks.toml).\n* Add variable (or variables) allowing customers to declare where additional rules are defined. \n  * Initial support is limited to additional rules provided as part of the project being built.\n* Customer-provided rules would be additive to the rules provided by the secrets scanner.\n  * If customers provide rules whose description matches one provided by secrets, the customer provided rule replaces it.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\nWe should update the SAST documentation and explain how the rule config works.\n\n### Links /

Check out the [Performance Tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance)\n1. Run the specific test with the `run-k6` command. For example against the 50k environment you would run this following from the project root: `./run-k6 -e environments/50k.json -o 60s_1000rps.json -t api_v4_projects_issues.js`. You will need an ACCESS_TOKEN for this endpoint as well.\n1. If you're seeking to run the test against your own environment the [Tool's documentation has details on how to achieve this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/blob/master/docs/k6.md).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe results above show that the Issues List API has a P90 of 1018.05ms. This was tested on our 50k Reference Architecture with a RPS target of 1000/s. It targeted our own [`gitlabhq`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance-data#gitlab-performance-test-framework-data) project that has 7k issues.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAs per our [new incoming performance targets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26033) this endpoint is slightly above our third tier target of 1000ms. Task is to improve the endpoint's performance to meet our performance target (\u003c500ms).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-16T14:07:36.168Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T00:19:16.171Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T00:19:16.142Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"labels":["Deliverable","Quality:performance-issues","api","backend","bug::performance","customer","devops::plan","group::project management","missed-deliverable","missed:13.8","performance-refinement","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"}],"author":{"id":4477602,"username":"niskhakova","name":"Nailia Iskhakova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477602/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/niskhakova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"user_notes_count":55,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211373","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211373","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211373/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211373/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211373","relative":"#211373","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211373"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32038207,"iid":211369,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow broadcast placeholders only on notifications","description":"With BroadcastMessages https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25925 we added the ability to add placeholders to broadcast messages.

Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-16T12:53:05.145Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:55:00.847Z","closed_at":"2020-07-13T11:54:37.190Z","closed_by":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","backend","devops::create","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.1","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"}],"author":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211360","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211360","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211360/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211360/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211360","relative":"#211360","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211360"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2214,"epic":{"id":15108,"iid":2214,"title":"[MVC 1] Group-level wiki - Support one wiki at group level","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2214","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32032261,"iid":211357,"project_id":278964,"title":"API endpoint to get the GPG signature of a commit always returns 404","description":"### Summary\n\nAPI endpoint to get the GPG signature of a commit always returns `404 GPG Signature Not Found` even for signed and verified commits.

Besides, it has to be scoped for users. Therefore, instead of checking if the feature flag is enabled or not (`Feature.enabled?(:snippet_multiple_files)`), we will check if the feature flag is enabled for specific users (`Feature.enabled?(:snippet_multiple_files, user)`). \r\n\r\nFor the MVP we limited the number of files that can be present in the repository to 1. Now that we're allowing multiple files, we have to raise that limit to 10 files.\r\n\r\nWe need to update the constant [`MAX_FILE_COUNT`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/snippet.rb#L20) to 10. Because constants are loaded and cannot be changed in staging or prod, we need to create a method (with a user as the argument) that will be the one checking the feature flag and returning the proper value. \r\n\r\nIt will be basically a matter of:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Snippet\r\n  MAX_FILE_COUNT = 1\r\n  NEW_MAX_FILE_COUNT = 10\r\n\r\n  def max_file_count(user)\r\n    Feature.enabled?(:snippet_multiple_files, user) ? NEW_MAX_FILE_COUNT : MAX_FILE_COUNT\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe need to update the call to the check `Checks::PushFileCountCheck` inside [`Gitlab::GitAccessSnippet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/git_access_snippet.rb#L109) to call this new method (passing the user) instead of calling the constant directly.\r\n\r\nOnce we remove the feature flag we can safely set `MAX_FILE_COUNT` to the new limit and call the constant.\r\n\r\n### Testing Activity\r\n\r\n@fjsanpedro:\r\n* Check/update spec `spec/lib/gitlab/checks/push_file_count_check_spec.rb`\r\n* Check new method that returns the limit based on the feature flag\r\n* Different tests in the specs for Gitlab::GitAccessSnippet to test the new behavior\r\n\r\n@vij:\r\n* Update existing test to cover support for multiple files\r\n\r\n@a_luna:\r\n* API endpoints continue to work well with one file snippets (current coverage)\r\n* API endpoints should return multi-file snippets as well\r\n\r\n\r\n### MR Breakdown\r\n@fjsanpedro:\r\n* 1 MR to adapt the constant and the related classes that use it along with the corresponding specs\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-16T10:32:23.482Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T07:07:02.165Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T07:55:50.674Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","backend-weight::1","devops::create","group::editor","quad-planning::complete-no-action","sec-planning::no-action","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211349","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211349","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211349/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/211349/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#211349","relative":"#211349","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#211349"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2829,"epic":{"id":28402,"iid":2829,"title":"Snippets with Multiple Files","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2829","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32024544,"iid":211339,"project_id":278964,"title":"Forward deployment  - warn users on \"Retry\"","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs of Gitlab 12.9, when a deployment job fails because a newer deployment was deployed first, the following error message shows up for the failed job.

The user doesn't notice the tabs and doesn't consider these options before creating the new project. This problem is exaggerated by the fact that, once the project is created, it is no longer possible to apply a template or perform an import.\n2. The user may notice the tabs but may assume that they will still have a chance to apply a template or an import, given that the tabs pattern looks a lot like one that may \"walk\" the user from tab to tab before the project is finally created. \nSimilar to an online checkout experience. See the example image below:\n![image](/uploads/758e69649471afab21d5b2cdfee58453/image.png)\n\n## The Solution\nA new UX flow that offers all 4 project creation options as equal choices and forces a conscious decision on which \"adventure\" to choose.\n\nAdditional solution discovery of this flow: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25647\n\n## Solution Validation\n* [x] Create solution

As such there have been no community contributions.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\nAs noted in the [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/30/new-features-to-core/) features are priced to the user most likely to be a champion for the feature. As we think about the features in the [Code Quality](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html) feature it is clear that the MR widget that details improvements and degradations in code quality associated with the merge are likely to be used and championed by the individual user. As such this feature belongs in the ~\"Category:DevOps Score\"  tier.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMove the MR Widget functionality from the ~\"GitLab Starter\" to the ~\"GitLab Core\" tier. Leave the Full Code Quality report in the ~\"GitLab Starter\" tier.\n\nOnly the ~frontend code needs to be moved for this.\n\n1. Create a `app/assets/javascripts/reports/code_quality` folder to contain the core code quality.\n1. Create a `code_quality_report.vue` file in the above directory. In this file we will render the `\u003creport-section\u003e` that [is found in the `mr_widget_options` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a8217a61446851dee495061d3ad8237e656eea61/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/mr_widget_options.vue#L276).\n1. Create a store to fetch the code quality reports for the base path and head path, which we will pass into the component from the core `mr_widget_options` component.\n1. Add the comparison to the store [which currently exists in the `mr_widget_store`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a8217a61446851dee495061d3ad8237e656eea61/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/stores/mr_widget_store.js#L110).\n1. Create the specs for the new `code_quality_report.vue` and store.\n1. Remove the specs [from the `mr_widget_store_spec`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a8217a61446851dee495061d3ad8237e656eea61/ee/spec/frontend/vue_mr_widget/stores/mr_widget_store_spec.js#L18).\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nUpdate the [Code Quality Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html) to better explain what parts of this feature are in each tier.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nRisk for activity like this is typically centered around authorization, however since this feature is being moved to core and thus available to every user, risk in this area is minimal.\n\n* movement and execution of the existing unit tests should be sufficient\n* `package-and-qa` is not required\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nUsers of GitLab free can see the Code Quality MR Widget after this change is live.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\nSee the Proposal above, this is moving to ~\"GitLab Core\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nNo.\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-13T17:33:35.959Z","updated_at":"2021-06-15T09:19:41.983Z","closed_at":"2020-07-20T17:34:45.462Z","closed_by":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"labels":["Category:Code Quality","Deliverable","GitLab Core","Verify::P1","devops::verify","direction","documentation","frontend","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.1","quad-planning::complete-action","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"}],"author":{"id":5379503,"username":"xli1","name":"Xiaohe Li","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5379503/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xli1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":45,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212499","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/212499","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/212499/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/212499/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#212499","relative":"#212499","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#212499"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"},{"id":32394562,"iid":212332,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move features to core: \"Service Desk\"","description":"## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the Service Desk feature is a feature in the Premium edition of GitLab.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we've concluded that the Service Desk is an underutilized feature in Premium due to its current maturity.

There are too many changes to effectively use a feature flag, although there is one defined, `:graphql_interpeter`.\n\nFor now we will use the following process:\n\n1. Main integration branch will be `bw-graphql-interpreter`\n1. All new MRs that cannot be included in `master` should target the integration branch `bw-graphql-interpreter`\n1. If a change in the code is compatible with `master`, then the change should be made there\n1. The integration branch will be rebased on `master` periodically, and downstream branches can then rebase on the integration branch\n\n---\n\n\nAs detailed in [GraphQL - Interpreter](https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/interpreter.html)\n\n\u003e GraphQL-Ruby 1.9.0 includes a new runtime module which you may use for your schema. Eventually, it will become the default.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nThe new runtime was added to address a few specific concerns:\n\n- Validation Performance: The previous runtime depended on a preparation step (GraphQL::InternalRepresentation::Rewrite) which could be very slow in some cases. In many cases, the overhead of that step provided no value.\n- Runtime Performance: For very large results, the previous runtime was slow because it allocated a new ctx object for every field, even very simple fields that didn’t need any special tracking.\n- Extensibility: Although the GraphQL specification supports custom directives, GraphQL-Ruby didn’t have a good way to build them.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nWe'll need to do this eventually, but it might take a little work.\n\nI'm not currently aware of any specific requirements for us to do this immediately.  But the longer we wait, the more code that is written and might be non-conformant.\n\nWe're currently upgrading to [1.10.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26096)\n\nNote, the MR for this issue should also revert https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29208 (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211478#note_320636547).\n\n/cc @cablett @.luke @reprazent\n\n---\n\nItems to do:\n\n- [x] remove all `resolve: -\u003e` procs from fields - this is [no longer supported](https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/interpreter.html#compatibility)\n- [x] convert our query analysers (`Gitlab::Graphql::QueryAnalyzers::RecursionAnalyzer` and `Gitlab::Graphql::QueryAnalyzers::LoggerAnalyzer`) to use `GraphQL::Analysis::AST` - these must be converted all at once\n- [x] update code in `spec/support/helpers/graphql_helpers.rb#resolve_field`\n\n  ```ruby\n    # TODO: This will need to change when we move to the interpreter - at that\n    # point we will call `field#resolve`\n    field.resolve_field(parent, arguments, query_ctx)\n

project details in the title section of the package detail user interface","description":"~\"frontend-weight::1\" \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe Package stage allows you to publish, consume and discover packages, all in one place. Users publish and pull packages using GitLab CI/CD, the command line or the GitLab API.\n\nThe problem is that we currently do not expose which project is responsible for generating a particular package. We can better enable them by providing this data at the top of the detail page.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Further details\n- If a package is not built using GitLab CI/CD, this information will not be displayed. \n- For projects hosted outside of GitLab, we will have to first tackle https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210141, which will pass that data to the front-end. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen a package has been published to the Package Registry using GitLab's pipelines, update the package detail header interface with the project, branch and commit, so that users can quickly find and navigate to the project responsible for generating the package.\n- Project, branch and commit should all link to their respective locations\n- We will display the project where the pipeline was run from and not the project which the package is associated with, which could be different).\n\nThe user interface design: \n![Update_the_header_of_the_package_detail_screen](/uploads/bbc1657fcc7e799249f6c1b01cf919d0/Update_the_header_of_the_package_detail_screen.png)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this change.\n\n### Documentation\n\nScreenshots associated with the package detail view should be updated in the documentation. \nDescriptions of the provided data should be added to the documentation.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\nn/a \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nImplementing the new design inclusive of additional metadata should improve our users' experience by enabling them to troubleshoot issues with relevant data. \n\n### Links /

Navigate to directory and run `conan create .` or any specific naming convention for package\n3. Run `conan upload conan-spdlog/* --test-folder=None` (Note required to have valid conan user from gitlab)\n4. Notice that conan_sources.tgz does not upload.\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nExport files are not uploaded along with the conan_package.tgz\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThere should be conan_export.tgz and conan_sources.tgz included.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nTrace of conan upload.

docker image to create a task in ECS","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nOur AWS image embed the scripts related to deployment to ECS. This should be two separate images: we should have one bare (base) image with only awscli in it, and another one that builds on the bare image and adds up ecs scripts.\n\nAlso, since images in `cloud-deploy` should be provider specific, these images should tagged `aws-cloud-deploy` instead of `cloud-deploy`, at build time.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe need to rename the existing image and splitting it into two images.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Update IssueLink's CreateService to check that `blocked_issues` is available if \"blocking/blocked\" link is being created.

Looking at the [MR for this feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24049/diffs), the feature is enabled by default, and when LDAP is enabled, [the `email` and `name` are set as read-only in the User model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.8.6-ee/app/models/user.rb#L1554).\n\nThis feature is [also enabled by default in the user update service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.8.6-ee/app/services/users/update_service.rb#L55), which causes the read-only attributes, email and name, to be removed from the update parameters. This prevents updating user names, even via LDAP user sync.\n\nThis feature's purpose wasn't to block changes via LDAP user sync. From the feature proposal description, it should allow the sync to update information, but just prevent updates via the GitLab UI. It is currently blocking \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Enable LDAP on a test instance running 12.8 and sync users\n2. Try to change a user's name in LDAP, and run a user sync, it doesn't change in GitLab\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUser information can't be updated in GitLab when LDAP is enabled, even through LDAP user sync.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe `ldap_readonly_attributes` feature should only effect edits in the GitLab UI. It should still allow changes via the LDAP User Sync (keeping LDAP the single source of truth).\n\n### Output of checks - I ran in GDK\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\nProxy:\t\trvm_proxy:\nCurrent User:\tblairlunceford\nUsing RVM:\tyes\nRVM Version:\t1.29.9\nRuby Version:\t2.6.5p114\nGem Version:\t3.0.6\nBundler Version:1.17.3\nRake Version:\t12.3.3\nRedis Version:\t5.0.7\nGit Version:\t2.25.0\nSidekiq Version:5.2.7\nGo Version:\tgo1.13.6 darwin/amd64\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:\t12.9.0-pre\nRevision:\t206bdcc7a2d\nDirectory:\t/Users/blairlunceford/gitlab-development/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab\nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL\nDB Version:\t10.11\nURL:\t\thttp://127.0.0.1:3000\nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://127.0.0.1:3000/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:\tssh://blairlunceford@127.0.0.1:2222/some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:\tno\nGeo:\t\tno\nUsing LDAP:\tyes\nUsing Omniauth:\tyes\nOmniauth Providers: google_oauth2\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:\t12.0.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default: \t/\nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/Users/blairlunceford/gitlab-development/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab-shell\nGit:\t\t/usr/local/bin/git\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

Then we can pass the data down with props, and bubble the events up with emitters.\n\nDoing this will allow us to create a new filter bar that uses all the GraphQL goodness for first class vulnerabilities and calls on the `\u003cdashboard-filter\u003e` component for all the interactivity.\n\n## Improvements\n\nThis approach not only makes moving to GraphQL easier, but it allows us to still use the same filter component on the pipeline dashboard so we wouldn't have to make any filter improvements to two different components.\n\n## Risks\n\nI can't forsee any risks here, but they sound like famous last words :sweat_smile: \n\n## Involved components\n\n- `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/filter.vue`\n- `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/filters.vue`\n\nAlong with the relevant test files.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-12T13:03:55.623Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T17:44:21.570Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T17:44:21.507Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","devops::govern","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::threat insights","vulnerability interaction","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":1125848,"username":"samdbeckham","name":"Sam Beckham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1125848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/samdbeckham"}],"author":{"id":1125848,"username":"samdbeckham","name":"Sam Beckham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1125848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/samdbeckham"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1125848,"username":"samdbeckham","name":"Sam Beckham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1125848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/samdbeckham"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210334","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/210334","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/210334/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/210334/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#210334","relative":"#210334","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#210334"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31915754,"iid":210332,"project_id":278964,"title":"Approximate counters are not working on gitlab.com","description":"### Summary\nWhile working on #208234 we noticed that approximate database counters are not working\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nCounters return -1\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nTo return the actual value\n\n### Output of checks\n\n```shell\nstart=Time.now; [Gitlab::UsageData.approximate_counts, Time.now - start]\nunknown OID 28: failed to recognize type of 'relfrozenxid'.
