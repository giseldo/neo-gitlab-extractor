[{"id":26316400,"iid":34975,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor out `Plan` details from `Namespace` and `GitlabSubscription`","description":"## Summary\n\n`Namespace` and `GitlabSubscription` models both handle a lot of details from `Plan` especially by inspecting `Plan`'s constants. \n\nThis is a Feature Envy issue that causes a lot of changes to be made or checked when something changes in `Plan`. E.g. recently we made some changes to introduce an explicit \"free plan\" record and changes leaked into related models. We should instead have `Plan`'s collaborators to use class/instance methods rather than constants.\n\n## Improvements\n\n`Plan` model is very small today but some domain logic related to it is scattered around models. We are also seeing some knowledge duplication between `Plan::ALL_HOSTED_PLANS` and `Namespace::PLANS` which violates the SSOT principle.\n\nSome refactorings:\n\n* `GitlabSubscription#has_a_paid_hosted_plan?` could use `plan.paid_hosted?` instead of comparing strings with `plan_name`.\n* `GitlabSubscription#upgradable?` could use `plan.upgradable?` instead of being coupled to `plan_name != Plan::PAID_HOSTED_PLANS[-1]`\n* `GitlabSubscription#plan_code=` could use `Plan.for_name(name)` returning a `Plan.free` if `name.nil?`\n* `GiltabSubscription.with_a_paid_hosted_plan` should instead merge a `Plan.paid_hosted` scope instead of dealing with `Plan`'s details\n\n* `Namespace#*_plan?` should be moved to `Plan` and define a delegation to `Namespace#actual_plan`\n* `Namespace#eligible_for_trial?` should use `actual_plan.eligible_for_trial?` rather than implementing this `Plan`'s policy itself.\n* `Namespace#trial_expired?` should simply delegate to `actual_plan.free?` instead of `actual_plan_name == Plan::FREE`\n* `Namespace#plan=` could use `Plan.for_name(name)`. However, we have the same code in `GitlabSubscription#plan_code=` but this instance does not default to `free` plan. Is this expected?  Is it a bug? Seems like the should work exactly the same now that we have `Plan.free` as explicit record. This code should then by DRYed.\n\n## Risks\n\nBecause we are refactoring code around `Plan` we need to be careful not to introduce bugs as it will have direct impact in customer's experience especially for billed customers. \n\nI think this refactoring will consolidate policies around `Plan`, hence reduce changes of introducing bugs in the long term.\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\nNeed to check how good test coverage is around these 3 involved models.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-25T11:42:33.940Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T14:29:40.815Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T14:29:40.648Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio

This API path currently returns different types of objects depending on the `first_class_vulnerabilities` feature flag state: [`Vulnerability`](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/488d64ff2f904332e34c4fd50780e8ca22fcc0c7/ee/app/models/vulnerability.rb) instances in case `first_class_vulnerabilities` is ***enabled*** and [`Vulnerabilities::Occurrence`](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/10242-move-old-vulns-api-to-vuln-findings/ee/app/models/vulnerabilities/occurrence.rb) instances otherwise.\n\n`first_class_vulnerabilities` feature flag controls the availability of the upcoming [MVC Standalone Vulnerability objects](/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13561) (aka *First-class Vulnerabilities*) functionality.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nThere was a decision to reserve the `/projects/:id/vulnerabilities` for serving the `Vulnerability` instances only regardless of the `first_class_vulnerabilities` feature flag state. The current implementation of it is moved to `/projects/:id/vulnerability_findings` API path.\n\nThus, the `projects/:id/vulnerabilities` will be consistent in terms of responding only with `Vulnerability` objects when `first_class_vulnerabilities` feature flag is enabled and with `404 Not Found` otherwise.\n\nInitially, [this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/16468) was planned to be covered with a feature flag and released together with #13561. This decision makes this change immediate breaking change for the current Vulnerabilities API consumers.\n\nTo be noted:\n\n* current Vulnerabilities API is in the Alpha stage and the warning about possible breaking changes [is explicit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/vulnerabilities.html)\n* this API is used by GitLab frontend, the corresponding changes [were made](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19029/diffs#faf583c25111ab505d50042c45f41694740e54f1_11_11) to switch the API path used\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThe permissions for the Vulnerability Findings API will be the exact copy of the current Vulnerabilities API: a user would have to be able to `read_project_security_dashboard` to access the Vulnerability Findings API.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] Move the contents of the [Vulnerabilities API docs page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/vulnerabilities.html) to the newly created Vulnerability Findings API docs page\n- [x] On that page, rename all mentions of the \"vulnerabilities\" to be \"vulnerability findings\"\n- [x] Leave a renaming notice with a link on the former Vulnerabilities API docs page\n- [x] Rename the Vulnerabilities to Vulnerability Findings on the [API resources list](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html#api-resources) page\n\n### Testing\n\nAPI endpoints' tests are updated for both `projects/:id/vulnerabilities` and `projects/:id/vulnerability_findings` to reflect these changes.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nThe `projects/:id/vulnerabilities` is consistent in terms of responding only with `Vulnerability` objects when `first_class_vulnerabilities` feature flag is enabled and with `404 Not Found` otherwise.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-23T16:41:21.152Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T20:38:27.521Z","closed_at":"2019-12-19T20:38:27.066Z","closed_by":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","backend","backend-weight::1","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::secure","frontend","group::static analysis","missed:12.5"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"}],"author":{"id":3337413,"username":"vzagorodny","name":"Victor Zagorodny","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/56410d67aa18e03b13e1585d436bf313?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vzagorodny"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34810","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":4},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34810","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34810/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34810/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34810","relative":"#34810","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34810"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26237099,"iid":34786,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix feature flag check for productivity analytics","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18754 we have enabled the PA feature flag by default, however we missed setting the `default_enabled` flag for the routes.

This happens whenever the scan involves installing the project dependencies, and listing them using [pipdeptree](https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree). In that case, it's as if the project depends on `pipdeptree`, even if it's not the case.\n\nThis impacts Python projects using pip or setuptools. Pipenv projects are not impacted by this.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis problem was surfaced when connecting [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) to the [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db), as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/14630. The integration required to add some dependencies to the gemnasium-python project, and these were artifically added to the dependencies of the scanned projects. See [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/merge_requests/29#note_231822528).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- create a Python project with a `requirements.txt` or a `Pipfile` but no lock file\n- enable Dependency Scanning for this project\n- inspect the dependency list\n\n### Example Project\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/blob/8ea559e2b16acc49a49d8fe3bcb48cd6226c729a/qa/expect/gl-dependency-scanning-report.json#L526\n\nThis was surfaced when working on [gemnasium-python!29](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/merge_requests/29), see [failing pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/pipelines/90798870).\n\n### Proposal\n\nUse `--user` install option for `pip` and `setuptools` when building projects. And the `-u` option when running analysis via `pipdeptree`.\n\nThis has been successfully tested with both `pip` and `setuptools` using the following projects:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/python-setuptools/main/setup.py\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/python-pip/no-pillow/requirements.txt\n\n```\n# python setup.py install --user\n# pip install pipdeptree\n# pipdeptree -u\ntest-project==0.0.1\n  - Django [required: ==1.11.3, installed: 1.11.3]\n    - pytz [required: Any, installed: 2021.3]\n  - docutils [required: ==0.13.1, installed: 0.13.1]\n  - requests [required: ==2.5.3, installed: 2.5.3]\n```\n\nPlease note that the project itself is listed, as this is already the case.

See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/200\n- Leverage `pipdeptree --exclude` to exclude `pipdeptree`, `pip`, and other package managers.

Choose a feature flag that defaults to \"on\", like [`productivity_analytics`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18754) or [`productivity_analytics_scatterplot_enabled`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commit/9bed4094249a).\n1. Attempt to disable the feature with `Feature.disable`.\n1. See that the feature is still enabled.\n\nNote: This happens whether you have previously run `Feature.enable` or not.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe feature still appears after you call `Feature.disable`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe feature disappears after you call `Feature.disable`\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nThe Flipper gem is not compatible with feature flags that default to \"on\". At least with its ActiveRecord adapter, [calling `disable` destroys the database record](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/master/lib/flipper/adapters/active_record.rb#L81). When there is no record, the default applies. And for these features the default is \"on\". For Flipper to be compatible with feature flags that default to \"on\", it would need to modify the database record with a `value` of \"false\" instead of destroying it.\n\nIf you manually update the `feature_gates` record with a `value` of \"false\" (instead of calling `Feature.disable`) then the feature is hidden as desired.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- Eliminate feature flags that default to \"on\" (easier)\n- Revert feature flags that default to \"on\", to default to \"off\" (easier)\n- Customize the Flipper gem, or our usage of it (harder)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-22T20:16:19.502Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T14:58:17.133Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T20:53:46.991Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["devops::manage","group::optimize","priority::2","severity::4","type::bug"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34725","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34725","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34725/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34725/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34725","relative":"#34725","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34725"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26207981,"iid":34723,"project_id":278964,"title":"Visually Differentiate Blocked Issues","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\n*This is a follow on to issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/2035 which is the MVC for blocking issues support*\n\nWhen looking at issue boards, it would be nice to have a visual cue that an issue is currently blocked.\n\n\u003e As a product manager who uses issue boards, I would like to be able to quickly understand which issues are blocked to enable me to effectively work to unblock / plan issues.\n\n\u003e As a development team lead using issue boards, I would like to easily understand which issues which are ready for development but are blocked so I can effectively schedule work.\n\n\u003e As a software developer, I need to be able to quickly see which issues are blocked so I can avoid expending unnecessary effort investigating such issues.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Being able to easily differentiate blocked issues would prevent the user from having to click on each issue and look at the blocking issues.\n\nA small icon could be used to indicate `blocked`, similar to what is shown below.\n\n**Icon Indication:**\n\n![Icon Indication](/uploads/e5e2271db1f52b5c359b20f1789bf8a2/image.png)\n\n**Icon:**\n\n`issue-block`\n\n\n**Specs:**\n \nhttps://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/alexis/%2334723-visualize-blocked-issues-spec-previews/\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nI would anticipate no additional permissions or security concerns.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nDocumentation surrounding [issue boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html) would need to be updated to explain this feature.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nThis would be a ~\"GitLab Starter\" feature to align with blocking issue support.\n\n### Links /

Policy tab was added, but maintainer is unable to edit/add policy from the policies section.\n\nContext: This issue is based on discovery work done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12941. We now have a dedicated [license compliance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13582) section, that shows licenses detected in a project per the [license scan](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/license_compliance/). Currently, adding a license and classification policy is done in Project\u003eSettings\u003eCI/CD\u003eLicense Compliance. This means the licenses detected are visible to all users, but the policies are not (unless a newly detected license appears in an MR).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* Compliance Role wants to see that they are following policies that have been set, edit policies as needed, and set policies for unclassified licenses.\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\\\n* Legal and/or person responsible for orgs compliance\n\n### Further details\n\n* Upon completion of this MVC, the former LC section located in settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e LC will be removed\n* Next MVC will be to allow user to apply a policy to a license already detected in the project https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33870 \n\n### Proposal\n| Maintainer UI | Adding license and policy |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![maintainer](/uploads/4a0d293029428b1c6983d4d2fd7a3060/maintainer.png) | ![addpolicy2](/uploads/ab41c49e73450e92a16e9215f803c861/addpolicy2.png) |\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* Developer view may view policies, but can't adjust them\n* Maintainer may view/add/edit/delete policies\n* Public projects policy section is not visible to non-project participants (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33659)\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [License compliance foundations document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHhT75dHpP4eYBiMxrDtNkSfQdwpsnugT0wa0Tqm9wk/edit?usp=sharing)\n* Updated classification names issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12937\n* Update docs https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/license_compliance/#project-policies-for-license-compliance with additional way to see policies\n\n### Testing\n\nTBD\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* User navigates to this section when tasked with adding a license policy\n* User is able to successfully add a license policy\n\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references\n* Discovery issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12941\n* Question for scoping: can

We need to consider a possible local repository so we can't just hardcode a link to the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db project.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- update [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium); see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/80\n  - introduce a new variable named `GEMNASIUM_DB_WEB_URL`, which defaults to the web URL of the [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) project; it's exposed as a CLI env var, and forced in the `Dockerfile`, just like `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL`\n  - change the functions of the `scanner` package so that they propagate the relative path of the YAML advisories in the `scanner.File` structs they return\n  - update the `VulnerabilityConverter.primaryIdentifier` method of the `convert` package, and forge the URL using `GEMNASIUM_DB_WEB_URL`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REF_NAME`, and the relative path of the YAML advisory \n  - release new version\n- upgrade the `gemnasium` dependency\n  - update [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven); see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/54\n  - update [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python); see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/58","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-22T15:19:43.343Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T17:25:13.729Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T12:08:45.058Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::3","quad-planning::complete-no-action","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34694","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34694","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34694/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34694/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34694","relative":"#34694","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34694"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26198092,"iid":34689,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use .dataset instead of .getAttribute('data-FOO')","description":"Context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/18305#note_232553467\n\nCurrently, we use both `.dataset` and `.getAttribute('data-*')` when referencing HTML element data attributes.

GMA-group","description":"A [modification to this feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216987) was made apart from GMA and [released in 13.3](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/#prevent-forking-outside-a-group)\n\n## Problem\n\nTop-level groups using SAML SSO can [enforce the use of group managed accounts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/#group-managed-accounts) (GMA) to require users to create unique users that are tied to that specific group. These user accounts are used when SSOing into the group, and are tied to the email address received from the configured identity provider.\n\nGroup managed accounts were intended as a solution for enterprises on GitLab.com looking for more control over user activity. One gap for these enterprises is the use of personal projects; a personal project could be forked or cloned in a personal namespace, outside of the control of a group's owner, and accidentally expose valuable code. \n\nSome organizations prefer to have the group be the only place that a user's able to interact with projects associated with the enterprise. By keeping them in the group, they're able to assert control over them and audit activity.\n\n## Proposal\n\nFor organizations using group managed accounts, a group Owner should be able to toggle whether or not group managed accounts are able to create forks outside of the group. \n* When enabled, creating a fork should only be allowed if the fork is created inside the group associated with the group managed account.\n* When disabled, a group managed account should be able to fork anywhere.\n\nThis option should be enabled by default when enabling group managed accounts (changing behavior of existing groups is not desired).\n\nNote that this restriction would only apply to attempts to create new forks and won't affect any existing forks that are already in personal namespaces, which we should make clear in the documentation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-22T01:06:33.673Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T18:50:04.311Z","closed_at":"2020-02-20T08:29:18.122Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"labels":["backend","customer+","devops::manage","direction","estimation::needed","frontend","gitlab.com","group::authentication and authorization","missed:12.7","missed:12.8","planning priority","saml","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"user_notes_count":96,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34648","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34648","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34648/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/34648/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#34648","relative":"#34648","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#34648"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1785,"epic":{"id":11091,"iid":1785,"title":"Group SSO: Stability, Availability, and Security","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1785","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26174721,"iid":34643,"project_id":278964,"title":"Merge request does not show the correct changes when a collapsed diff is expanded","description":"### Summary\n\nThe issue is in the Merge Request \"Changes\" tab when viewing changes between some version and another version that is not the target branch. If a large the diff is collapsed, clicking the \"Click to expand it\" link does not display the correct diff. Instead of displaying the diff against the selected versions, it displays the diff against the target branch.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPush a change to an existing merge request that is large and causes the file to be shown as collapsed in the \"Changes\" tab. Then, in the \"Changes between\" drop-down boxes, select \"latest version\" in the first box, and whatever the prior version was in the second drop down box. You should see the large change that you just pushed as collapsed, with a \"Click to expand\" link shown to expand it. Click that link, and you will see that the diff shown is not the change that you just pushed. Instead, it includes changes all the way back to the target branch.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/kendall-rel/merge-request-test/merge_requests/1/diffs?diff_id=59645735\u0026start_sha=8d2a627fde194d8190d123b193ee58638935d0b9\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIn the link above, you'll see:\n\n![mr-before](/uploads/7194d4059809a30258fe4a2a9b34dfe0/mr-before.png)\n\nI've highlighted the count of lines changed. Notice that the total count for the selected \"Changes between\" versions matches the count for the file, which is correct because its the only file in the merge request. Click the \"Click to expand link\", and you'll see:\n\n![mr-after](/uploads/96c38983a6107561abea7adbb3baa720/mr-after.png)\n\nNotice that the total count for the selected \"Changes between\" versions is less than the count for the file. Also notice that diff shown for the file is not the diff between the selected \"Changes between\" versions. It is the diff between the latest version and the master branch.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAfter clicking the \"Click to expand link\", I expect to see a diff of the change between the selected \"Changes between\" versions.
