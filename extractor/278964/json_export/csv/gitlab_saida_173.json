These are `user-errors` (of interest\n   to the user, not necessarily caused by them), or `recoverable-errors`.\n\nThis has downsides - the most obvious, from looking at our front end code, is\nthat we never check for the second of these two error conditions. This means\nwe have brittle code which will cause reference errors when the update handlers\ntry to reach deeply into objects that do not exist. (for example, an update\nhandler may evaluate `data.mutationName.something.somethingElse`, which will\nfail with essentially a null-pointer exception on when there is no `something`\non the result.\n\nAdding the appropriate level of error handling gets tedious quickly, and\nmakes for messy code that obscures the logic.\n\n## Improvements\n\nWe should be much clearer amongst ourselves about what these errors mean, and\nwhen something is `non-recoverable` vs `recoverable`. This should be audited\nduring code-review on back-end MRs, and all front-end code must include tests for\nthe error states.\n\nThis is a documentation issue (we need to improve doc/development/api_graphql_styleguide.md)\nas well as a code-quality issue, where we need to hold ourselves to account about how errors\nare handled throughout the stack.\n\n## Involved components\n\nOur GraphQL mutations.\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] add section on errors to the mutations section of doc/development/api_graphql_styleguide.md.\n- [ ] create global error fragment\n- [ ] statically enforce its usage in every mutation\n- [ ] add a graphql reviewer category (similar to database)\n- [ ] have danger enforce that graphql MRs (touching code in `app/graphql` or touching `*.graphql` files) have a gitlab-ee~4133451 review\n\n/cc

This is no longer working, and makes Deploy Keys mostly unusable for our use case as they currently work.\n\n\u003e Today, we don't treat a deploy key as a machine user, but we evaluate the permission through the owner of the key. This is not an ideal architecture as users are usually registering SSH key as a machine user, which is detached from any user accounts.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\nSascha (Software Developer), Devon (DevOps Engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nWe used a Deploy Key to push updated `package.json` version to the `master` branch whenever a new version of our NPM package was released. Now, we either have to unprotect the `master` branch (allowing all developpers to push to `master`) or create a bogus/bot user that has the correct permissions. Unprotecting `master` is obvious why it is not a good idea, one simple reason that comes to mind is that it's easy to push commits on the wrong branch by mistake. Creating a CI/bot user will cost additional money, as we are on the silver plan, as well as adding user management overhead.\n\nOld proposal; \n\u003cdetails\u003e\nFor us, it would be fine if Deploy Keys could always push to protected branches. If there are concerns about this approach, I suggest that it's possible to allow Deploy Keys to push in either the settings for the deploy key or in the settings for the protected branches.\n \n* A Deploy Key currently has a \"Write access allowed\" setting. An additional setting could be added below: \"Write access to protected branches allowed\".\n* When setting protected branches, there could be an area next to \"Roles\" for deploy keys, that can be toggled on/off. It could simply say \"Allow Deploy Key access\".\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nIn this proposal, we're moving towards having an isolated permission model for deploy keys. Therefore, users can see the keys in the protected branches' interface. \n\n- Protected branches will rely on the access of the deploy key owner\n   - Deploy keys are able to push to protected branch if the owner does not have permission to do, but does have access to the project.\n   - When deploy keys are to be able to push the user is not made implicit with the same permission as this will cause unintended access.\n   - When a user is deleted/unassigned from a project the deploy keys will become unavailable.\n   - The workaround of the need for a bot/machine user account to not tie it to a real user account is known and deemed acceptable for now.\n- **At the project level: - protected branches ** The drop-down for `Allowed to deploy` will get an additional section dedicated to deploy keys: `Deploy keys`\n- Deploy keys section will feature an information hierarchy and architecture as depicted in the mockup.\n   - The only exception is that we show the deploy key title/name instead of the fingerprint including the first few characters of the MD5 signature as seen at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30769#note_381468877\n   - Ellipsing should happen if the content exceeds the width of the dropdown menu\n- After this change, all of the users have to manually add a deploy key to the protected branch interface for giving it write permission. This means this ~regression requires user action after it's shipped (the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/44839 will help communicate this). \n- There will be an additional help text paragraph included in between the deploy keys tabs and the configuration UI with the copy: `Note: Deleting a deploy key might affect existing configurations.` as can be seen at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30769#note_379238690\n- Help text paragraphs `protected branches` section changes to: \n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n**Protected Branches**\n\nKeep stable branches secure and force developers to use merge requests.\n\nBy default, protected branches`\u003clink\u003e` are designed to:\n\n* prevent their creation from everybody except Maintainers`\u003clink to permissions\u003e`\n* prevent pushes from everybody except Maintainers\n* prevent anyone from force pushing to the branch\n* prevent anyone from deleting the branch\n\nYou can change the defaults to allow specific users or deploy keys`\u003clink\u003e` to access protected branches.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n| Mockup ([Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/qZWFzTBF0ZJbt1CkyV8nAY/30769?node-id=0%3A1))  |\n| --- |\n| ![image](/uploads/45e50b491b0bddaecbf1cb9af965f158/image.png) |\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/65715 (Documentation)\n\n### Scoped off\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223750 We eliminate the difference between CE/EE, [allowing to restrict by users, in addition to by roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html#restricting-push-and-merge-access-to-certain-users-starter)\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223748 Update \"protected environments\" section in a similar way\n\n### Merge request scoping\n\nMR breakdown:\n\n* ~database change and ~api update (for autocompletion) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34875 -

does not show epic when it's created via API call","description":"### Summary\n\nI have started creating an end-to-end test that will check if an epic with start date equal to the current date, and due date equal to one month ahead is shown in the roadmap view, and to save some time, I'm creating the epic via an API call, but when visiting the roadmap view, the epic is not there.\n\n\u003e Note: If I manually update one of the dates (start date or due date) to a different date, and then I visit the roadmap view, the epic is displayed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWith the GDK EE environment up-to-date and running, on the `master` branch, from the `qa/` directory, run the following command:\n\n`QA_DEBUG=true CHROME_HEADLESS=false bundle exec bin/qa Test::Instance::All http://localhost:3001 qa/specs/features/ee/browser_ui/2_plan/epic/roadmap_spec.rb`\n\n\u003e Here is now the test looks like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/qa/qa/specs/features/ee/browser_ui/2_plan/epic/roadmap_spec.rb\n\n#### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe epic is not shown in the roadmap view.\n\n#### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen visiting the roadmap view the epic should be displayed.\n\n#### Additional steps:\n\n1 - Access the just created epic and edit one of the dates (start date or due date) to a different date than the one set\n\n2 - Visit the roadmap view\n\n\u003e Notice that now the epic is correctly displayed.\n\n### Relevant screenshots\n\n![Screenshot_2019-08-07_at_12.07.22](/uploads/d5c3300118b86380d69829e897d1edf1/Screenshot_2019-08-07_at_12.07.22.png)\n\n![Screenshot_2019-08-07_at_12.04.56](/uploads/0952097ba0dc681418c4ee12948cceeb/Screenshot_2019-08-07_at_12.04.56.png)\n\nCc

[`BaseCountService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/app/services/base_count_service.rb) for a possible implementation of counter caching (example:

If no recipe exists, 404 is returned, otherwise a hash of the recipe files and manifest are returned:\n\n```json\n{ \n  \"conanmanifest.txt\": \"http://localhost:3001/{download_path_to_file_on_remote}\",\n  \"conanfile.py\": \"http://localhost:3001/{download_path_to_file_on_remote}\"\n}\n```\n\n2) If the files from the remote do not exist locally, they are downloaded using the returned urls\n\n3) `recipe snapshot` api call checks the recipe files md5 signatures returning a collection of md5 hashes. If the recipe does not exist an empty hash is returned.\n\n```json\n{ \n  \"conanmanifest.txt\": \"{md5 hash of file on remote}\",\n  \"conanfile.py\": \"{md5 hash of file on remote}\"\n}\n```\n\n4) Client compares the returned hashes to diff the new recipe files with the existing ones in order to know which files it needs to request uploads for.\n\n5) `recipe upload urls` request is made supplying the api with a list of files that need to be uploaded (for a new package, it will be all files, for existing, it will be based on the diff performed). The client will request with a body like this:\n```json\n{\"conanfile.py\": 1762, \"conanmanifest.txt\": 58}\n```\n\nThe remote will respond with the upload urls for each file. The file size is given by the client so the remote can decide if it needs to offload the upload to a different service (all our uploads will be handled by workhorse so this should not matter, however, we should place limits on filesizes). The remote will return:\n```json\n{ \n  \"conanmanifest.txt\": \"http://localhost:3001/{upload_path_for_file_on_remote}\",\n  \"conanfile.py\": \"http://localhost:3001/{upload_path_for_file_on_remote}\"\n}\n```\n\n6) The client will now use the returned upload urls to upload each file using the `upload file` endpoint.\n\n7) A similar process is followed for the package files and the package endpoints.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-06T17:07:55.467Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T11:31:28.387Z","closed_at":"2019-12-05T22:04:57.779Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","devops::package","group::package registry","missed-deliverable","missed:12.3","missed:12.4","missed:12.5","package:active","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13345","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13345","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13345/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13345/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#13345","relative":"#13345","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#13345"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2273,"epic":{"id":15543,"iid":2273,"title":"GitLab Conan Repository","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2273","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23549125,"iid":13344,"project_id":278964,"title":"Private group EPIC info visible for former sub group owners","description":"**[HackerOne report #666892](https://hackerone.com/reports/666892)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-08-03, assigned to `jmatos_bgtvf`:\n\nDev issue: https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ee/issues/396\nSecurity issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/issues/30\n\n### Summary\n\nHello,\n\nSub group EPICs can be added as child EPIC to parent group EPIC. When a sub group EPIC contains the ancestor EPICs, they are visible on right side menu.\n\nThe problem with this is, This section is still available when sub group owner moves the sub group to their own private group.\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \n1. Create a private group named  `MainGroup` with only `User1` as owner and no other members  \n2. Create a sub group named `SubGroup` inside it with additional owner `User2`  \n3. Create EPIC in both `MainGroup` and `SubGroup` too  \n4. Put `SubGroup` EPIC as Child EPIC to `MainGroup`  EPIC.  \n5. As `User2` is owner of `SubGroup` , he can transfer this group to his own group.  So, `User2` transfers this group to his own group.  \n6. By doing this, `User2` doesnt have any access to Private group `MainGroup`  of `User1`   \n7. However, when `User2` visits the EPIC of the `SubGroup` (in newly moved group), he still see the `Ancestor` EPIC from `User1` Private `MainGroup`.\n\n![Screenshot_2019-08-04_at_01.02.07.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/62d35639-604d-4227-ba1f-e0f8ae3771f0/Screenshot_2019-08-04_at_01.02.07.png)\n\n8. So if `User1` changes the names of  EPIC in  `MainGroup`. , `User2` Still able to see the new names of such EPICs. Also `User1` can not do anything about this as he cant see  EPIC added from  `SubGroup` in his `MainGroup` EPIC.\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNew EPIC names visible to former owner of sub group if group is transferred by owner\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nEPIC info should not be available in such scenarios\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too!\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nNew EPIC titles are available to former owners of sub group if they themselves transfers the group\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [Screenshot_2019-08-04_at_01.02.07.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/62d35639-604d-4227-ba1f-e0f8ae3771f0/Screenshot_2019-08-04_at_01.02.07.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-06T16:48:36.525Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T15:16:24.125Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T07:52:13.084Z","closed_by":{"id":508743,"username":"jarka","name":"Jarka Košanová","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3931dae84deb01d2881e4909077b8dbe?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jarka"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","group::product planning","priority::4","security","severity::4"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":508743,"username":"jarka","name":"Jarka Košanová","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3931dae84deb01d2881e4909077b8dbe?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jarka"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":508743,"username":"jarka","name":"Jarka Košanová","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3931dae84deb01d2881e4909077b8dbe?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jarka"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13344","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13344","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13344/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13344/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#13344","relative":"#13344","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#13344"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23549021,"iid":13343,"project_id":278964,"title":"Issues \u003e Analytics display different issues created","description":"### Summary\n\nInto Analytics page \u003eIssues created per month shown different amount of issues when you press enter into search bar.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

pipeline leaked to unauthorized users via blocking merge request feature","description":"**[HackerOne report #667408](https://hackerone.com/reports/667408)** by `xanbanx` on 2019-08-05, assigned to `jmatos_bgtvf`:\n\n### Summary\n\nGitLab allows for public and internal projects to restrict the visibility of pipelines to project members only. Then, only project members should have access to the pipeline information.\n\nGitLab recently added the blocking merge request feature. This feature can be used to leak the head pipeline thus bypassing the access control.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a public project, set Pipelines visibility to project members only, and disable public pipelines  \n2. Push some code and create a first merge request  \n3. Create a second merge request and add the first MR as a blocking MR  \n4. As a unauthenticated user visit the following page: `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject-name\u003e/merge_requests/2/widget.json`\n\nThis returns the JSON data for the merge

for indicating that a predecessor job is optional in a DAG","description":"### Release post\n\nWith the implementation of our directed acyclic graph (DAG) in GitLab CI we introduce a syntax that makes a job run only if a different job finish its run (without waiting to its own stage). however if the DAG syntax is combined with rules syntax - which detairmine if a job will gets added to a pipeline there can be a situation where a job is waiting for a job that does not exists in the pipeline (because it did not got added to the pipeline), this will cause the pipeline to fail only on run. In this release we are adding the optional keyword to any DAG job which will process the pipline with the condition that `If the optional job exists, then wait for it, otherwise run as part of the chosen stage`, this will allow you to saifly combined the very popular rules syntax with the growing popularity of the DAG concept \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWe are implementing an MVC for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) execution model in GitLab CI via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47063#note_198535521, which introduces the following syntax for marking a job as running after another job, without waiting for its own stage:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  needs: [test]\n  ...\n```\n\nA \"smart default\" we chose was for anything indicated as _needed_ by a job was in fact needed, and if the job did not exist (likely because it didn't match to the pipeline's `only/except` rules), that it would also not run. However, there are some unusual cases where the intent would be:\n\n`If job _x_ exists, then wait for it, otherwise run as part of the chosen stage`\n\nThis is not possible with the current syntax, and this limits usefulness of a whole DAG feature significantly. Due to other limitations teams are often forced to duplicate jobs, this in turn causes snowball effect for DAG, where there is currently no way to express `needs: [A or B]`. Allowing to specify job in `needs` which might not exist in the given pipeline makes gitlab-ci.yml files more concise.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe can make this easier by allowing you to specify that the job should go ahead if the job it refers to does not exist:\n\n```yaml\njob1:\n  needs: [a, b, c, { job: d, optional: true }, e, f]\n```\nThe default value, when not explicitly overridden, is `false` (which is the current behavior today).\n\nNote that this should work in concert with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233876 in cases where both are provided.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

[x] UX/Product: Analyse, flag inconsistencies and define the new expectations \n- [x] Engineering: Define permission conventions to apply when adding/updating a feature\n- [x] Engineering: Update the permissions based on the new expectations\n  - Create new missing policies\n  - Update existing policies\n  - Update docs\n\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] make sure public documentation about permission is up to date: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n- [x] create developer-oriented documentation about which permissions we use and how to add new ones\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- clean description of our permissions and how to add/update them.\n- fewer issues regarding permissions bug or inconsistencies\n\n\n### New

For example for design app (sorry, my view might be incomplete, since it mostly based on reviewing !14648):\n* at the very start we need only amount of designs for latest version\n* when switched to discussions tab we need to prepopulate versions list and list of designs for specific version \n* loading separate design right now does not have separate query, so we still need to fetch specific version (same like previous one)\n\nIt's really important to split this to small chunks as soon as possible since adding new functionality will most likely require more and more code to maintain

`needs:` (DAG) to refer to a job in the same stage","description":"### Release notes\n\nThe Needs keyword reduces cycle time, as it ignores stage ordering and runs jobs without waiting for others to complete, which speeds up your pipelines, previously needs could only be created between jobs to different stages (job depends on another job in a different stage), In this release, we've removed this limitation, so you can define a needs relationship between any job you desire, as a result, you can now create a complete CI/CD pipeline without using stages with implicit needs between jobs, so you can define less verbose pipeline which runs even faster.\n\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWith the current implementation of the directed acyclic graph, the user has to help the scheduler a bit by defining stages for jobs, and only passing dependencies between stages. That can get complicated for large DAGs. Right now, users can deal with this by topologically sorting the DAG and greedily adding artificial “stage1”, “stage2”, etc. labels (or even one stage name per job). \n\n### Intended users\n\nIndividual contributor automators\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe will allow to depend on the jobs within the same stage instead of this being prevented by an error. \n\nFor now, we are not making stages only a \"visualization hint\" since they are still part of processing. In the future we are considering making all pipeline processing DAG (just, by default without needs set, it will behave just like a stage-based pipeline). At that point it may make sense to more broadly revisit what stages mean in GitLab CI.\n\nIf a job `needs` another in the same stage, `dependencies` should be respected and it should wait (within the stage) to run until the job it needs is done. Then, fetch its dependencies and run itself.\n\n\n#### Limitations\n\n- Circular references will need to be detected and will still result in an error.\n- `dependencies:` will not be updated to support this (at least as part of this issue) separate from within the context of `needs` since non-DAG pipelines having dependencies on something in the same stage is undefined.\n- We don't yet have a plan to allow `needs:` to reference items in future stages. This is a more far out there case that could really become difficult to visualize, so we are not addressing it now. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-02T06:38:36.171Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T08:12:25.310Z","closed_at":"2021-08-12T09:16:10.945Z","closed_by":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","DEPRECATE_pipeline dag","Deliverable","GitLab Core","Product Vision FY20","backend","customer","devops::verify","direction","documentation","group::pipeline authoring","internal customer","quad-planning::ready","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"}],"author":{"id":2243533,"username":"jyavorska","name":"Jason Yavorska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2243533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jyavorska"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"user_notes_count":111,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":243,"downvotes":1,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30632","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30632","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30632/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/30632/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#30632","relative":"#30632","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#30632"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4136,"epic":{"id":91032,"iid":4136,"title":"Always process pipelines using DAG algorithm","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4136","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24700948,"iid":30626,"project_id":278964,"title":"Proof of concept of Themes in Theia with GitLab-UI components","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs follow up of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/56812, we still have some lingering questions that we need to find the answers to before we can understand the complexity of developing and customizing Theia's Web IDE, before we can have a final decision.\n\nThese are the questions we have that will impact the gitlab-ce~3412464 and gitlab-ce~2024184 understanding of how such future would look:\n\n* **How much control do we have over the UI?**  (relevant for gitlab-ce~2024184, too).\n   * What can we change and what we can't?\n   * Are we comfortable with those restrictions?\n* **How complex/time-consuming it is to develop an extension and/or plugin?** (knowing from the get-go that plugins are far less powerful, [per their docs](https://www.theia-ide.org/doc/authoring_plugins))\n* **If we develop an extension, how much will that hinder the upgrade path going forward?**\n\n\n\n\n### Intended users\n\nDevelopers and Designers will make use of the conclusions of this effort.\n\n### Further details\n\nBy answering these questions, we'll be much better equipped to understand the technical and experience aspects of a future Web IDE powered by Theia.\n\nThis will allow us to plan the way forward, should that decision be made.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis issue should include the following:\n\n1.

[Example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/jobs/264373446)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```bash\nDownloading artifacts for dependency_scanning (264373441)...\nDownloading artifacts from coordinator... ok        id=264373441 responseStatus=200 OK token=shvShpQx\nDownloading artifacts for container_scanning (264373442)...\nDownloading artifacts from coordinator... ok        id=264373442 responseStatus=200 OK token=W6r3xcQ9\nDownloading artifacts for license_management (264373443)...\nDownloading artifacts from coordinator... ok        id=264373443 responseStatus=200 OK token=s5yAq7D6\n$ apk update \u0026\u0026 apk add jq\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\nv3.9.4-100-g98f4966a45 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/main]\nv3.9.4-96-gd46d1b3369 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/community]\nOK: 9774 distinct packages available\n(1/2) Installing oniguruma (6.9.1-r0)\n(2/2) Installing jq (1.6-r0)\nExecuting busybox-1.29.3-r10.trigger\nOK: 7 MiB in 16 packages\n$ jq -e --argfile a ./qa/expect/$REPORT --argfile b ./$REPORT -n '($a.unapproved | (.. | arrays) |= sort) as $a | ($b.unapproved | (.. | arrays) |= sort) as $b | $a == $b' || diff -b -u ./qa/expect/$REPORT ./$REPORT\ntrue\n```\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/6da06eb096fdb812853951ec34ae1ef8fa81ec2e/includes-dev/qa-container_scanning.yml#L9\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/merge_requests/18","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-01T22:16:37.354Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T15:57:06.932Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T19:19:12.606Z","closed_by":{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::2","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"}],"author":{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13218","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13218","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13218/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13218/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#13218","relative":"#13218","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#13218"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23413964,"iid":13217,"project_id":278964,"title":"Design view: Zooming functionality","description":"### Job story\n\n[When] viewing a design, [I want to] zoom closer, [so I can] see the smaller details better.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nWhen viewing Designs it's possible to use the browser based zoom to change zoom level of the content.

While investigating https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10448#note_197871139, I found that the ajax crawler does not crawl the target URL specified in `$DAST_WEBSITE` / `-t`. Instead, it starts crawling from the root of the target website. For example, if the target website is `http://webgoat.local/WebGoat/attack`, it will start crawling from `http://webgoat.local/`.\n\nThis is problematic if the target website has no page at `/`. The crawler will just get a `404` for `/` and does not crawl any other pages.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Start a target application that does not have a page at `/`. For example, WebGoat.\n1. Check out the DAST repo, cd into it and build the image with `docker build --pull -t dast .`\n1. Start DAST with param `-j` so that it uses the AJAX crawler and with the log4j debug config, e.g. `docker run -v $(pwd)/config/zap-log4j.properties:/root/.ZAP_D/log4j.properties dast /analyze -t http://goat:8080/WebGoat/attack -j`.\n1. When inspecting the HTTP requests sent by the AJAX crawler, I found that it never requests the target URL `http://goat:8080/WebGoat/attack`, but instead `http://goat:8080` (the path portion of the target URL is discarded). The relevant HTTP log showing that `http://goat:8080` is requested instead of the target URL is:\n```\n2019-07-30 15:02:36,492 [ZAP-ProxyThread-20] DEBUG header - \u003e\u003e \"GET / HTTP/1.1[\\r][\\n]\"\n2019-07-30 15:02:36,492 [ZAP-ProxyThread-20] DEBUG HttpMethodBase - Adding Host request header\n2019-07-30 15:02:36,492 [ZAP-ProxyThread-20] DEBUG header - \u003e\u003e \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11;

We need to consume alerts from other sources. Since there are many monitoring tools that we could choose to integrate with, it would make more sense to create an endpoint/receiver/portal that customers can point their tools at a general portal that accepts alert payload.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n\n- Delaney, Development Team Lead, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead\n\n- Sasha, Software Developer, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer\n\n- Devon, DevOps Engineer, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer\n- Sidney, Systems Administrator, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator\n\n- Sam, Security Analyst, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst\n\n### Further Details\n\nThis supports the [Incident Management vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/debugging_and_health/incident_management/).\n\n### Original Proposal\nCreate a REST endpoint that accepts payloads and creates an issue with the payload in the body of the issue. Designate  fields that users can send in with the payload that map to the title of the issue and the summary. The summary is the section at the top of all issues that are created automatically from alerts. The summary includes:\n\n* `title` - This will be the title of the issue\n* `starts_at` - time the incident was triggered  \n* `description` - high-level summary of the problem\n* `service` - affected service \n* `runbook` - associated run book\n\nAll of these fields will be optional from the user's perspective. If the user does not include the `title` field in the payload of the incoming alert, **we need to figure out what the default title will be.**\nIf the user include any of the other fields (`starts_at`, `description`, `service`, `runbook`) in the payload of the incoming alert, we will exclude the field from the summary. \n\nFor the MVC, we will hard-code these fields and expect customers to configure alerts with values for these. Future iterations may include the ability for customers to choose what these fields are.\n\nQuestions:\n* What format do the payloads need to be? \n\n### Working MVC proposal\n\n* Receive alerts in the form of .json payloads to an alert endpoint (`\u003cproject-path\u003e/alerts/notify.json`) as `POST` http method\n* GitLab will look for a field called `title` in the incoming .json. If it is not present, we will set the title of the issue to be `New: Incident` before creation and immediately following creation we will change it too `New: Incident 123` - this will results in a system message posting to the incident timeline. \n* GitLab will also look for the following fields in the payload and paste them in the **Summary** section in the description of the issue in the order they are found in the payload. In any of the fields are not present, they will be excluded:\n  * start_time\n  * description\n  * monitoring_tool\n  * service\n  * hosts\n* The entire payload will be posted in the issue discussion [as a comment](https://sketch.cloud/s/zbJlo/a/79jn5E) authored by the GitLab Alert Bot\n* Configuration for this endpoint will live under Settings \u003e Integrations \u003e Alert Endpoint (this will be a new option in the integrations list). \n\n### Designs\n\nDesigns showing how the payload would look if sent to the issue comments can be seen in [Sketch Cloud](https://sketch.cloud/s/zbJlo).\n\nAuthentication will take place in Settings \u003e Integrations, where it will live within the [project services](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13203/designs/alert_endpoint_1.png) list. The copy for the 'Alert Endpoint' list item can be see [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13203/designs/Screen%20Shot%202019-08-22%20at%204.01.57%20PM.png).

pages","description":"**[HackerOne report #662287](https://hackerone.com/reports/662287)** by `vakzz` on 2019-07-28:\n\n### Related issues\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33798\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33459\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/engineering/issues/656\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen creating an RDoc wiki page it's possible to use a large number of html tags and attributes that are normally sanitized, when creating a linkable image of the format `{\u003cimg src\u003e}[link]`\n\nFor example it is possible to specify a `class` attribute when creating an image link:\n\n```rdoc  \n{\n\u003ca href='https://google.com' class='atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select'\u003e  \n\u003cimg height=10000 width=10000\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \n}[a]  \n```\n\nwill generate the following:\n\n```html  \n\u003cdiv class=\"md md-file\"\u003e  \n  \u003cp\u003eFull Page link\u003c/p\u003e  \n  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"a\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://google.com\" class=\"atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"10000\" width=\"10000\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n```\n\nThis will place a link taking over the entire page and intercept any clicks, `atwho-view select2-drop-mask pika-select` are just some real classes that make the links position absolute with a high z-index.\n\nThe `target` attribute could also be set to `_blank` and as there is no `rel=\"noopener\"` [reverse tabnabbing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Reverse_Tabnabbing) is also possible.\n\n\nAnother attack that is more likely to work would be to create a form in a modal, which could be used to ask for a username and password:\n\n```rdoc  \na form  \n{\n\u003cdiv class=\"modal show d-block\"\u003e  \n\u003cdiv class=\"modal-dialog\"\u003e  \n\u003cdiv class=\"modal-content\"\u003e  \n\u003cdiv class=\"modal-header\"\u003e  \n\u003ch3 class=\"page-title\"\u003ePlease Log In\u003c/h3\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cdiv class=\"modal-body\"\u003e  \n\u003cform class=\"new-wiki-page\" action=\"http://aw.rs/\"\u003e  \n\u003cdiv class=\"form-group\"\u003e  \n\u003clabel for=\"username\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eUsername\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/label\u003e  \n\u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"username\" id=\"username\" class=\"form-control\"\u003e  \n\u003clabel for=\"password\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePassword\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/label\u003e  \n\u003cinput type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" class=\"form-control\"\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cdiv class=\"form-actions\"\u003e\u003cbutton name=\"button\" type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\"\u003eLogin\u003c/button\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003c/form\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n}[/]  \n```\n\nWhich produces the following dialog when viewing the page:  \n![form.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/be16265a-ba37-4895-8169-2a96c0e79151/form.png)\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a wiki on gitlab  \n1. Add a new RDoc page with the above snippet  \n1. Save and wait for someone to click it\n\n\n### Impact  \nAn attacker could trick a user into thinking they had clicked on a gitlab element when they are actually redirected to the attackers site, or be presented with a dialog that will post to an attackers site.\n\n### Examples\n\nExample linking to a fake sign in form:  \nhttps://gitlab.com/wbowling/wiki/wikis/home\n\nExample creating a modal form:  \nhttps://gitlab.com/wbowling/wiki/wikis/home2\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nWhen using an image link in RDoc the anchor tag attributes are not sanitized correctly.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nThey should be correctly sanitized.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab

We've found that, while the API performs fine when making single requests, that it's performance will degrade notably under load testing.\n\nFor reference, the test conditions we have when testing this API is attempting to list the branches of the gitlab-ce project (~2150) under the expected throughput that the environment should be able to handle.  In this case we test against our reference 10k user environment that's expected to handle a throughput of 200 requests per second (RPS).\n\nWhen testing the API at a low 2 RPS we get a response time of **780.85ms**:\n```\nEnvironment:\t10k\nScenario:\t20s_2rps\nVersion:\t12.0.2-ee ef76b54fc1e\nNAME                                | RESULT | DURATION | P95      | RPS_COUNT | RPS_MEAN\n------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------\napi_v4_projects_repository_branches | Passed | 20.0s    | 780.85ms | 37        | 1.849993/s\n```\n\nWhen increasing this to 200 RPS though the response time increases exponentially and varies wildly in it's results.  In one test run we witnessed **5817.13ms**, around a 640% increase:\n```\nNAME                                                 | RESULT | DURATION | P95        | RPS_COUNT | RPS_MEAN    \n-----------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------\napi_v4_projects_repository_branches                  | Passed | 30.0s    | 5817.13ms  | 878       | 29.266581/s \n```\n\nExamining the logs and metrics for the environment it appears the endpoint at scale causes significant resource spikes (CPU, Memory).  We also noticed high amounts of GC:\n\n![Screenshot_2019-07-30_at_11.43.11](/uploads/ce03861ab3c9937ef4164b0e94f4684b/Screenshot_2019-07-30_at_11.43.11.png)\n**A snapshot of the above board can be found here - https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/xAYmbpGqDXd4gRM4xe5POogMgjKS9401**\n\nAdditionally we noticed two other points of information that may be useful:\n* When running the test at 200 RPS the API threw numerous 504 error codes (200: 2808, 504: 1868)\n* Prometheus monitoring dropped out for the `gitlab-rails` jobs when the API was being load tested, suggesting the webservers became unresponsive during the load test.\n\nBased on what's been gathered above it's presumed that this API isn't performant / efficient as other API's are and it should be investigated.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. If wanting to test against your own environment, import the gitlabhq project from GitHub or [via this tarball](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GoQZETqQ4Ns8iBS7TD-9Zj19r-JS-DoQ/view?usp=sharing) into a latest GitLab environment.  \n1. Once import has completed you should be able to start seeing the issue by loading the API, e.g. `http://10k.testbed.gitlab.net/api/v4/projects/qa-perf-testing%2Fgitlabhq/repository/branches`\n1. To run a load test against a local environment you'll need to use the [performance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance) project as follows:\n    1. Check out the [performance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance) project and read through it's README for reference\n    1. Edit the test scenario, `artillery/scenarios/quarantined/api_v4_projects_repository_branches.yml`, to run at the desired RPS by increasing the value `20` found against `rampUp` and `arrivalRate` to the value required.  E.G. For a RPS of 40 the file should look like:\n        \u003cp\u003e\n        \u003cdetails\u003e\n        \u003csummary\u003e\u003ccode\u003eartillery/scenarios/quarantined/api_v4_projects_repository_branches.yml\u003c/code\u003e example\u003c/summary\u003e\n        \n        ```\n        config:\n          defaults:\n            headers:\n              PRIVATE-TOKEN: \"{{ $processEnvironment.ACCESS_TOKEN }}\"\n              Accept: \"application/json\"\n\n          ensure:\n            maxErrorRate: 1\n\n          plugins:\n            expect: {}\n\n          phases:\n            - duration: 2\n              arrivalRate: 2\n              rampTo: 20\n              name: \"Warm up\"\n\n            - duration: 10\n              arrivalRate: 20\n              name: \"Load\"\n\n        scenarios:\n          - flow:\n              - get:\n                  url: /api/v4/projects/{{PROJECT_GROUP}}%2F{{PROJECT_NAME}}/repository/branches\n                  expect:\n                    - statusCode: 200\n        ```\n        \n        \u003c/details\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        * If you're wanting to test against the 10k environment this has slightly different config.  You'll need to increase the values to hit 200 RPS (we have it set at 20 by default as runner dockers can't handle this throughput and need to be run at scale, on a local machine this hasn't been found to be an issue). For example:\n            \u003cp\u003e\n            \u003cdetails\u003e\n            \u003csummary\u003e\u003ccode\u003eartillery/environments/10k.testbed.gitlab.net.yml\u003c/code\u003e example\u003c/summary\u003e\n        \n            ```\n            config:\n              target: http://10k.testbed.gitlab.net\n\n            variables:\n              PROJECT_GROUP: qa-perf-testing\n              PROJECT_NAME: gitlabhq\n              PROJECT_COMMIT_SHA: 0a99e022\n              PROJECT_BRANCH: 10-0-stable\n              PROJECT_FILE_PATH: qa%2Fqa%2Erb\n              PROJECT_MR_COMMITS_IID: 10495\n              PROJECT_MR_NOTES_IID: 6946\n              PROJECT_SIGNED_COMMIT_SHA: 6526e91f\n\n            phases:\n              - duration: 5\n                arrivalRate: 1\n                rampTo: 20\n                name: \"Warm up\"\n\n              - duration: 15\n                arrivalRate: 20\n                rampTo: 200\n                name: \"Ramp Up\"\n\n              - duration: 45\n                arrivalRate: 200\n                name: \"Full Load\"\n            ```\n        \n            \u003c/details\u003e\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n\n1. Notice that the tested environment's performance degrades notably once this endpoint is tested under load\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPerformance of environment degrades notably when the Branches API is tested at load.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nBranches API doesn't degrade performance of environment notably when used at approved loads.\n\n## Feature Flag Information\n\nThe first iteration of caching to improve this endpoint can be enabled using the following feature flag:\n\n```\n:merged_branch_names_redis_caching\n```\n\nThis will enable caching of `#merged_branch_names` on the `Repository` model.

Our main project is (say) `blah`, and we have hundreds of projects that have `blah` prefix or suffix (e.g. `blah-maker`). The search finds them instead of the exact match.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nImagine `gitlab-ce` is named `gitlab`. \n\n1. https://gitlab.com/-/operations (or equivalent)\n2. Add projects\n3. Type in something popular, e.g. `gitlab`.\n4. Good luck finding `gitlab`, if you have a repo under that name.

In some releases [License finder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) has changed the pretty names of the [licenses](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/lib/license_finder/license/definitions.rb). A license that's been approved or blacklisted may not be recognized.\r\n \r\nBetween [v5.6.2 and v5.9.2](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/compare/v5.6.2...v5.9.2#diff-ec177d4a88942f4297ebdf6e020b9e44) some license's [pretty names](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/lib/license_finder/license/definitions.rb) changed.\r\nIf user blacklisted some licenses and pretty name of that license has changed,\r\nthis will result in the license not being blacklisted anymore.\r\n\r\nSome highlighted changes  between *v5.6.2 and v5.9.2*\r\n- https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/commit/15b524fa52f63e04a82d160a7fc3d49c288d01e8\r\n- https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/commit/15b524fa52f63e04a82d160a7fc3d49c288d01e8#diff-ec177d4a88942f4297ebdf6e020b9e44\r\n- https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/commit/f1da96d4a72912787e5aeaadf96f69fde738f353#diff-ec177d4a88942f4297ebdf6e020b9e44\r\n\r\n### What is the current *bug* behaviour?\r\n\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven-multimodules/-/jobs/259711503\r\n\r\nWe can observe that our test project's QA failed due to change in license name. Difference can be seen in the MR: \r\n\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven-multimodules/merge_requests/15/diffs\r\n\r\nIf we blacklisted  as `LGPL 2.1` we wouldn't be able to catch it since it has changed to `GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example Project\r\n\r\nOur [java test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven-multimodules) \r\n\r\n### What is the expected *correct* behaviour?\r\n\r\nChanges in license names should be backwards compatible with our customer's [blacklist/whitelist items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/license_management/#project-policies-for-license-management) for license manager. \r\n\r\n### Possible fixes\r\n\r\n- Use customised report format for generating license report which considers `short_name` instead of `pretty_name`.(https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/lib/license_finder/license/definitions.rb). Short names doesn't seem to be changing version to version maybe we can leverage that to compare with blacklisted/whitelisted items. \r\n\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-26T15:31:22.840Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T14:15:35.967Z","closed_at":"2019-11-01T22:22:36.753Z","closed_by":{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:12.4","type::feature","workflow::canary"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"}],"author":{"id":3696420,"username":"caneldem","name":"Can Eldem","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3696420/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caneldem"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13083","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":13,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13083","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13083/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/13083/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#13083","relative":"#13083","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#13083"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23202723,"iid":13082,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Update feature flag UI to support percentage rollout\"","description":"The following discussion from !14538 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @pslaughter started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14538#note_195945895):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **issue:** This sounds like a pre-existing issue (so it shouldn't block this MR), but when I move too fast entering flags (not clicking the \"Create\" button that pops up) my input gets jumped to the bottom :shrug:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ![20190725_moving_too_fast_in_feature_flags](/uploads/c8ef3b02c38e3bfa354020a8161ecfb9/20190725_moving_too_fast_in_feature_flags.mp4)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-26T15:20:31.503Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T14:14:49.483Z","closed_at":"2020-06-24T14:14:49.442Z","closed_by":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"labels":["Category:Feature Flags","Enterprise Edition","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::release","frontend","group::release","internal customer","priority::4","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

See [Supported languages and package managers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers).\n\nMaven projects are scanned by the [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) analyzer, which relies on the [Gemnasium Maven Plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven-plugin) to build the list of the project dependencies. This can't work with Gradle projects because the dependencies are declared in a Gradle configuration file, not in a [POM XML](https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/blob/master/pom.xml) file.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- port the [Gemnasium Maven Plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven-plugin)\n  - build a dependency list for given Gradle project\n  - turn that list into a JSON document; see `Plugin output`\n- update [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven)\n  - change project detection and respond to Gradle file\n  - integrate the new Gemnasium Gradle plugin\n  - switch between the two plugins depending on the detected files\n\nThis would be similar to [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) which can handle multiple package managers.\n\nIt makes sense to reuse the existing [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) because Gemnasium will detect Maven packages hosted on Maven Central.\n\nUpdate [dependency-scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependency-scanning) (update Go module `gemnasium-maven`) and release a new version. This is needed so that legacy Docker-in-Docker based Dependency Scanning detects Gradle projects.\n\n### Plugin output\n\nThe Gemnasium Gradle plugin generates a JSON array of dependency objects.\n\nA dependency MUST have these fields:\n- `groupId` (string)\n- `artifactId` (string)\n- `version` (string)\n\nSee [current implementation of the parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/v2.2.6/scanner/parser/mvnplugin/mvnplugin.go).\n\nThe array SHOULD NOT contain duplicates, though this is something we can remediate in the [parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/v2.2.6/scanner/parser/mvnplugin/mvnplugin.go) if needed.\n\nA dependency MAY have these extra fields:\n\n- `classifier` (string)\n- `scope` (string)\n- `transitive` (boolean)\n- `parents` (array of `groupId:artifactId` strings)\n- `optional` (boolean)\n- `requirement` (string)\n\nSee [document generated by the Gemnasium Maven plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/v2.2.4/scanner/parser/mvnplugin/fixtures/big/maven-dependencies.json):\n\nTODO: establish which fields don't apply to Gradle dependencies, if any.\n\n### Documentation\n\nTo be documented in [Supported languages and package managers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers)\n\n### Testing\n\nTo be tested with a specific Gradle test project, to be added to [security-products/tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests)\n\nAt least two test projects are needed:\n- Gradle 4.0 or later\n- Gradle 3.x or earlier\n\nIf https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10658 is completed, update the CI configuration of `gemnasium-maven` (possibly renamed to `gemnasium-java`) to test it against:\n- Gradle projects (2 versions)\n- Maven projects (single POM and multi-module)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] define an output format for the Gemnasium Gradle Plugin\n- [x] port the [Gemnasium Maven Plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven-plugin) to Gradle\n- [x] update `java-gradle` [test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle) and add vulnerable dependencies as well as qa expectation file\n- [x] integrate Gemnasium Gradle Plugin into [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven), integrate test projects for QA, release a new version; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/merge_requests/17\n- [x] update dependency-scanning project\n- [x] update documentation to add new dependency capability\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDependency Scanning CI jobs succeeds instead of failing with the `No compatible analyzer can be found` error.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?

We discovered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13068 that we can use another tool called [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar) to streamline the container scanning process and avoid using docker-in-docker.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\n1. [x] Create a custom `build` image which runs the [clair server](https://github.com/coreos/clair) as a background process (perhaps using [supervisord](http://supervisord.org)) and does the following:\r\n    1. [x] Contains the [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar/releases/) binary and runs it against the image to be scanned\r\n    1. [x] Allows a whitelist to be provided and uses the same format and behaviour as the current container scanning tool\r\n    1. [x] Transforms the `JSON` report produced by `klar` into a format which can be parsed and displayed in the `Security` tab of the pipeline screen\r\n1. [x] Update the [Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/07ce26432538b03fea73f10d4df7f19fe792263e/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) template to use the custom `build` image from the above step as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11003 (completed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/16342)\r\n1. [x] Update [Container Scanning documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/index.html) including an explanation that the whitelist format has changed to the [following](https://github.com/arminc/clair-scanner/blob/v12/example-whitelist.yaml) (completed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/16404)\r\n\r\n### Permissions and Security\r\n\r\nNo change.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe introduction of [Container Scanning documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/index.html) needs to be updated because it explicitly mentions `clair-scanner`.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you are using GitLab CI/CD, you can check your Docker images (or more precisely the containers) for known vulnerabilities by using Clair and clair-scanner, two open source tools for Vulnerability Static Analysis for containers.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose?

New project from Template has different permissions","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen a User has the Developer role at the Group level and creates a new Project within the Group, their role on that Project depends on how it is created:\n\n- If they create a blank Project, they get Developer access\n- If they create a Project from an Instance-level Project Template, they get Maintainer access\n- It's not clear whether they can create a Project from a Group-level Template or not (See [EE 12806](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12806))\n\nNote I've only seen this on GitLab.com and I assume it's the same on self-managed instances. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a Group\n2. Add a Member to the Group with Developer access\n3. Sign out and then sign in as that Member\n4. Create a Project in the Group using the \"Blank project\" tab\n5. Create a Project in the Group using the \"Create from template\" tab\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe User who created the Project has Developer access to the Project created from the \"Blank project\" tab but Maintainer access to the Project created using the \"Create from template\" tab.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe User should have Developer access to both Projects. Or, if that's wrong, then they should have Maintainer access to both Projects - but at least it should be consistent.\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n\n/cc @jeremy
