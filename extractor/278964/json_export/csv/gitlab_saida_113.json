This is a very risky state of affairs. If application bugs cause group deletions to happen unexpectedly (e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40353), then the current deletion procedure creates a disaster for that customer, e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/11148. One such incident is currently causing the gitlab.com infrastructure team a lot of pain.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose that deleting a group flip a \"deleted\" flag in the DB. Resources flagged in this way appear deleted to the customer. Support / admins can flip that flag back for some time period, if the deletion was accidental. A regular cleanup job deletes metadata and associated git data of deleted groups older than some age.\n\nSome tiers have a configurable waiting period (see `ApplicationSettings#deletion_adjourned_period` and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223013#note_392443712), but that's not what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is blocked by the implementation of [delayed deletion of projects by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255449).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-25T11:16:55.421Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T09:56:27.423Z","closed_at":"2021-08-24T07:48:53.885Z","closed_by":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","infradev","internal customer","priority::1","section::dev","severity::2"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3911656,"username":"craigf","name":"Craig Furman","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3911656/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":55,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241146","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241146","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241146/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/241146/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#241146","relative":"#241146","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#241146"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70262563,"iid":241144,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add filter for non internal users in Users REST API","description":"The reason for this issue started in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/30738#note_401455806 and https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/169672.\n\nAt the moment, there is no way to return non-internal users in the Users' REST API.

Just change the value of `user_list_id` parameter in above request to any 2 digit sequential ID and send the request.\n\nYou should see the Name of the user list in the response as well as on the feature flag page when you reload. Note that this is also possible when feature flags you obtain belongs to private projects.\n\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPossible to get Feature Flag user list name of any

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nKeeping the latest artifact from the most recent successful job is a useful default behavior but can also result in significant amounts of storage usage. This can cause an unexpected surge in disk space usage if you have pipelines that generate large artifacts. To improve storage consumption management, you can now disable this behavior for any project in the settings. \n        \nComing up next, [gitlab#276583](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276583) will allow you to entirely disable keeping the latest artifacts at the instance level. \n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nCurrently the latest artifacts from a successful job/pipeline is always kept (implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16267) which is causing unwanted consumption of storage because there is no way to disable this at a project level or disable this for tags.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis issue addresses comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16267#note_401284828.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n### Proposal\n\nProvide users with an option to opt out of keeping the artifacts from last job, at project level.\n\n![Screenshot_2020-10-19_at_1.18.14_PM](/uploads/fc5c98760686e52faefa09553a4331de/Screenshot_2020-10-19_at_1.18.14_PM.png)\n\nThe settings for storing the latest artifacts from the last job would be enabled by defaults. If needed, users could opt out of this by unchecking the  `Keep latest artifacts from last successful jobs`  option under the Artifacts section on the projectlevel settings page.\n\nWhen viewing an artifact for a project where `Keep latest artifacts from last successful jobs` option is unchecked/disabled, update the **copy** in the sidebar to communicate that these latest artifacts will be deleted unless option to keep latest artifact regardless of expiration is enabled in project Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e Artifacts.`\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes - Yes, please add unit tests for new implemented logic accordingly.\n* End-to-end test change - There are 2 scenarios to be covered in E2E test, when this option is selected (by default) and when it is not. IMHO, The first scenario is already covered in this test [locked_artifacts_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/qa/qa/specs/features/ee/browser_ui/4_verify/locked_artifacts_spec.rb). The second scenario will need to be worked on while implementing this feature. Here is the proposal https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/1104\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

For example: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases\n\n### Alternatives\n\nIf we don't like the proposal above, there are some alternative we could consider:\n\n1. Infinite scroll. When the user reaches the bottom of the list, we automatically load the next 20 releases.\n1. A \"load more\" button. Same as above, except the additional items aren't automatically loaded.\n\n### Documentation\n\nI don't believe we need to make any documentation updates as a result of this change.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-24T20:11:33.929Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:48:47.141Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T13:38:20.341Z","closed_by":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","GraphQL","Release::P2","UX","cicd::active","devops::release","feature::enhancement","frontend","frontend-weight::1","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production`\n- [x] Cross post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [x] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature

Pick an issue and assign yourself if you currently are not assigned.\n1. Preparation:\n   1. Figure out on which pages your CSS is used, note down the HAML files. Note: Sometimes page specific CSS can be used on multiple pages!\n   1. Move the file from `app/assets/stylesheets/pages` to `app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`\n   1. Remove it from `page_specific_files.scss`\n   1. Add the file to `config/application.rb`\n   1. Add `- add_page_specific_style 'page_bundles/example'` to all haml templates you have identified that are using these styles. (available once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43680 lands, in order to drive bias for action you can use `= stylesheet_link_tag 'page_bundles/example'`) for now.\n1. Use CSS variables for all the colors. This is **crucial** for dark mode.\n   1. If a color doesn't have an exact match with [Pajamas colors](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/colors), choose the nearest color from the Pajamas colors. If there isn't an exact match, see whether a dark mode variable is available: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/themes/_dark.scss\n   1. If you have dark-mode related questions, consider pinging `@psimyn`.\n1. Ensure that the changed pages work properly\n1. Merge away!\n\n#### Notes\n\nIn order to quickly get our application.css size down, hold off on any unneeded optimizations, however while you are looking at the page specific styles, you can choose to optimize the following things *or* preferably create follow-up issues:\n\n1. Replacing certain properties with utility classes\n1. Sometimes a page specific CSS might contain classes of *distinct* pages. Then we could split those. (e.g. pipelines css for lists vs pipelines css for details pages)\n1. Removing unused CSS\n\n#### EE specific styles\n\nee/ follows the same pattern described, simply place the file into `ee/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`. It is even possible to extend CE styles, see: [cycle_analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/84864ec304dca5ca85052cf8b41185286b48f5bc/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles/cycle_analytics.scss) and it's [ee version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/84864ec304dca5ca85052cf8b41185286b48f5bc/ee/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles/cycle_analytics.scss).

likely to be used more frequently than other projects, so should appear before anything is typed. \nThis functionality is similar to what appears in the Groups/Projects dropdowns in the top navbar. \n\n### Proposal\n\n- Add frequently/recently visited Projects and Groups to the Project and Group dropdown filters on the search result page.\n- Show up to **`5`** recent/frequent Groups/Projects\n\n### Release Notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the customer symptom we are improving?

It prevents other developers from hijacking schedules, but allows master to fully control them. Master already has access to Secret Variables.\n\nBut api endpoints are cleary showing this values to everyone even if the user is not part of the project. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/pipeline_schedules.html#get-a-single-pipeline-schedule\n\n\n#####  PoC\n\nThis is my test project https://gitlab.com/thevicc/trigg with schedule pipeline which custom variables you can\u0026#39;t read.\n\nNow, run this to read the variable and its value\n\n`curl  --header \u0026#34;Private-Token: \u0026lt;your_access_token\u0026gt;\u0026#34;  https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/20618145/pipeline_schedules/69918`\n\nResponse  \n![poc_var.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/3388a38e-bc38-42e8-81c3-7fa1af55a321/poc_var.png)\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n* Create a project and add a schedule pipeline with custom variables  \n*  Only you or owner can read variables  \n* As second account, use the api `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/pipeline_schedules.html#get-a-single-pipeline-schedule`\n\n####  Impact\n\nThis bug allows unauthorized users to read scheduled pipeline custom variables and values.

MR approval settings are blocking editing project approval rules","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen enabled, the new MR approval settings prevent users editing approval rules on the project-level when the project has an associated compliance framework label. The current ~\"UI text\" does not adequately communicate the intended behavior.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to `[GDK_URL/GITLAB_URL]/admin/push_rule#merge-request-approval-settings`\n2. Select at least one compliance framework label and optionally select checkboxes\n3. Go to a project of your choice and go to the general settings\n4. Select one of the compliance framework labels which matches one you ticked in the instance settings\n5. Open the merge request approval settings and see you do not get an `Add approval rule` button or any way to edit existing rules\n\n### What is the current experience?\n\nProject-level approval rules are blocked from being edited even if `Prevent users from modifying merge request approvers list` is unticked.\n\n### Proposal\n\nClarify the ~\"UI text\" to communicate the behavior from enabling these instance-level settings.\n\n### Further detail\n\nThere are other proposals that are WIP that will affect this non-intuitive behavior. We should consider:\n\n1. Implementing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1111 to add group-level MR approval rules\n1. Validate whether we need to bring MR approvals to the instance-level or not\n1. Consider removing the instance-level controls depending on the validation outcome of `2`\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n|Video|Screenshot of locked Approval Rules|\n|---|---|\n|![Blocking_approval_rules](/uploads/f528fc9bbc8b12916a37b57b029ed1f7/Blocking_approval_rules.mp4)|![image](/uploads/497cf1510d8c2d5861ca31ede08dc341/image.png)|\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe problem occurs because the `project_helper` is checking `can_modify_approvers` for the editing ability: `ee/app/helpers/ee/projects_helper.rb:99`. This checks the `:modify_approvers_rules` policy for the current user against the project.\n\nThis policy is blocked by `cannot_modify_approvers_rules` (`ee/app/policies/ee/project_policy.rb:358`), which in turn is controlled by `has_regulated_settings?` (`ee/app/models/ee/project.rb:221`). This checks to see if the compliance framework label set on the instance level matches the projects compliance framework. If it does, then it locks down the approval rules.\n\nTo fix this we need to change the policy so this locking only occurs for MR-level approval rules by tweaking the policy or creating a new check for the frontend to use.\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-21T15:16:45.231Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T16:12:05.181Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T04:10:38.812Z","closed_by":{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::compliance","priority::2","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"}],"author":{"id":5209897,"username":"rob.hunt","name":"Robert Hunt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5209897/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rob.hunt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/239349","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239349","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239349/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239349/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#239349","relative":"#239349","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#239349"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3432,"epic":{"id":59818,"iid":3432,"title":"Allow admins to scope admin-level MR approval settings to compliance-labeled projects","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3432","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70118323,"iid":239348,"project_id":278964,"title":"Insufficient Type Check leading to Developer ability to delete Project, Repository, Group, ...","description":"**[HackerOne report #960244](https://hackerone.com/reports/960244)** by `ledz1996` on 2020-08-17, assigned to @dcouture:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nSimilar bug to #858671, but this time with annotations mutation: `DeleteAnnotation`\n\nin ***app/graphql/mutations/metrics/dashboard/annotations/base.rb***\n\n```ruby  \nmodule Mutations  \n  module Metrics  \n    module Dashboard  \n      module Annotations  \n        class Base \u0026lt; BaseMutation  \n          private\n\n          # This method is defined here in order to be used by `authorized_find!` in the subclasses.  \n          def find_object(id:)  \n            GitlabSchema.object_from_id(id)  \n          end  \n        end  \n      end  \n    end  \n  end  \nend\n\n```\n\nThere is no type check for `find_object` in ***app/graphql/mutations/metrics/dashboard/annotations/delete.rb***  \n```ruby  \n    annotation = authorized_find!(id: id)\n\n            result = ::Metrics::Dashboard::Annotations::DeleteService.new(context[:current_user], annotation).execute  \n```\n\nAnd luckily, Developer is sufficient for the permission check \n\n***app/services/metrics/dashboard/annotations/delete_service.rb***  \n```ruby  \nAbility.allowed?(user, :delete_metrics_dashboard_annotation, annotation)  \n```\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Creates an empty repository for the Snippet ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/snippets/update_service.rb#L86))\n2. Creates a file (or files) for the given snippet action params ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/snippets/update_service.rb#L100))\n3. Updates the Snippet `content` and `file_name` attributes to be that of the first snippet action file ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/snippets/update_service.rb#L35))\n\nAlthough point 3 will be removed in the near future (see [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/snippets/update_service.rb#L35)), we still need to address the fact that no file is created for the snippet during point 1.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWhen creating the repository in the `Snippets::UpdateService` ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/snippets/update_service.rb#L86)) we should also create an initial file with the `file_name` and `content` from the Snippet.\n\nWe can possibly achieve this by modifying the params or snippet actions to include an entry for the original snippet content, but this runs the risk of file name conflicts with any existing actions that the user passes in, so we will probably want to check for that and generate a filename instead (as we've done in elsewhere for the migration to versioned snippets), e.g. `snippetfile1.txt`, if that's the case.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-21T12:00:01.294Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T07:07:26.937Z","closed_at":"2020-09-23T15:56:34.623Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/239327","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239327","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239327/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239327/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#239327","relative":"#239327","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#239327"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2829,"epic":{"id":28402,"iid":2829,"title":"Snippets with Multiple Files","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2829","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70107734,"iid":239326,"project_id":278964,"title":"Can't leave a comment or draft comment on moved files with no changes","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWe recently shipped the ability to expand the content of a moved file with no changes.\n\nHowever, leaving a comment or draft comment is failing.\n\n![renamed-file](/uploads/951859e736f905acd19a77f096f9b3fd/renamed-file.gif)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Usually people will use Gmail search or hope that Google chrome URL bar remembers it by typing a few keywords. These options all have their own challenges as they are not purpose built for this task.\n\n## Solution\n\nThere should be some way to search for issues or merge requests which is ordering results based on how recently you looked at the document.\n\nIdeally you would get some search box which has a bunch of auto completed issues/merge requests list below which is just an ordered list of the most recently viewed issues/merge requests and as you type we start filtering down that list.\n\nThis could just be incorporated as part of the existing auto complete features in our current search bar.\n\n## Technical notes\n\n### Frontend approach\n\nWe could actually save on storage here by doing this entirely in the frontend. Javascript could save the recently viewed issues/MRs in local storage and filter down that list. It would be very performant and cost GitLab nothing. It also may be preferable to users as it involves less tracking.\n\n### Backend approach\n\nWe currently don't store anywhere the last MRs a user has viewed. We'd need some data model for this. It could be quite expensive storage but we'd obviously want to limit this to a small number of issues/merge requests and expire it after a period of time (eg. 30 days).\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-20T23:52:09.309Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T17:19:24.520Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T17:01:30.512Z","closed_by":{"id":4888751,"username":"changzhengliu","name":"Changzheng Liu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4888751/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/changzhengliu"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","UX","devops::data_stores","direction","group::global search","section::enablement","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/239166","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239166","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239166/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/239166/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#239166","relative":"#239166","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#239166"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70085736,"iid":239133,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `generic_packages`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:generic_packages` feature flag.\n\nThis feature flag enables/disables the new Generic Packages repository.\n\nEpic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4209\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::release management\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_release-management`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @krasio \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe're rolling out new type of packages repository (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4209), enabling this feature flag will make the related API ednpoints available.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe new Generic Packages repository not working\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- [Grafana dashboard for Generic Packages API](url)\n- [Sentry search for \"ObjectStorage::RemoteStoreError\"](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+%22ObjectStorage%3A%3ARemoteStoreError%22)\n\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early.

Both of which are often used as identifiers between two different packages. For example, the below example would all be displayed in the UI as `Hello` version `1.0`.\n\n```sh\nHello/1.0@sabrams/stable\nHello/1.0@sabrams/beta\nHello/1.0@other_user/stable\n```\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-08-20_at_2.55.51_PM](/uploads/6acf07aea6d7bea42f721093657ed7ca/Screen_Shot_2020-08-20_at_2.55.51_PM.png)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### User experience goal\n- A user can easily distinguish between different versions of their Conan package.\n\n### Proposal\nDisplay the full recipe for Conan packages on the packages (`/-/packages`) list page. \n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_13.16.11](/uploads/d6e66ddfd3938571d594e7fc17ff768e/Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_13.16.11.png)\n\nThe Package detail should be updated in a similar way:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_13.18.58](/uploads/bb53746c62ed4b67cb69fead25285bfb/Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_13.18.58.png)\n\nThe \"Other versions\" tab will be updated to show when the versions are the same but the channels are different. For example, all three of the examples should be shown in the Other versions tab.\n\n```\nHello/1.0@sabrams/beta\nHello/1.0@sabrams/stable\nHello/2.0@sabrams/stable\n```\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Beyond this issue\nWe will want to think about how to display the different \"configurations\" as seen in the conan-center packages. An audit of expected package metadata is being done in issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/package-stage/package/-/issues/3#note_395751854\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_2.16.41_PM](/uploads/2f0ebbe906237d4791040afa334715fd/Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_2.16.41_PM.png)\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no  expected permissions changes for this issue\n\n### Documentation\n- There are no  expected documentation changes for this issue\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nThis issue is part of an on-going effort to drive adoption and usage of the Conan Repository.

The usage is ping is looking for job names like 'sast', 'dast'. Those job names are defined if a user uses the builtin template, but those names are customizable.

This is evidenced by this comment, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/merge_requests/3408#note_399599737\n\nThe usage ping should instead be keying off report key, as that is not a customizable value such as `dast` in the example below.\n\n```yaml\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dast: gl-dast-report.json\n```\n\nBecause reporting is based on job name, no fuzzing jobs will be reported since users must customize their job name.\n\n\n#### Implementation Plan\n\nNote: the following implementation plan has been altered to ensure that current metric definitions are not changed.\n\n- [ ] ~~The value of the metric `counts.[analyzer]_jobs` should be replaced by the value of the metric `usage_activity_by_stage.secure.[analyzer]_scans`.~~\n- [ ] ~~The value of the metrics `usage_activity_by_stage.secure.user_[analyzer]_jobs` should be converted to be based on the scan type~~\n- [ ] ~~The `user_unique_users_all_secure_scanners` metric value should be based on the scan type.~~\n- [x] API Fuzzing should be added as a scan type to the secure schemas.

email services `notify_only_broken_pipelines` was changed only for new projects [13.2 Regression]","description":"### Summary\n\n**[13.2 Regression]**\n\nThe pipeline-email services API delivers different responses for `notify_only_broken_pipelines` based on when the project was created.\n\nIt returns either **true** or **1**.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Look at an old project (\u003c 13.2) where pipeline emails are setup: `https://your-instance/api/v4/projects/\u003cid\u003e/services/pipelines-email`\n1. Look at a newly created project\n\n## Old\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": xxxxx,\n  \"title\": \"Pipelines emails\",\n  \"slug\": \"pipelines-email\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2017-12-01T07:31:23.264Z\",\n

\"2020-08-20T12:21:47.794Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2020-08-20T12:21:47.794Z\",\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"commit_events\": true,\n  \"push_events\": true,\n  \"issues_events\": true,\n

\"notify_only_broken_pipelines\": \"true\",\n    \"branches_to_be_notified\": \"default\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API depends differently, based on how old the project is and either returns `1` or `true`.\nWhile I think breaking API changes are fine, these should be consistent at least\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe `services/pipelines-email` API should **EITHER** return **1** or **true**, not depending on which project is requested.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-20T12:47:42.503Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T11:56:09.493Z","closed_at":"2021-06-25T10:20:23.382Z","closed_by":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo
