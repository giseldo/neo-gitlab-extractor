For this reason it's useful to start with this option disabled and allow selective use.\n\nAPI Fuzzing already has the ability to test HTTP headers, however it was disabled in 13.3 to provide a better default experience.

This is the message passed back to the Git client as part of the `Gitlab::GitAccess::ForbiddenError`. When the message is `nil`, the only error the client sees is the exception class itself. \n\nThere are dozens of places where GitLab raises `Gitlab::GitAccess::ForbiddenError`. @cody, @dstanley and I debugged this issue with a customer in a call. It was extremely difficult to find the root cause since the error message was nil/generic. \n\nWe ultimately tracked it down to a blocked push because the license was expired. The license had expired on January 18, 2020. They thought they had uploaded a new license but did not. \n\n- License is checked as part of [`check_change_access!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/cd36b8c8ca8f96eac4a44fa92b6cc746aed2f3cc/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/git_access.rb#L105-108).\n- The [`license_message`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/cd36b8c8ca8f96eac4a44fa92b6cc746aed2f3cc/ee/app/helpers/ee/subscribable_banner_helper.rb#L26) is generated from [`Gitlab::ExpiringSubscriptionMessage`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/cd36b8c8ca8f96eac4a44fa92b6cc746aed2f3cc/ee/lib/gitlab/expiring_subscription_message.rb). \n\nThe piece here that is confusing is how much logic goes into the very first line of the [`Gitlab::ExpiringSubscriptionMessage#message`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/cd36b8c8ca8f96eac4a44fa92b6cc746aed2f3cc/ee/lib/gitlab/expiring_subscription_message.rb#L20) method. No matter what the case, for an expired license, we should show some message when we block a push. \n\nMaybe the disconnect happens because this class is also used to decide whether we display a banner to users/admins in the UI. But we also didn't see a banner in the UI when signed in as an admin, either. So I think this is a bug affecting both pushes and the lack of banner in the UI when the license is expired.\n\n\n## Reported Examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/171723\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/197572\n1.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-10T19:15:20.771Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T20:57:33.584Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T20:57:17.154Z","closed_by":{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rubén Dávila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/280339/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdavila"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Provision","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","missed:14.1","priority::2","section::fulfillment","severity::3","type::bug","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rubén Dávila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/280339/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdavila"}],"author":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rubén Dávila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/280339/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdavila"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235392","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235392","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235392/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/235392/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#235392","relative":"#235392","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#235392"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69647296,"iid":235391,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support Group Milestones to be associated with Project Releases in API","description":"### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing?

Update `analyzers/common` to detect and parse `.gitlab/sast-rules.toml`\n1. If configuration file is present, analyzer provides a compatible customization hook ([similar to our `plugin.go` architecture](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec/-/blob/master/plugin/plugin.go)), and `[[ANALYZER.passthrough]]` is present, provide analyzer-specific configuration `file` to underlying tool (gosec-only initially)\n1. Check for `GITLAB_PLAN` [as defined in licensing issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235374) using [`os.GetEnv`](https://golang.org/src/os/env.go?s=2860:2890#L91)\n\n```toml\n[gosec]\n  description = 'gosec custom rules configuration'\n\n  [[passthrough]]\n    type = file\n    source/target/destination = gosec-config.json\n    value = gosec-config.json\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nThe initial usecase is to reach feature parity with the previously introduced [`SAST_GOSEC_CONFIG`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#analyzer-settings) functionality of the [`gosec` analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec). By instead providing a method of supplying the configuration through [our SAST rules configuration file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229579#links-references) instead of directly via an ENV.\n\nThis reframes our customization functionality around a single customization entrypoint and provides the basic framework within `common` and our analyzers to build on top of.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change to permissions\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Update [Static Application Security Testing docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html) with new section on configuration file\n- [optionally] Consider deprecating `SAST_GOSEC_CONFIG`\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n- Add unit tests to `analyzers/common` covering new customization architecture\n- Add downstream test to `analyzers/gosec` where configuration file is specified to modify default behavior (similar to [`gosec-config-FREEZE`

a link to Test Report documentation when no test reports are uploaded","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nIf I don't already export/upload test reports in a junit format as part of my pipeline I see an empty test report tab on the pipeline page.\n\n![Tests tab without tests](/uploads/b17f13caa38db3f1dc7b547510fc306e/Screen_Shot_2020-08-10_at_10.50.31_AM.png)\n\nAs a developer who has tests in their pipeline, I want to get started quickly with the Test summary and test report features, so that I can quickly diagnose test failures in the Gitlab UI.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who sees 0 reported on the test tab but knows tests are output from their pipeline.\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer) - who gets reports about this 0 showing up but isn't sure how to get the team's test reports into the gitlab UI.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe user should be able to get to the JUnit report documentation from an empty test tab with 1 click.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAdd a link to the JUnit report documentation to the message about 0 tests.\n\nSomething like \"There are no tests to show. Learn about how to upload test reports to see how tests are changing and the full report of tests run in a pipeline. [Read the JUnit Report Documentation.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html)\"\n\n### Technical proposal\n\n- Add the documentation link to [the empty state section of the test reports component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/93d77316b5d03f06fd6e38f7dceb577b2df9977b/app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/components/test_reports/test_reports.vue#L89). We'll have to conditionally show this link if there is no test report, but show the current message if we just have an empty report.\n- Add a data attribute for saying whether the pipeline has a test report [in the HAML file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/3ec5c3e11ab1716216aa1acfd80e465a38cb6cb8/app/views/projects/pipelines/_with_tabs.html.haml#L84)\n- We should probably also not fetch the test report summary if we already know the pipeline doesn't have a test report. We can do that [by not running `fetchSummary` in the test reports component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/93d77316b5d03f06fd6e38f7dceb577b2df9977b/app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/components/test_reports/test_reports.vue#L28).\n- We'll need to update [the test reports component spec file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/fa456fe2971aa0b66091c08c71cc9dbe571763ab/spec/frontend/pipelines/test_reports/test_reports_spec.js#L0-1) to test this scenario.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis is a simplified version of the messaging on the DAG pipeline that is being used to drive awareness of that feature.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n* If no reports are uploaded the messaging appears.\n* If an empty report is uploaded do what is done today.\n* If a report is uploaded with data to parse do what is done today.\n\n#### Success Measures\n* We will review page views of the JUnit docs page 90 days after release of this feature and expect a 10% increase in page views.\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nThis is for the Individual Developer who can setup their own pipeline OR can influence the decision to output test data in the JUnit format.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can find the correct ones!\n\nType - for example ~feature ~bug ~documentation ~meta /label ~\"feature::addition\" ~\"feature::maintenance\" ~tooling ~\"tooling::pipelines\" ~\"tooling::workflow\" per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#type-labels\n\nDevOps stage - for example ~\"devops::secure\" \n\nGroup - for example ~\"group::composition analysis\"\n\nCategory - for example ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\"\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones!

code, and the bug needs to be fixed in the upstream `wikicloth` gem (which we pull in through our `gitlab-markup` gem).\n\nIt only affects files with .wiki suffixes which are parsed as MediaWiki markup. However, I also can't reproduce the error.\n\nThis appears to be due to the way params are being handled in the WikiCloth gem. It is unclear if this has to do with functions, or if this is related to something else. In any case, sentry logs make it clear there are several pages we could ask users to view, if that is something we can do (I would be hesitant to bother users, but this may help resolve any issues they are having).\n\n## Potential MR Breakdown\n\n- bugfix in wikicloth\n- version bump in gitlab-markup\n- version bump in gitlab","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-10T16:53:26.544Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T03:03:10.966Z","closed_at":"2021-09-27T03:03:10.934Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","group::editor","priority::4","section::dev","severity::4","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

specified in the `Dockerfile` and the one reported by `scan.scanner.version`\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nA mismatched version will cause an error, or it simply isn't possible to have mismatched versions\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"Enterprise Edition\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes, this affects all secure

Display vulnerabilities by age in security dashboards","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nToday we show trend data about vulnerabilities by severity, which is great for helping users understand how their project(s) are performing historically. Next, to further enhance the dashboard experience, we should show users vulnerabilities by age. This will allow teams to identify vulnerabilities that may be slipping past their SLAs.  \n\n### Intended users\n\n* Security Directors\n* Security Managers\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n**When** I am managing vulnerabilities for my organization, **I want** to quickly identify remediations that are slipping, **so I can** take escalation action and avoid missing an SLA or worse, have my organization breached.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a [stacked column chart](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/charts-stacked-column-chart--with-zoom-and-scroll) that allows users to visualize the age-range of a vulnerability based on conventional time buckets. \n\n### Further details\n\nStart with adding this chart to the Project Security Dashboard, then the Instance, and finally Group.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can find the correct ones!\n\nType - for example ~feature ~bug ~documentation ~meta /label ~\"feature::addition\" ~\"feature::maintenance\" ~tooling ~\"tooling::pipelines\" ~\"tooling::workflow\" per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#type-labels\n\nDevOps stage - for example ~\"devops::secure\" \n\nGroup - for example ~\"group::composition analysis\"\n\nCategory - for example ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\"\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones! --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-07T19:00:34.479Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T14:09:53.647Z","closed_at":"2021-03-29T19:14:15.138Z","closed_by":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","GitLab Ultimate","UX","customer","devops::secure","group::threat insights","missed:13.10","section::sec","security dashboard","type::feature","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"}],"author":{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/234193","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/234193","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/234193/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/234193/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#234193","relative":"#234193","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#234193"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5354,"epic":{"id":198469,"iid":5354,"title":"Display vulnerabilities by age in security dashboards","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5354","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69552907,"iid":234120,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Spike skeleton of Repository Strategy for Snippets","description":"Lay a foundation for replicating Repositories so it's clear where code should be, so we can parallelize the rest of the Epic work.\n\nOn a call with @vsizov about https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38688, we settled on some rough big ideas:\n\n- We need a `ReplicatoryStrategy` and a `ModelStrategy` for Blobs.

In regulated environments, the addition or removal of users to a project or group must follow an approval process and be documented. Other organizations want to spread the load and allow more users to manage group and project membership.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWork on a POC to add project member management as an action that can be defined in a project Policy. During the POC, engineering will evaluate approaches to extend our current permission model to allow denying for specific actions. This model will ideally pave the way for fully custom roles in the future without introducing too much technical debt. We don't have to worry about UX for now but please consider the designs in  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280534 and leave feedback there if anything discovered is incompatible.\n\nRelevant background information:\n* [Research proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/62)\n* [Prototype allowing limited set of custom roles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5626)\n* [Project-level policy framework for deny epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4168)\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n**What risks does this change pose to our availability?**\n\nThis is low risk to GitLab.com availability. However, one risk I see is the member management feature being (unintentionally) disabled for users that currently have them such as the project owners and admins resulting lockout of this feature.\n\n**What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?***\n- If the deniable policy is assigned to a user, they should not be able to add/remove user to the project from the UI as well as the API\n- On GitLab.com, the deniable policy should not be applicable to owner users.\n- If the user that has the deniable policy applied in a project is also part of another project in the same parent group, the deniable policy should not affect the user's ability to perform that action in the other project.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-07T15:54:28.633Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T13:10:33.067Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T16:32:24.077Z","closed_by":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","FY22::Q1","GitLab Premium","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","customer","devops::manage","direction","group::authentication and authorization","missed:14.2","missed:14.3","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Search Background Migrations for Elasticsearch Indexing","description":"## Problem\n\nAt some point we will need to do a migration to our Elasticsearch index that is more than just reindexing within a cluster. For example when we want to add epics to the index https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/4745 or any other issue that may require us to start indexing something new about a document.\n\nFor now this issue will serve as a place to brainstorm ideas about this and link up to previous discussions and ideas.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Original plan for multi version support\n\nOriginally we planned to introduce multi version support using an approach that was fully reliant on GitLab to manage both indexes, reading from the old one and writing to both until the migration finished. Some more information at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18254 and https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1769 . As at writing this (%\"13.3\") most of the code still exists for this in GitLab in a half implemented form.\n\nThe 2 primary concerns I had with this approach were:\n\n1. Reindexing was done on the GitLab side and it involved reading every single document from the database and sending it to Elasticsearch again. At the rate we index things this will likely take weeks compared to our current in cluster reindexing which can finish in under 24 hrs and can arbitrarily be made faster by scaling up the cluster before the operation.\n2. Reindexing everything from GitLab to the cluster again may be very wasteful on occasions where you only need to change a small part of the index. For example if we want to add epics to the index it is very wasteful to reindex every document in the index when we could very quickly just index all the epics. There are many situations where we will be trying to perform some migration that can be done more efficiently using a targeted approach (eg. adding a new field to a document type only requires reindexing all the documents that actually have that field). The implementation we had was very generic and as such we couldn't write very custom migrations that did the least amount of work possible but instead we just relied on reindexing everything from scratch for any change.\n3. The actual implementation itself writes to both indexes at the same time which means one slow index will block indexing and if we are reindexing to a new cluster it may be under very high load which will slow down the incremental indexing as well since they are coupled. This could have probably been fixed by refactoring the code a little but it was another part that still needed to be improved.\n\n### Directory of migrations, migrations are workers\n\nI believe that we should do our best to take inspiration from rails DB migrations for whatever solutions we come up with. There are many things to be learnt from these that we don't want to have to learn again.\n\nAs such I can imagine a simple approach might be to have a directory of workers. Those workers are numbered like rails migrations and get executed in order. The completion of a worker is persisted in the Elasticsearch cluster. A periodic sidekiq worker is looking for new workers in this directory that haven't yet run. These worker names should start with a timestamp like DB migrations to ensure they are run in order.\n\nWe might be tempted to persist the migrations that have run in Postgres. This may not be perfect for the situation where a user wants to connect up a new ES cluster to GitLab. It's probably better to persist the migrations themselves in the ES cluster itself so it's more likely to be in sync.\n\nOne problem I can think of is that a job may not be appropriate for a very long migration. We would likely want to spawn many smaller sidekiq jobs from a migration. Perhaps we can use a \"Poison Pill\" approach in which we queue up a bunch of jobs that are to be executed in sequence (1 at a time) and then add one last job after all of those which is the job which signifies the migration is complete and is the one which then writes to the completed migrations index in Elasticsearch.\n\nSometimes a migration will need to involve actually triggering a reindex of the ES cluster. Since we may need to reindex the cluster before adding some new data. This could probably still make use of the existing reindex feature in GitLab. The sidekiq worker might just kick off the reindexing and keep requeueing itself until the reindex is completed and then it would persist the fact that the reindex is completed.\n\nA sidekiq migration may also be just triggering something that runs on the ES cluster and watching until it completes. For example an in-cluster reindex might make use of `script` to transform the data during the migration or filter out certain documents. Or it might perform an \"Update all\" operation that runs a script on a set of docs to update some part of them.\n\n### Release notes\n\nAdding features to Advanced Search would often require a manual reindex to be able to immediately use the new feature.\n\nNow when we add new features, reindexing will happen in the background without manual intervention.

In most cases, when users were attempting to add one issue to another as related or blocked, they would enter the ID number only (without the hashtag), which resulted in an error. They often did not read the placeholder text. In another case, they wanted to enter the title of the issue.\n\nThese challenges resulted sometimes in the user not being able to complete the scenario at all, or completing them after a time but giving the task a low score for ease of use and meeting requirements.\n\nThere are other design opportunities for Related items such as layout and flow that could be addressed in separate issues, but this issue focuses on the primary interaction problem which was surrounding the users frequently not entering the hashtag and how to simplify that process for them.\n\n### Proposals\n\n- We can currently search by issue number if you first input `#`. The basic idea would be for the FE to automatically append the `#` to any issue number...so If i type `#` followed by `12` we would autocomplete based on issue number. If I just start typing `12`, we append `#` to the beginning of the string being passed in to the search it will still autocomplete based by issue number without the user having to remember to first add `#`. \n\nOther ideas:\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n* Option 1: Improve smart search to detect issue number with or without # for related items. Considerations will need to be made regarding how this affects other related items such as related MRs to issues and issues/sub-epics to epics. In that case, showing results as groups, segmented by object type seems like a good first step. Longer term, having a [single customizable widget](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229731) may be the better approach.\n* Option 2: Attach a hashtag by default for linked issues as an uneditable piece (separate input I assume) if we're only going to allow one object association to another for the time being. This would automatically apply the element so the user doesn't have to type it in. Epics allows either associating epics to issues or other epics, but it's still a prescribed path currently. Eventually, could provide a dropdown for this so the user can select the character associated with the object type.

I proposed including \"Move issue\" here as well. Reference also may make sense here. But those elements I believe are more related to general issue management rather than attributes of an issue. \"Move issue\" could be a concept that may need to be bumped to a separate discussion, but combining these like elements could not only clean up the right sidebar, but make both features a bit more discoverable and reduce the user's cognitive load in having multiple ways to manage an issue. The \"To Do\" option could potentially also go here.\n* Option 2: Add \"Promote\" to sidebar. In this case, we'd keep \"Move issue\" in the bar, but add Promote.[ See examples](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233974/designs/Paper.Project.24.png).\n\n\n### MVCs\n\n- [ ] Move existing `Move`, `New issue`, and `Report abuse` into combined list drop down\n- [ ] Add `Promote to epic` to list drop down\n- [ ] Keep `Close issue` to the left of the ellipsis. Leave color as it is currently (we'll update it in another issue)\n- [ ] Figure out UX for adding Move to the drop down given the user will need to be able to specify the target project the issue is to be moved to.\n\n### Feature flag\n\nThe ellipsis dropdown menu, and `Promote to epic dropdown item`, is behind the feature flag `:vue_issue_header`. This flag applies to the frontend and is defaulted to off.\n\n### Release Notes\n\nDescription: Promoting an Issue to an Epic is not an intuitive process as you have to use a [Quick Action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html) when editing an Issue description or making a comment. To make this action more discoverable, we've introduced a new secondary actions menu in the Issue header and added a button to quickly promote an Issue to an Epic with a single click.

If the File Tree is rendering in Tree view mode, in some situations the order is not what is expected (because it's following the List mode).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Enable file by file mode in https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences\n1. Go to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31610/diffs\n1. Ensure you are in Tree View mode\n1. Scroll down to the file: `definition_spec.rb`\n1. Push \"next\", below the diff file\n1. See that you didn't jump to `use_rugged_spec.rb`, as would be expected.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31610/diffs\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIt always follows the list view order.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIt respects the order being shown on the file sidebar on the left.

 (+3 comments)\n\n    \u003e @beckalippert Would you review some pieces of the UX here, please? In particular:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e - I've updated the SAST Configuration UI's subheading text to comply with the [latest designs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228830), although I'm not 100% sure about the wording.\n    \u003e - I added an error state in the case the configuration data couldn't be loaded (this is a non-user-recoverable problem).

As you navigate to the \"changes\" tab of the merge request, simply click the gear icon and check the box labeled `Display one file at a time`. This will display a single file at a time and enable the `prev` and `next` buttons to navigate among files.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-06T10:19:14.305Z","updated_at":"2021-06-17T00:44:17.693Z","closed_at":"2020-12-08T18:51:00.698Z","closed_by":{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","design-weight::1","devops::create","feature::addition","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.5","missed:13.6","release post item","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233898","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233898","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233898/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233898/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#233898","relative":"#233898","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#233898"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":516,"epic":{"id":1789,"iid":516,"title":"📑 File-by-file merge request diff navigation MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/516","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69498565,"iid":233888,"project_id":278964,"title":"Tail or cat or add a message if compilation fails","description":"Sometimes we are piping outputs of commands into files.

Today, we have a performance issue that stopped environments **still retain [deployment refs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#check-out-deployments-locally)**. This cause [performance degradation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/56466#note_132597317). In fact, customers [also face this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19724#note_372832148). Another example =\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223155\n\nWe should **delete** unnecessary environments in order to speed up git operation. This brings a lot of benefits to entire GtiLab features, especially GitLab-Runners that the total amount of refs they need to fetch will be significantly reduced.\n\n## Proposal\n\nDelete stopped environments automatically.\n\n**Which environments will be deleted?**\n\n- The environment has already been **stopped** for more than a month.\n- The environment [is not protected](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html).\n\nThis should also cover https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225794.\n\n## Example\n\nGiven you have the following .gitlab-ci.yml:\n\n```yaml\nreview:\n  environment:\n    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME\n    auto_stop_in: 1 week\n\nproduction:\n  environment: production\n```\n\nThe outcome is:\n\n- If the `review/something` environment is running for a week, it'll be **stopped** by [environment auto-stop feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#environments-auto-stop) feature.\n- If the `review/something` environment has been stopped for a month, it'll be **deleted** by the new feature.\n- The `production` environment will never be stopped automatically.\n- If the `production` environment has been stopped by manual operation, it **won't** be deleted because the environment was not stopped by [environment auto-stop feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#environments-auto-stop) feature.\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-06T07:49:15.005Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T02:24:23.021Z","closed_at":"2022-01-13T02:24:22.129Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Environment Management","GitLab Free","Next Up","Technical Writing","UI text","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","customer","devops::release","direction","environments","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWhen a security vulnerability was previously detected but is no longer found in a subsequent scan, the status of the vulnerability will remain unchanged. This forces an individual to have to manually set the status to \"Resolved\" in order to accurately describe the status of the vulnerability. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nA [scan result security policy](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6237) at the project/group/instance level that gives GitLab the permission to automatically resolve security vulnerabilities when they are no longer being detected in subsequent scans. This can be further broken down to allow selecting specific scanners to allow automatic resolution. That way, teams can decide more granularly which removed vulnerabilities need a person to review before closing versus which ones can be trusted to the automation.\n\n**Note**: The previous solution of a setting has been replaced with a [new policy-based approach](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233846#note_717504640).\n\n### Further Details\n\nFor Product companies like GitLab, it makes sense to keep track of vulnerabilities over time. One version could have been shipped with a critical vulnerability, which means a new security release even though the security issue has been remediated since.  \nFor SaaS companies, the workflow is different. With Continuous Delivery, the state of the service is often the state of the latest pipeline in `master` (or any other main branch). In this case, the users don't really care about what occurred in the past.  \nThey would probably use more [notifications](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/4905) in this case than this dashboard.\n\n### Requirements\n\n## Requirements \n\n- The auto-resolved vulnerability should have an activity item stating that it was resolved because of X policy (and ideally, a link to the policy).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-05T23:40:10.169Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T03:17:31.894Z","closed_at":"2023-01-05T00:32:30.922Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","SecurityPM","Technical Writing","UX","auto updated","customer","devops::govern","group::threat insights","internal customer","potential proposal","section::sec","tw::finished","type::feature","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":4415483,"username":"beckalippert","name":"Becka Lippert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4415483/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/beckalippert"}],"author":{"id":4788291,"username":"bgadberry","name":"Brett Gadberry","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/43a9f9f32340f36bb7f5bacb5f1cf421?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bgadberry"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4415483,"username":"beckalippert","name":"Becka Lippert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4415483/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/beckalippert"},"user_notes_count":103,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":44,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233846","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233846","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233846/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233846/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#233846","relative":"#233846","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#233846"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5708,"epic":{"id":243778,"iid":5708,"title":"Auto-resolve vulnerabilities when not found in subsequent scans","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5708","group_id":9970,"human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e28\u003c/strong\u003e days elapsed"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69484992,"iid":233844,"project_id":278964,"title":"Elasticsearch named queries","description":"From https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233818#note_391485955 we can use [`_name`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-named-queries-and-filters.html) in our queries to help us understand the different parts and how they link back to the code that generated them.
