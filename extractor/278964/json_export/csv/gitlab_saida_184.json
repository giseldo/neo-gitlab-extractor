Now, this page also includes the number of open issues, number of open merge requests, and number of forks.\nHowever, this information is leaking to  users with restricted project access. For public and internal projects, this information is leaked when the project's issues and MRs are configured to be accessible only by project members. For private projects, the number of MRs is leaked also to Guest project members, who, according to the GitLab permission system, don't have access to MRs.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nTested on GitLab 11.7.0-rc5-ee\n\n1. Create a public project, restrict the access of issues and merge requests to project members only. In this example, I named the project `test-project-page`\n2. Create new issue and a merge request in this project\n3. As a non-project member, visit the projects page. Here you can search for the project since it's public by visiting the page: `https://example.gitlab.com/explore/projects?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026name=test-project-page\u0026sort=latest_activity_desc`\n4. The search result is leaking the number of issues and merge requests, although as a non-project member, you don't have access to this. You can also see this in the attached screenshot.\n\n## Steps to mitigate\n\nOnly display number of issues or MRs if user has permission to it\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers who don't have access to issues and MRs the number of open items.\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [leak-project-page.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/480960/407359/leak-project-page.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-16T18:17:33.797Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T15:42:12.256Z","closed_at":"2021-01-22T15:42:12.046Z","closed_by":{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle Gill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554599/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_gill"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","HackerOne","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::create","group::code review","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::risk-acceptance","severity::4","type::bug","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-03-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26193","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/26193","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/26193/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/26193/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#26193","relative":"#26193","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#26193"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1322,"epic":{"id":7382,"iid":1322,"title":"Security: Confidential S2/S3","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1322","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17385829,"iid":9233,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove second primary button from geo empty state","description":"### Summary\n\nDuring the update in !8576, we've missed deduplicating the primary buttons available in the Geo empty state.\n\n\u003e There is only one primary button since there can only be one primary button per form.

\"may expose confidential information\" warning needs explanation","description":"## Problem\n\nI knew we could promote issues to epics, and went to use it for the first time. I found https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#promoting-an-issue-to-an-epic and typed `/promote` into the comment field and saw:\n\n![image](/uploads/763f46017f7b270883d3b2718ea04d29/image.png)\n\nI thought: \"Oh no, what am I about to expose?\". And googled `site:gitlab.com \"may expose confidential information\"` and got nothing useful:\n\n![image](/uploads/46ee2c18113e8d7296c1459f0700b2e2/image.png)\n\nAt this point, many users will stop and never use the action.\n\nAs a GitLab dev, I found the string in the code, and found the MR and issue, but I'm actually still a little worried something unexpected could happen. Should the warning be displayed at all on a public issue of a public project?\n\nIf we want users to use the action, they need to know with more certainty what will happen if they use it.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- [ ] Add full explanation about the warning on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#promoting-an-issue-to-an-epic\n\n## Add-on proposals\n\n- [ ] Hide the warning if irrelevant\n- [ ] Ideally link to the doc from the warning, but that's probably not possible on the select?\n\n## Design proposal\n1.  The most pressing requirement here is **exposing this warning only when it is relevant to the user**, and not in every issue.\n2.  Update the warning to better correlate this warning to the confidential banner, using the style of our [alert](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/design-gitlab-specs/alerts-spec-previews/) component. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/90daad5edfed17cf073c3685bf4e7bb8/confidentalalert.png\" width=\"600\"\u003e\n\nHere are specs for the cell: https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/alexis/ee%239125-promote-spec-previews/\n\nSimplified specs below:\n*  Banner height: 24px\n*  Banner background color: `#FFF1DE`\n*  Banner font color: `#A35200`\n*  `Confidential` icon, 4px spacing between icon and text\n\n3.  Update the banner copy that appears after a user has promoted their issue to `Promoted issue to epic. Information in this issue is no longer confidential as epics are public to group members.`\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/039d6bf7995b03dcfabda5791a2859ea/Confidentalconfirmation.png\"

Problem\n\nAs mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6306#note_130326757:\n\n\u003e A customer has some kind of network configuration or security requirements that, for example, causes them to try to use IPs inaccessible to users as Geo node URLs. So they have working DB replication, but broken syncing. If I recall correctly, we ask them to make the Geo node URLs match the `external_url`, but they can't or don't want to. I've seen this in multiple support calls.\n\n## Possible solution\n\nSuggested by @nick.thomas https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6306#note_78135896:\n\n\u003e decouple the Geo node identity from from the `external_url` completely. This may have some accessory benefits during failover.\n\n### Possible implementations\n\nDescribed by @vsizov in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6306#note_130316857:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nThis one is also possible and should be fairly easy to implement. As we decouple identity we will need to provide some alternative. I can think of two options:\n\n- We specify all the possible URLs for Geo secondary node in the Geo node configuration and so secondary can identify itself by matching request_uri with one of those.\n- We can identify the node by setting some name in the Geo node configuration (DB) and specify this name in `gitlab.rb` configuration file. So by matching those, the node can identify itself.

It seems that problem still exists in version 11.6.2 CE\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nLooks like there is a problem related to mime-type detection and encoding when files are uploaded to WebIDE. I've prepared four files to show the problem:\n\n``` sh\n$ file -i *.{sql,txt} | sort\nascii.sql:     text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nascii.txt:     text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nnon-ascii.sql: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nnon-ascii.txt: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n$ sha1sum *.{sql,txt} | sort -k2,2\n22fe79a8ad71c02c63d5b2c10c349064dd762ce1  ascii.sql\n22fe79a8ad71c02c63d5b2c10c349064dd762ce1  ascii.txt\n0f7b4136fcbe71359340241e91a20f0ad4386552  non-ascii.sql\n0f7b4136fcbe71359340241e91a20f0ad4386552  non-ascii.txt\n```\n\n`ascii.*` files have different extensions only and contain only ASCII characters. All files are attached below.\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFile name      |After upload to GitLab\n---------------|-----------------------------\n[ascii.sql](/uploads/2d2d323c4d19f5cf402b84a1d0eaa43d/ascii.sql) | ![ascii-sql](/uploads/ebb528f5dbbf185e2c42b2c52def81e3/ascii-sql.png)\n[ascii.txt](/uploads/a693f182362b72cdc339fcaeda0130d6/ascii.txt) | ![ascii-txt](/uploads/7f2dc97eb94bd6fad5719519f73d6f15/ascii-txt.png)\n[non-ascii.sql](/uploads/bae0f91b7617bcc628102597bd6a6db5/non-ascii.sql) | ![non-ascii-sql](/uploads/9a07b4125f96afc971a2f90c51ab9fbe/non-ascii-sql.png)\n[non-ascii.txt](/uploads/49055681eecb035a23bf748df053de7c/non-ascii.txt) | ![non-ascii-txt](/uploads/b678062923467a433cf04c6692ce0c54/non-ascii-txt.png)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWell, I think this is obvious - use mime-type to detect if given file is a plain text file.\n\nFirst two files were uploaded correctly.\n\nThird file should not be uploaded in base64 encoding, because it is plain text file (`text/plain`). After upload it should look like this:\n\n![expected-non-ascii-sql](/uploads/04303d54ee0a69ebd1f7e1f0cd4cefd2/expected-non-ascii-sql.png)\n\nFourth file seems to be interpreted as plain text file just because it has `*.txt` extension, but encoding is wrong. After upload it should look like this:\n\n![expected-non-ascii-txt](/uploads/6a3f747737295a6f1cbdfafb1a95de4b/expected-non-ascii-txt.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement mime-type checking on the frontend via JS: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/26113#note_239792655\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n```\n$ sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\nCurrent User:   git\nUsing RVM:      no\nRuby Version:   2.5.3p105\nGem Version:    2.7.6\nBundler Version:1.16.6\nRake Version:   12.3.1\nRedis Version:  3.2.12\nGit Version:    2.18.1\nSidekiq Version:5.2.3\nGo Version:     unknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:        11.6.2\nRevision:       4d0c547\nDirectory:      /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:     postgresql\nURL:            https://\u003cREDACTED\u003e\nHTTP Clone URL: https://\u003cREDACTED\u003e/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:  git@\u003cREDACTED\u003e:some-group/some-project.git\nUsing LDAP:     yes\nUsing Omniauth: yes\nOmniauth Providers:\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:        8.4.3\nRepository storage paths:\n- default:      /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nHooks:          /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell/hooks\nGit:            /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n```\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n```\n$ sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

Packages can be internally built and maintained, or sourced from a public repository. Based on our user research, we’ve learned that most projects use a 50/50 mix of public vs. private packages. When installing packages, the order in which they are found and downloaded is very important, as downloading/using an incorrect package or version of a package can introduce breaking changes and security vulnerabilities into their pipelines. \n\n[Sidney](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney) wants to rely solely on GitLab as a universal package manager so that they can reduce costs and drive operational efficiencies. However, GitLab only supports privately hosted package repositories, which only accounts for half of their team's use cases. In addition, the naming conventions enforced by the GitLab Package Registry, make it impossible for organizations with many teams and many developers to use GitLab’s offering.\n\n### Target audience\n\n- [Systems Administrator](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney)\n\n### Proposal\nInvestigate how we can expand the Package Registry to support the creation, usage and management of remote and virtual repositories. The output of this issue should be a planned implementation strategy and set of issues added to the epic [Expand the GitLab Package Registry by adding the ability to connect and setup remote and virtual repositories](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2614)\n\n#### User flow\n[Sydney](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney) would like to configure GitLab to function as a universal package manager for their team. They read that GitLab will allow them to add remote and virtual package repositories, which will help them to manage all of their group's dependencies (internal and external) in one central place. \n\n1. Sydney opens the GitLab app and navigates to their group.\n1. They navigate to `Packages \u0026 Registries` --\u003e `Dependency Proxy`\n1. They have not used this feature before and they see an empty state page with another great GitLab graphic and a link to the documentation.\n1. They navigate to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/\n1. They read about how to add and configure remote and virtual repositories using either the API or the UI. \n1. They switch back to the GitLab and decide to play around in the UI.\n1. They click a button to add a new repository.\n1. They are prompted to select the format and type.\n1. They choose to create an npm remote repository.\n1. They enter a name for the repository.\n1. They see that they need to enter a URL where the repository is hosted and they copy and paste a link to www.npmjs.com.\n1. They define a maximum package age which will define how long to cache artifacts before rechecking the remote repository. \n1. They see the option to define storage and that it's set to `default` which will use what was defined when [installing GitLab.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/dependency_proxy.html#changing-the-local-storage-path)\n1. They see that a box is checked by default to enforce content validation or to restrict usage to files appropriate for npm. \n1. They see that a box is checked enabling a feature to cache packages for future use.\n1. They see an option for a cache expiration policy and that it has been set to `30 days`.\n1. They decide to leave it set at 30 days. \n1. They see an option to enable authentication and enter a user name and password. \n1. They see HTTP Request settings and check the defaults to ensure they make sense. \n1. They see that GitLab has defined defaults for the number of connection retries and for connection timeouts. \n1. They leave the defaults set.\n1. They hit create. \n1. They view and copy a code snippet that they can run to quickly configure npm to point to that repository, so they can test that it works. \n1. They run `npm install` and it works.\n1. They create another hosted repository, repeating the above steps. \n1. Sydney decides to create a Virtual repository to try grouping the previously created remote repositories.\n1. Sydney clicks a button to create a new repository and when prompted, selects an npm + virtual repository.\n1. They enter a name for the repository.\n1. They leave the storage and content validation set to default.\n1. They see an option to add any existing npm repositories to and that it allows them to order them. \n1. They are happy with the ordering and they create the repository.\n1. They view and copy a code snippet that they can run to quickly configure npm to point to that repository, so they can test that it works. \n1. They choose to install a package that is in the second repository and not the first and attempt to install a package, using the new virtual endpoint. It works!\n1. Sydney would like to add some of their already create, private npm repositories to the group. They do so and define an ordered list of hosted and remote repositories using one virtual endpoint.\n1. Sydney shares that endpoint with their development team and says \"When you are installing packages using Gitlab CI, you can now simply use `http://gitlab.example.com/repository/npm-all/` and it will automatically resolve the correct package, in the following order:....\"\n1. Sydney navigates back to the Dependency Proxy and views all of their repositories in one place. \n\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Hosted vs. Remote vs. Virtual repositories\n- A `hosted` package repository is one that is hosted within your GitLab instance. Currently, we only supported hosted repositories. It is likely that a group will have several hosted repositories. For example, project-level, feature-level or for Maven it's common to create a `dev`, `snapshots` and `releases` repositories. \n- A `remote` package repository is any repository that is hosted outside of your GitLab instance. The most common examples of these are https://www.npmjs.com/ and https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central, but they also may be hosted on an S3 instance or within another product.  \n- A `virtual` package repository is one that groups an ordered list of `remote` and `hosted` repositories and exposes them using a single endpoint, such as `http://gitlab.example.com/repository/npm-all/`.\n\n#### Considerations\n\n##### Instance vs. Group-level vs. Project-level\nWe recently adding request forwarding for npm packages at the instance-level. So, if you try to install an npm package from your GitLab hosted repository, and it's not there, we will search npmjs.org. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure this feature makes sense at the instance level. \n- The Dependency Proxy is at the group level, and I expect this feature will be built with it.\n- We don't want to hide this functionality in the instance level admin screens. \n\n##### How does this impact publishing\nAlthough this feature does impact publishing packages, in that you are creating repositories to publish to, it won't change much. The big change is that you will be able to install packages using the URL for your `virtual` repository.\n\n##### Which formats to support\nWe are basing our prioritization decision on the popularity of each format. The current priority order is:\n- npm\n- Maven\n- NuGet\n- PyPI\n- Conan\n\n##### Design questions\n- Where should a user go to add, update and delete package repositories\n- What information do they need to include when adding a new repository? How does this differ from format to format?\n- How does the group repositories in the Virtual repository?\n- Following the GitLab principle of [convention over configuration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#convention-over-configuration) how can we ensure users have a good default experience and that we help them to limit configuration?\n\n##### Technical considerations\n\n##### Network requests + time outs\nA virtual package repository can include a hosted, remote or an other virtual repository. We need to have a limit here for ~performance reasons. The number of remote repositories we request must be limited: these will be pinged in sequence when `npm` or `yarn` is executing `install`. In other words, we're making network requests within a network request -\u003e there is a hard timeout of 60s on production but we should aim for a lower time. \n\nOn a positive note, the cache feature will definitely help here (hitting the cache instead of hitting remote repository is a gain) but we still need to support the worst scenario where the cache is empty and not used at all.\n\n##### GraphQL\nWe will consider implementing this in GraphQL to allow greater flexibility and performance in the UI.\n\n#### API\nThe API will allow you to:\n- Create and configure a package repository.\n- Update the configurations of an existing repository.\n- List your group's repositories.\n- Delete a repository.\n\n##### Attributes\n\n###### Hosted repository attributes (sample)\nThere are likely more attributes that we should consider, but starting with:\n- \"key\": \"hosted-repo1\",\n  - \"type\" : \"hosted\",\n  - \"packageType\": \"maven\" | \"nuget\" | \"npm\" | \"composer\" | \"pypi\" | \"go\" | \"conan\" |\n  - \"description\": \"The local repository public description\",\n  - \"notes\": \"Notes\"\n\nOther attributes we should consider\n- Allow duplicate uploads\n- Enforce semantic versioning \n- Any additional format-specific settings, such as how we version Maven snapshots.\n\n###### Remote repository attributes (sample)\n- \"key\": \"remote-repo1\",\n  - \"type\" : \"remote\",\n  - \"packageType\": \"maven\" | \"nuget\" | \"npm\" | \"composer\" | \"pypi\" | \"go\" | \"conan\" \n  - \"url\" : \"https://www.npmjs.com/\",\n  - \"description\": \"Description\",\n  - \"notes\": \"Notes\"\n  - \"username\": \"user\",\n  - \"password\": \"pass\",\n\nOther attributes we should consider\n- Socket timeouts in MS\n- Set public registries as default remote repositories\n- Store packages locally (caching)\n\n###### Virtual repository attributes (sample)\n- \"key\": \"virtual-repo1\",\n  + \"rclass\" : \"virtual\",\n  - \"type\" : \"remote\",\n  - \"packageType\": \"maven\" | \"nuget\" | \"npm\" | \"composer\" | \"pypi\" | \"go\" | \"conan\" |\n  - \"repositories\": [\"hosted-repo1\", \"remote-repo1\", \"remote-repo2\", \"virtual-repo2\"]\n  - \"description\": \"Description\",\n  - \"notes\": \"Some internal notes\",\n\nOther attributes we should consider\n- Exclude packages matching a given criteria (Dependency Firewall)\n\n##### Future iterations will include\n- Use policies to enforce compliance and security regulations\n- View usage data\n- Cache frequently used packages\n\n### Permissions\n- The ability to CRUD package repositories will be limited to Maintainers and Owners\n\n### Documentation\n- [Permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)\n- [Packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nSuccess looks like we have give users a way of creating package repositories that meet all of their use cases. \n\n#### Measure\n- Count # of repositories created, updated, listed and deleted (segment by repository type and format)\n\n### Links / references\n- [Problem Validation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35886)\n- [Demos of Nexus Repository feature](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ci-cd/package/#nexus-repository-oss)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-11T14:31:28.340Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T09:03:16.962Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T07:57:05.168Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Proxy","Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","customer","devops::package","group::package registry","npm Registry","package:active","ruby","sec-planning::in-progress","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":489558,"username":"dimitrieh","name":"Dimitrie Hoekstra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/489558/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dimitrieh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":97,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":13,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9164","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9164","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9164/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9164/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9164","relative":"#9164","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#9164"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2614,"epic":{"id":19231,"iid":2614,"title":"Expand the GitLab Package Registry by adding the ability to connect and setup remote and virtual repositories","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2614","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24687500,"iid":26111,"project_id":278964,"title":"Submodules to Github Gists appear with the wrong URL","description":"### Summary\n\nGit submodules that link to GitHub gists link to the wrong URL on the web UI.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. `git submodule add \u003cpaste link of any GitHub Gist\u003e`\n2.

Please login via your group's SSO at https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in`?\"\n* Users will need to log in via the UI and then attempt the Git operation again.\n* Enabling Git SSO check should be a configuration option at the group level.\n* Credentials that are not tied to human users should not have an SSO check enforced (Project Access token, deploy keys, etc).\n* SSH and HTTPS Git activity should both be checked.\n\nNote from @jamedjo: \"Add check to UserAccess and user_access_denied_reason.rb to be displayed from GitAccess#check_active_user!. UserAccess changes can either be in the policy (:push_code and :read_project) or could be in UserAccess directly.\"\n\n## Issue readiness\n\n* [x]  Product: issue description is accurate with an acceptable proposal for an MVC\n* [x]  Engineering: issue is implementable with few remaining questions, is sufficiently broken down, and is able to be estimated","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-11T01:22:45.277Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T19:57:35.399Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T14:44:12.971Z","closed_by":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Next Up","authentication","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","gitlab.com","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","missed:11.11","missed:11.8","missed:12.0","missed:12.1","planning priority","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item","release post item::in review","saml","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"},"user_notes_count":78,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":13,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9152","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9152","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9152/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9152/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9152","relative":"#9152","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#9152"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5609,"epic":{"id":226275,"iid":5609,"title":"SAML SSO Enforcement in API and CLI","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5609","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24687481,"iid":26103,"project_id":278964,"title":"Disclosure of Any User's Private Group Info by `available_group_templates`","description":"**[HackerOne report #475240](https://hackerone.com/reports/475240)** by `ngalog` on 2019-01-06, assigned to `asaba`:\n\n**Summary:**\nLately gitlab allow user to create project from group template, the newly introduced endpoint didn't perform access control check, allowing unauthorized user to access the private group info of other users.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n- Login gitlab.com\n- visit https://gitlab.com/users/ashleyjohnson/available_group_templates\n- In burp send the request to repeater\n- add this line in header\n\n```\nX-CSRF-Token: testing\n```\n\nThe full request should look like \n\n```\nGET /users/ashleyjohnson/available_group_templates HTTP/1.1\nHost: gitlab.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;

Then, users will access Geo through a common name/load balancer. The load balancer intelligently routes the user to the closest Geo node. This is useful in large enterprises because users don't need to know where the Geo nodes are or what their specific URL is.\n\nThis currently doesn't work with Geo due to OAuth. When attempting to authenticate via the load balanced name, OAuth fails with 'Invalid URI' on the GitLab primary. However, authentication works fine when accessing a specific Geo node via it's proper URL. This seems to be due to the way we do name matching.\n\n\n### Solution\n\nMake it possible to specify an alternate URL for Geo Node. This URL has to be added to a Doorkeeper application. When I experimented locally I did it like this:\n\n```ruby\nDoorkeeper::Application.last.redirect_uri # =\u003e \"http://s1.gitlab.com/oauth/geo/callback\"\nnew_redirect_uri = \"http://s1.gitlab.com/oauth/geo/callback http://secondary.gitlab.com/oauth/geo/callback\"\nDoorkeeper::Application.last.update(redirect_uri: new_redirect_uri)\n```\n\nThis issue will probably need some help of frontend team. The administrator will need somewhere on the UI to specify these URLs.\n\nWe'll show the alternate URL and sync URL info in the 'Other information' section, illustrated below:\n\n![image](/uploads/8cccc2ec23ef97aea2828d92fa8a5dc7/image.png)\n\nRefactoring the form in 'Edit node' so it aligns with our form guidelines will make it easier to read and use.

This is not a scalable solution, since you cannot label every single issue with a priority label. Furthermore, is very difficult to re-order issues quickly/easily using labels.\n- We have a priority / priority label sort for issues lists, but they suffer the problem above, since they are based on priority labels.\n- You can order issues within an issue board, but the space is very limiting. Even if you use the `Open` list, it is very difficult to see a large list of issues. To mitigate the problem, you can narrow down the issues to a small subset, but that defeats the purpose of backlog grooming, where you want a large set of issues visible, that you can continuously groom over time.\n\n### Solution\n\n- Make the issues lists (all versions of them, including the dashboard list, group list, and project list) support manual reordering, exactly like how you re-order issues in a board.\n- In particular, there is a new dropdown selection called `Manual ordering`. If you select that mode, then you can drag and drop issues in the list view.\n- The order is saved to the system. The relative ordering, for any two given issues in the instance, is stored and saved and used for all issue lists views, and all board views. That means that if you re-order in one place, then it is reflected everywhere else in the instance. In other words, board lists are inherently always use the `Manual ordering` option. And there is no other option.\n- The order is shared in epic lists to be consistent. I.e. if you make an ordering re-arrangement in an epic list, it is reflected elsewhere as well.\n- It will be difficult to groom a large backlog, especially if the list page only shows 20 issues per paginated page. To solve this, we need to do infinite scrolling and/or have some way to move an issue from one paginated page to another page easily.\n- If you create a new issue while in this mode, then the issue would show all the way at the end.\n- You should probably be able to re-order issues in the closed and all tabs too.\n\n\n### Proposal\n![Screen_Shot_2019-01-23_at_12.25.20_PM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/347f4efd2ab41cdafb495ba79aa4ef39/Screen_Shot_2019-01-23_at_12.25.20_PM.png)\n\n* Add `Manual` option in sort dropdown\n* List displays 100 issues at a time\n* Issues use new drag-and-drop style (similar to issue boards)\n* Users can drag issues anywhere on the list, at any time. The list is automatically saved in the current order.\n\nNote- I opened an MR for the manual order styles (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/9278/diffs).

This is not a scalable solution for our enterprise customers as it prevents users from using two-factor authentication for their GitLab accounts.\n\n### Intended users\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/research/personas#persona-sasha)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/research/personas#persona-devon)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Background Details\nWith milestone 12.2, we extend the [Personal Access Token to be OAuth2 compatible](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/63438) and allow for [authentication with the PAT](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9140). This issue will add support for `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.\n\n#### User flow\n1. A Javascript (node.js) developer at a Premium customer wants to start using GitLab CI to publish NPM packages.\n2. Since the feature is enabled at the instance level, the developer can easily enable the feature at the project level by navigating to Settings-\u003eGeneral-\u003ePermissions and enabling 'Packages'\n3. They click on 'Packages' and see the empty state page that directs them to the [NPM documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/packages/npm_registry.html)\n4. They see an updated version of [this section of documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/packages/npm_registry.html#) that documents how to authenticate to the NPM registry from GitLab CI using `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.\n5. The user copies the example `gitlab-ci.yml` from the documentation and creates a pipeline to test publishing their NPM packages.\n6. The `gitlab-ci.yml` template allows the user to authenticate and publish a package from GitLab CI.\n7. The user celebrates and if they've been using OAuth they go and enable 2FA for their GitLab account.\n8. They begin using the NPM Registry and GitLab CI to publish and pull all of their packages.\n\n### Proposal\nAllow users to authenticate to the GitLab NPM Registry from GitLab CI using `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.\n\n### Permissions and Security\nFrom [CI build permissions model](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.html)\nIt is important to note that we have a few types of users:\n\n- Administrators: CI jobs created by Administrators will not have access to all GitLab projects, but only to projects and container images of projects that the administrator is a member of. That means that if a project is either public or internal users have access anyway, but if a project is private, the Administrator will have to be a member of it in order to have access to it via another project’s job.\n- External users: CI jobs created by external users will have access only to projects to which user has at least reporter access. This rules out accessing all internal projects by default.\n\n### Documentation\n- [NPM Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/packages/npm_registry.html)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nSuccess looks like we allow users to use the CI token for authentication with the NPM Registry, so that they can seamlessly use GitLab CI to build and publish npm packages.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \nThis feature will be focused on Director and Executives, as it is a Premium/Silver and Ultimate/Gold feature. \nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Links / references\n- [Discussion about unifying tokens and why it's hard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/62295#note_181974192)\n- [Discussion about personal access tokens](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20993#note_173132336)\n- [CI Permissions Model](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.html)\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-08T16:36:25.692Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T21:17:18.146Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T07:32:46.121Z","closed_by":{"id":2187482,"username":"ashmckenzie","name":"Ash McKenzie","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2187482/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ashmckenzie"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Product Vision FY20","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::package","direction","documentation","group::package registry","maturity::viable","missed-deliverable","missed:11.8","missed:12.3","missed:12.4","movingtogitlab","package:active","potential proposal","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":4262651,"username":"ggelatti","name":"Giorgenes Gelatti","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4262651/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ggelatti"}],"author":{"id":926632,"username":"joshlambert","name":"Joshua Lambert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0bdc5209b11e9c0953f80234dcb4ffb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/joshlambert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4262651,"username":"ggelatti","name":"Giorgenes Gelatti","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4262651/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ggelatti"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":25,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9104","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9104","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9104/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9104/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9104","relative":"#9104","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#9104"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1241,"epic":{"id":6538,"iid":1241,"title":"Improve the usability of the GitLab Package Registry","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1241","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17683218,"iid":9427,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add runbook link to assets in Releases - MVC","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nUsers want to be able to attach release plans to their Releases in GitLab.

If the user enters an invalid URL, the input should display an error state and helper message.\n- User should be able to add a name to the Link in the `Link title` input field.\n- User should be able to add multiple links to the form. By clicking the `Add another link` option, a new set of `URL` and `Link title` form fields are displayed below the existing ones.\n- User should be able to remove a link from the form by clicking the `Remove` button next to the fields.\n  - A tooltip should be displayed when hovering the button. It should read `Remove link`.\n  - Clicking the button removes the fields from the UI.\n  - If there is only one (1) entry for a link in the row, and the user clicks the option to remove it, the information should be removed but the input fields remain in the UI.

After a short while, the toast will ease-out with the opposite motion. | \n| If the user has the \"Hide dismissed\" toggle off, no motion will be applied to the vulnerability and no toast will appear.

It is difficult to use the search box \"jump to\"  dropdown using keyboard","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen using a keyboard to navigate Gitlab.com, it is difficult to navigate to the items in the dropdown using arrow-keys or tab. \n\nIn addition, the dropdown items only appear if one enters the search box, leaves, and returns - otherwise one only sees \"Loading...\"\n\nThe dropdown items then cannot be dismissed, blocking part of the screen until one leaves the page.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the tab key to navigate any gitlab.com page. It will currently start at the search box, so if you find yourself anywhere else, use alt-tab to get back to it. (the fact that it starts at search is a bit confusing, as well)\n\nTo encourage the dropdown items to appear, tab out and then alt tab back in. At this point, you cannot access the dropdown items.\n\nHowever, if one continues tabbing, after the \"new\" icon and dropdown, the focus will be on the items in the search dropdown. \n\nThis is very confusing behavior for someone who can see the screen but prefers or requires keyboard use. \n\nI am not entirely sure if it's also confusing for a user of a screen reader, as the dropdown options appear to allow jumping to things rather than searching.\n\nThe dropdown items will now not go away unless one leaves the current page.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nThis is what you see when you first enter the search box using the keyboard.\n![Screenshot_2019-01-05_at_11.48.46](/uploads/9d337d2d194366f36b25fd8bb6f45de8/Screenshot_2019-01-05_at_11.48.46.png)\n\nThe next time one enters the search box using the keyboard, one sees this. It will not go away, either. You can only access these if you first tab to the new icon and dropdown to the left of the search box, and then tab will bring you to each of those.\n![Screenshot_2019-01-05_at_11.49.31](/uploads/3c69d4eb43a8c8e64af4d21714722e35/Screenshot_2019-01-05_at_11.49.31.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on gitlab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-05T16:58:34.984Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:56:42.401Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T19:26:35.550Z","closed_by":{"id":516904,"username":"tauriedavis","name":"Taurie Davis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/516904/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tauriedavis"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","Manage [DEPRECATED]","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","accessibility","advanced search","devops::data_stores","group::global search","project","section::enablement","severity::4","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Given: Making changes to a Markdown file in a repo located at: https://example.com/dreamhost/virtkick/kubekick/blob/master/docs/50-troubleshooting.md\n2. When: Markdown link to URL `/docs/0-setup.md#step-5-inspect-logs`\n3. Then: render HTML link to URL `https://example.com/dreamhost/virtkick/kubekick/blob/master/docs/0-setup.md#step-5-inspect-logs`\n   - As per the spec at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links\n4. Actual: render HTML link to URL `https://example.com/dreamhost/virtkick/kubekick/master/docs/0-setup.md#step-5-inspect-logs``\n\nContext: this ONLY happens if docs/0-setup.md doesn't exit in the repo. If docs/0-setup.md exists, the link is correct.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Edit any Markdown file in GitLab visual editor.\n2. Add anywhere: `[Kubekick guide, Inspect logs](/docs/0-setup.md#step-5-inspect-logs)`\n3. Click Preview.\n4. Hover on the new link.\n5. Note the generated URL is missing the `blob` part.\n\n![image](/uploads/b3b3482147c9cc8924833628b9d8e89c/image.png)\n\nGitLab: 11.6.2-ee\n\n### Why it matters?\n\n\u0026lt;DevilsAdvocate666\u0026gt; If I'm linking to a file that doesn't exist, why does it matter that the generated URL is still up to spec?\n\nBecause when I first make a mistake, and link to 0-setup.md instead of 10-setup.md, I'll check a link and it'll be invalid. If I spot lack of `/blob/` part in the link instead of my human typo `10` vs `0`, I'll think it's GitLab to blame, take down the company for GitLab upgrade (to make sure it's not a bug in GitLab), and when still not working, submit THIS ticket, only to realize that it was a typo at later point (but GitLab's inconsistency in generating links too). \n\n### Mentions\n\n@markglenfletcher @jramsay

The use case of what triggers this is that a branch was created as a hotfix into a previous release, but then determined not to be a hotfix, and rebased and retargeted into master (in that specific order of actions). \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a `new` branch from `target`, add a couple commits to `new`. Create an MR from `new` to `target`. Rebase `new` such that it has a few (2+) thousand commits that aren't in `target`.

Some customers don't use CI/CD and would like the Kubernetes menu item hidden in this case. These options are [hidden on the project level when builds are turned off](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47631). There is not a group or instance level setting to hide the Kubernetes menu item.\n\nCustomer ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/110840\n\n### Target audience\n\nFrom the customer:\n\n```\nthis will bring confusion to our developers and, more importantly, customers that have groups in our instance.\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nFrom the customer:\n\n```\nwe've just updated our test instance from 11.3-stable-ee to \n11-6-stable-ee and noticed there's now a Kubernetes menuitem on \ngrouplevel. We don't use autodevops, docker, kubernetes etc. so we need \nto get rid of the button before we roll this out to production.\n...\nAs we're not using docker, Kubernetes, etc. this will bring confusion \nto our developers and, more importantly, customers that have groups in \nour instance. We need to have this removed on group level as well.\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\n* disabling Kubernetes integrations at the instance/group level should disable it at the levels below as well\n* when the feature is disabled, hide the menu \"Kubernetes\" in groups and \"Infrastructure/Kubernetes clusters\" in projects\n* if the integration is disabled, we should show a text about it at the settings' place\n  * if disabled at the instance level, show the text under the group and project settings\n  * if disabled at the group level, show the test under subgroup and project settings\n* disabling the integration should disable the related APIs too\n  * when disabled at a group, it should not be possible to\n    * register an agent in any of the projects within that group\n    * share an agent with any of the projects or groups within that group\n    * the previously registered agents should stop working\n    * the previously shared agent connections should stop working\n\nInstead of Agent for Kubernetes.

That means, when `LfsDownloadLinkListService` asks for the `oids`' links in `get_download_links`, it will be using invalid credentials, `http://t%2Bu:a%23b@example.com/info/lfs/objects/batch`, and it will also build invalid links.\n\nTo fix this we need to unencode the user and password before requesting any data.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-26T16:01:07.927Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T09:38:09.063Z","closed_at":"2022-10-31T03:04:04.044Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","DEPRECATED_import","Git LFS","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","group::source code","missed-deliverable","missed:11.10","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n- Attachments, LFS objects, and job artifacts are checksummed on secondary nodes after transfer, compared with the stored checksum, and rejected if mismatched.\n- Ignore if checksum doesn't exist.

But if the branch is merged externally and then pushed (e.g., via Git CLI), the badge doesn't appear until another commit is made.\n\nDiscovered while working on a test during a gitlab-ce~2278656 tech interview: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/48529\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a branch in a project, using Git CLI not GitLab UI.\n1. Push the branch.\n1. Merge the branch into master (still using Git).\n1. Push master.\n1. Check the branches page. It should show a `merged` badge, but it doesn't.\n1. Make another commit to master and push it.\n1. Check the branches page again. Now shows the `merged` badge.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/mlapierre/merge-test/-/branches\n\n![merge](/uploads/701ee572fb8ed3d0d3b0ce8702d9e236/merge.png).\n\nAll git operations were done via Git CLI. Branch `merge-me` was merged first and then `merge-me-too` was merged, but it doesn't show a `merged` badge.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe branches page doesn't show a `merged` badge even though the branch has been merged.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe branches page shows a `merged` badge for all merged branches\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n/cc @jramsay @DouweM","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-18T17:19:15.023Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T22:51:07.854Z","closed_at":"2022-11-28T22:51:07.832Z","closed_by":{"id":655908,"username":"mlapierre","name":"Mark Lapierre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/655908/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlapierre"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","SUS::Impacting","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","repository","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

/users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#user-creation) will return `password, reset_password are missing, at least one parameter must be provided` even though an external user ID and provider have been specified in the function parameters.\n\nThis should not happen for a user with an external authentication provider (in my case LDAP) as the password storage is handled by LDAP and not Gitlab.\n\n*This is important for an external user raking task to be possible in order to assign users projects etc prior to their first self sign in.*\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCall [POST /users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#user-creation) specifying with the following parameter keys:\n\n* email\n* password: `null`, or don't define\n* reset_password: `false`, or don't define\n* username: User's LDAP UID\n* name\n* extern_uid: User's LDAP DN\n* provider: LDAP instance name as per your Gitlab configuration\n* skip_confirmation: `true`\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API function returns `password, reset_password are missing, at least one parameter must be provided`.\n\nIf you define `reset_password` as `false` in the parameters then the API function instead returns `\"password\" can't be blank`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUser should be created successfully without a password or the requirement to reset their password so the user can authenticate using their LDAP credentials in the same way they can do so when signing in for the first time.\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n```\nSystem

Using this we can actually trick the user into visiting our URL when they click our username. \n\n**Description:** When setting your name, using \u0026lt;a href=x\u0026gt; will render a valid link, except using \u0026lt;a href=https://www.evilsite.com/\u0026gt;hi\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; will not work. However if we use \u0026lt;a href=https:\\\\evilsite.com\u0026gt;notsean\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, it allows it through and we get this result. The use of ``\\`` is important since ``/`` is filtered.\n\n![gitlab-href.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/460224/388533/gitlab-href.png)\n\nIf a user is to click onto my name to visit my profile, they will actually be redirected to my site instead. To see it in action, visit ``https://gitlab.com/snippets/1788795`` and check out my comment from my account @notsean, hover over my profile and you'll see it redirects to evilsite.com\n\nWe can then be a bit more clever and add an image icon, add the \"title\" attribute, and we can build a perfect phisher to either harvest their credentials, OR redirect to a GitLab Oauth application and gain access via that (users are more likely to just click ALLOW, especially if they think they will get some VIP upgrade.. :D)\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)\n\n  1. Visit your GitLab account settings and set your name to ``\u0026lt;a href=http:\\\\evilsite.com\u0026gt;notsean \u0026lt;img src=\"https:\\\\www.bugbountynotes.com\\assets\\img\\vip.png\" title=\"VIP User\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;``  - Replace notsean with your username to look real.\n  2. Go comment on a snippet and people will see a 'VIP' badge next to your name, hover over it will show 'VIP User', and clicking it will redirect to our site. The perfect scenario for an attacker! :)\n\n![gitlab-bugg.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/460224/388543/gitlab-bugg.png)\n\n## Impact\n\nAdd custom HTML to our name and trick user into handing over their credentials or giving us access to their gitlab account via a rogue application designed to look like it will get them a \"VIP\" upgrade (this is jsut an example)\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [gitlab-bugg.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/460224/388543/gitlab-bugg.png)\n* [gitlab-href.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/460224/388533/gitlab-href.png)\n\n---\n\n## Testing Activity \n@fjsanpedro \n* Test that the user name is rendering the html name but as text and not as html\n\n## Security Testing Activity\n@vij \n* Test that names are rendered safely\n\n\n## MR Breakdown\n@fjsanpedro \n* In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/views/shared/notes/_note.html.haml#L35 we call the method `sanitize` to clean the user name. Nevertheless, that method ends up calling `html_safe`. Therefore, if the `a` attribute is allowed, the user name will be rendered as html.\n\nWe can easily fix by replacing the method `sanitize` with `simple_sanitize`. Nevertheless, this method removes all html tags from the name. To be compliant with other parts of the platform, we shouldn't do this. In other features, we just render the user name without removing any data, just showing it as text instead of as HTML.\n\n* The fix will pass by removing the call to `sanitize` in that line, and just show the user name directly as text.\n\n@vij \n* The rendering of the user's name can be modified to not call html_safe, which will fix the rendering of any existing malicious user names","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-13T00:04:51.196Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T21:30:24.626Z","closed_at":"2020-06-30T07:31:14.805Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay

Security dashboard as well as pipeline security report is not visible for guests\n\nHowever, for public project this isn't the case. The security dashboard is not accessible but pipeline security report is visible to everyone which i believe is the same information? So this should not be visible for everyone for public projects too\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. As any user try to access security dashboard `/security/dashboard` of public project and you will get access denied `403`\n\n2. Now go to any successful pipeline of default branch and click on security tab `/pipelines/\u0026lt;PipelineId\u0026gt;/security` and all the information is displayed!\n\n\nRegards,\nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nSecurity report is visible for public projects!\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen a public project has `Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e Public Pipeline` unchecked, `/pipelines/:id/security` is still accessible to any user.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1) In a public project, set `Settings \u003e General \u003e Project Visibility \u003e Pipelines` to `Everyone with access`. \n2) In the same project, set `Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e Public Pipelines` as unchecked.\n3) Navigate to `/pipelines/:pipeline_id/security`.\n\nNote: pipelines can be made public/private in two different settings. You should follow the steps above to isolate the behavior for the setting with the bug.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe pipeline security report is visible.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe pipeline security report should respond with 404. This should match the behavior from when the pipelines visibility setting is controlled by `Settings \u003e General \u003e Project Visibility`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n[Setting Screenshots](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8800#note_215046889)\n\n### Resolution\n\nFix bug and [update documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8800#note_212918295)\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-10T19:10:42.234Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T09:52:18.478Z","closed_at":"2019-10-11T17:47:26.226Z","closed_by":{"id":4543806,"username":"pulkitsharma","name":"Pulkit Sharma","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/27a50531bf4fd501b5f0a9b2765a661a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pulkitsharma"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","HackerOne","backend","backend-weight::1","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","priority::3","security","security dashboard","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":731039,"iid":38,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/10/22/gitlab-12-4-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:41:53.212Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:43.889Z","due_date":"2019-10-17","start_date":"2019-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[{"id":4415595,"username":"pburkegitlab","name":"Paula Burke","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5fa5bc4ce2a4fb892fb3ef3454779045?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburkegitlab"},{"id":4543806,"username":"pulkitsharma","name":"Pulkit Sharma","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/27a50531bf4fd501b5f0a9b2765a661a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pulkitsharma"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4415595,"username":"pburkegitlab","name":"Paula Burke","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5fa5bc4ce2a4fb892fb3ef3454779045?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburkegitlab"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-02-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8800","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8800","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8800/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8800/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#8800","relative":"#8800","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#8800"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":16550785,"iid":8798,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Implement selective sync support for the various FDW queries","description":"Follow up after ~\"product discovery\" in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4645:\n\nImplement selective sync support for the various FDW queries in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/tree/master/ee/app/finders/geo\n\n\n* [ ] 1.

As a `Owner` of a private group , enable member lock at `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u0026lt;group\u0026gt;/-/edit#js-permissions-settings`\n\n2. Login as `Maintainer` and go into project within the group. You will see that you dont have option to add project members at `https://gitlab.com/\u0026lt;GroupWithMemberLock\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;ProjectName\u0026gt;/project_members`\n\n3. Now just visit direct url `https://gitlab.com/\u0026lt;GroupWithMemberLock\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;ProjectName\u0026gt;/project_members/import`\n\n4. Import the project members from other project and it will be successfully added to the current project which should not have been possible otherwise!\n\n\nRegards,\nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\n`Maintainer` can add/import project members despite member lock to a group\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n*

Destination for Geo based on Customer Feedback","description":"\u003ch3\u003eBackground\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nThere have been a few recent (and less recent) issues about the long term goal for Geo. \n\n* #8353 - Mid/long term direction for Geo using federation (This issue contains a number of other issues talking about technical goals for Geo).\n* #8411 - Secondary first MR's\n\nIt is important for us to consider what our long term goal is so that we make good short term decisions, and to do this we need to spend time researching our options. \n\n\u003ch3\u003eCustomer Centric Research\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nEach of the previous issues focuses on the technical ability of the feature, and what that affords the customer. For this issue I would like us to think about this the other way around. What do our customers want, and how will we build that. \n\n**Selective Sync of Projects** : some customers with many projects want the ability to be able to sync only certain projects to certain nodes. They have legal requirements that data for certain projects is not physically located outside of the USA. Yet they still need to have a Geo node closer to their users. \n\n**Writable Nodes** : customers want to be able to write to the nodes to reduce latency even further. \n\n**Transparent Setup** : customers want to be able to congifure their client the same way globally and let their operations teams orchestrate the nodes transparently to the users. \n\nThese are the first few that come to mind, I will add others as I find them. (And I'll find the issue links).\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOutcome for this issue\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nResearch like this has the potential to be long running. This issue is to set up the research project and create issues for the various avenues of enquiry.\n\nThe outcome for this issue is to create a set of issues that describe the research required for each topic. This issue is about breadth, and the set of issues that needs to be created is about depth. If possible, each issue should take no longer than one milestone to research.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-05T14:17:50.440Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T10:47:38.271Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T14:18:48.804Z","closed_by":{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel Nienaber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2722370/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rnienaber"},"labels":["Category:Disaster Recovery","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Geo Next Gen","devops::systems","group::geo","missed-deliverable","missed:11.8","product discovery [DEPRECATED]"],"milestone":{"id":523180,"iid":18,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/03/22/gitlab-11-9-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-09T14:56:19.024Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T19:56:35.917Z","due_date":"2019-03-22","start_date":"2019-02-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/18"},"assignees":[{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel Nienaber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2722370/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rnienaber"}],"author":{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel Nienaber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2722370/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rnienaber"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel Nienaber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2722370/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rnienaber"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8729","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8729","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8729/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/8729/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#8729","relative":"#8729","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#8729"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24685825,"iid":25607,"project_id":278964,"title":"Extended popover for issue links","description":"### Overview\n\nWe are working on a gitlab-ce~3592632 in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/50913. This issue serves as implementation issue of the final design. \n\n### Problem to solve\nWhen hovering over an issue link, we currently display the issue name in the tooltip. There is an opportunity to enhance this via additional information of this issue to get more context without having to open the actual link.\n\n### Proposal\n\nLet's enhance the tooltip by using a [popover](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components/popover/) and display this additional information when hovering over issue links.\n\n* Title\n* State\n* Creation date\n* Milestone\n* Weight\n* Author\n* Assignees\n* Confidential?\n\n### Solution\n\nThe work involved here is just the Barebones design below, which will be the first MVC. Fully specced out work will be done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364049.\n\n| Fully specced out + long title | Barebones | Skeleton |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| ![image](/uploads/c4b6325182e4eef223078220c54e43a9/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/4b60a02a2351e8bce8b34553fd82f28b/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/b77d1b60840d111ecba2a2bbe8200e3e/image.png) |\n\n#### Header\n\n![image](/uploads/be04760a9852948bbee49d50aafd8c60/image.png)\n\nI don't want to reinvent a pattern that is already in use and a convention at gitlab. When on an issue page, the status badge, the confidential icon and age are all in one line at the top. I wanted to reuse this pattern. It's what users are used to already.\n\n#### Milestone, weight, due date\n\n![image](/uploads/98fbcc4ade286a1fc35693ac99099070/image.png)\n\nThis is something that I noticed in the board cards and I think it works really well. Again, let's reuse what is already a convention at GitLab.\n\n#### Assignees\n\n![image](/uploads/c625c6da5bc09f9f4e82c5e0a7f8dc83/image.png)\n\nAt first, I wanted to have the assignees in the same line as milestone etc. Then I remembered that in board cards the assignees are in the bottom right corner, stacked up if more than one. It makes total sense to reuse this here. We want to establish a design language that users will understand by simply using the interface. Re-using patterns like these and creating conventions is the best approach to do this. \n\n### Vision\n\nThis is all good, but we can make it better. What if we tell the user if they interacted with the issue in question? Let's say they took part in the discussion, we could show that. \n\n![image](/uploads/bfaf6bc4c6e75927c0a8fd21bf785779/image.png)\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n(If no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Popover renders when hovering over an issue reference and loads up-to-date information\n- [ ] Popovers work when logged out.\n- [ ] Only users with permission to view the referenced issue can trigger/view the popover","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-05T12:59:53.878Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T05:03:34.236Z","closed_at":"2022-06-03T10:09:06.788Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich

Since CSS is only applied when the elemnents exist, I'd say it's safe to keep the current structure we have.\n- The frontend team is working on moving CSS from sprockets to webpack, which eventually will allow us to do code splitting and only load the CSS we need per page.\n\n\n## JavaScript\n### Vue Files\nVue files are composed for a `script` tag, which is plain JS and a `template` tag.\n\nWe will create a [global](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html#Global-Mixin) `mixin` with a function called `renderIfEE`.\n\n#### `script` tag\n* **For child components only imported in EE**\n  - We will use [`async components`](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components) to import components that should be imported for EE code only. \n\n  ##### Example:\n  ```javascript\n    components: {\n      'ee-component': () =\u003e this.renderIfEE \u0026\u0026 import('./ee-component.vue')\n    }\n  ```\n\n* **For JS code that is EE only, like props, computed properties, methods, etc, we will keep the current approach**\n\n  - Since we [can't async load a mixin](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/418#issuecomment-254032223) we will use the [`ee_else_ce`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ee_features.html#javascript-code-in-assetsjavascripts) alias we already have for webpack.\n  - This means all the EE specific props, computed properties, methods, etc that are EE only should be in a mixin in the `ee/` folder and we need to create a CE counterpart of the mixin\n\n  ##### Example:\n  ```javascript\n  import mixin from 'ee_else_ce/path/mixin';\n\n  {\n    mixins: [mixin]\n  }\n  ```\n- Computed Properties/methods and getters only used in the child import still need a counterpart in CE\n- For store modules, we will need a CE counterpart too.\n\n#### `template` tag\n* **EE Child components**\n  - Since we are using the async loading to check which component to load, we'd still use the component's name\n  ##### Example:\n  ```vue\n  \u003cscript\u003e\n  {\n    components: {\n      'ee-component': () =\u003e this.renderIfEE ? import('./ee-component.vue') : import('vue_shared/compoments/empty_ce_vue_component.vue')\n    }\n  }\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cee-component\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/template\u003e\n  ```\n\n* **EE extra HTML**\n  - For the templates that have extra HTML in EE we will use the `renderIfEE` mixin with the `v-if` directive.\n  - You can either use the `template` tag as a wrapper or directly in the element, if there is only one element to be rendered in EE:\n  ```html\n    \u003ctemplate v-if=\"renderIfEE\"\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eSeveral\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003enon wrapper\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eelements\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003ethat are rendered\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003ein EE only\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/template\u003e\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n    \u003cul v-if=\"renderIfEE\"\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eOne wrapped\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eelement\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ethat is rendered\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ein EE only\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/template\u003e\n  ```\n\n### Non Vue Files\nFor regular JS files, the approach is similar.\n\n1. We will keep using the [`ee_else_ce`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ee_features.html#javascript-code-in-assetsjavascripts) helper, this means that EE only code should be inside the `ee/` folder.\n  1. An EE file should be created with the EE only code, and it should extend the CE counterpart.\n1. We will create an helper function `renderIfEE` in our utils files. For code inside functions that can't be extended, we will use an `if` statement.\n  ##### example:\n  ```javascript\n  import renderIfEE from '~/lib/utils/common_utils'\n  if (renderIfEE) {\n    $('.js-import-git-toggle-button').on('click', () =\u003e {\n      const $projectMirror = $('#project_mirror');\n\n      $projectMirror.attr('disabled', !$projectMirror.attr('disabled'));\n    });\n  }\n  ``` \n\n\n## Differences\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eapp/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/todo_toggle/todo.vue\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/home/yorickpeterse/Projects/gitlab/gdk-ce/gitlab/app/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/todo_toggle/todo.vue b/home/yorickpeterse/Projects/gitlab/gdk-ee/gitlab/app/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/todo_toggle/todo.vue\nindex 706e6ca19c3..57125c78cf6 100644\n--- a/home/yorickpeterse/Projects/gitlab/gdk-ce/gitlab/app/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/todo_toggle/todo.vue\n+++ b/home/yorickpeterse/Projects/gitlab/gdk-ee/gitlab/app/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/todo_toggle/todo.vue\n@@ -50,6 +50,9 @@ export default {\n     buttonLabel() {\n       return this.isTodo ?
