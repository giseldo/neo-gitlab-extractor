Vulnerabilities are tracked across scans, so that users can understand what vulnerabilities they're fixing and introducing with new merge requests.\n\nAt the time of writing, the information about a vulnerability is saved to the database when the vulnerability is first detected. Subsequent scans producing the same vulnerability recognize the vulnerability is already present in the database, and subsequently discard the duplicate vulnerability.\n\nThis leads to situations like the following:\n\n- A scan runs in a pipeline, and detects vulnerability `X`.\n- The scanner is updated to fix the suggested solution for resolving vulnerability `X`. \n- A new scan runs in a pipeline, and detects vulnerability `X` again.\n- The Security Dashboard shows old, incorrect suggested solution.\n\nThis problem affects fields that change value, such as the suggested solution in the example above. It also affects new fields. For example, DAST has recently added `evidence`, `request` and `response`. These fields will only be shown on new vulnerabilities on the Security Dashboard.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\n- If a vulnerability is found to be already present in the database when parsing/storing reports, we should update fields of the vulnerability to those from the latest scan\n- These updates should only take place on the `default` branch of the project\n- Vulnerability fields that related to identity should not be changed.\n  - ActiveRecord `id` should not change\n  - Relationships in the database should not change\n  - Conceptually, it should be the same vulnerability (e.g. `location_fingerprint` should not have changed)\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n[Gold/Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers)\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nThis will affect Secure products that production reports that are parsed.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. ~backend Prepare `Vulnerabilities::UpdateService` to be able to update vulnerability with new values (possible conflicts with #223812).\n1. ~backend Modify https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/services/security/store_report_service.rb#L86 to use `Vulnerabilities::UpdateService` to update Vulnerability when `vulnerability_finding` has `vulnerability_id` assigned to it.\n  1. ~backend Make sure that `severity` and `confidence` are not updated when they are overridden (look for `severity_overridden` and `confidence_overriden` properties)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-20T05:45:16.206Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T16:27:15.069Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T23:19:58.696Z","closed_by":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","backend","customer","devops::secure","group::threat insights","security dashboard","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"}],"author":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214987","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214987","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214987/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214987/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214987","relative":"#214987","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214987"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3308,"epic":{"id":53573,"iid":3308,"title":"Improved Visibility and Efficiency","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3308","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33497753,"iid":214985,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update License Compliance Docs -

This will eventually allow us to have unique URLs (just like MRs and Issues) and more sharing of designs.\n\n### About\n\nWe would like designs to have `iid`s scoped to the `Project` (like how issues and MRs do).\n\nThis will allow us to link to designs using their `iid` in Gitlab-flavored markdown, and also to display the designs at a URI like `\u003cproject-full-path\u003e/-/designs/\u003cdesign-iid\u003e`.\n\n### Engineering MR Breakdown\n\n@lulalala:\nWould it be preferable to reserve enough iid numbers for existing designs, so after design iids order still represent chronological order?\n\n* 1 MR (add table and ensure iids for new designs)\n* 1 MR (background migration for old designs)\n\n@.Luke:\nThe requirements for a data migration to backfill data can be complex (previous experience)\n* iid database migration\n* add `AtomicInternalId` to `Design` (using backfill: true)\n* data migration to backfill iids\n* remove backfill: true from `has_internal_id` (via `AtomicInternalId`)\n\n@toupeira:\nWe have existing functionality to handle the backfilling for us, and also a similar MR to use as a basis.\n\n* 1 MR to introduce IIDs\n* 1 MR to add a data migration to backfill existing designs\n* 1 MR (at least 1 minor release later) to disable backfilling\n\n@alexkalderimis:\n\nThis needs to go out in two, possibly three parts: one for the migration and new iid allocation, a background migration to backfill the old designs, and then maybe a third for updates to scopes/finders\n\n* migration/data model\n* backfilling\n* service level operations\n\n\n### Testing Activity\n\n@toupeira:\n* Reuse existing shared examples.\n* Test the data migration.\n\n@.Luke:\n* model specs\n* data migration specs\n\n@alexkalderimis:\n* Need to test that we can assign and search for designs by iids","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-20T03:30:05.803Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T15:42:34.412Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T17:03:19.840Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","Deliverable","backend","devops::plan","direction","group::product planning","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214978","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214978","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214978/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214978/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214978","relative":"#214978","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214978"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3102,"epic":{"id":43301,"iid":3102,"title":"Clicking and viewing a Design from GitLab Flavored Markdown shortlinks (^ design-iid)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3102","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33475842,"iid":214921,"project_id":278964,"title":"Don't auto-clear Project URL field when tabbing into it (when creating new projects)","description":"A small UX tweak...

With the introduction of credential management capabilities like [optional SSH key expiration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36243) and [PAT expiration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/17344) (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/118893 for gitlab.com), additional functionality is required to enable `administrators` and `group owners` to facilitate the rotation of credentials once they're expired.\n\nGitLab would like to strike a balance between necessary policy definition and enforcement that compliance-minded organizations require and maintaining a great developer experience. Abrupt credential revocation is disruptive and frustrating, but an organization unable to rotate credentials for their users faces an increased risk of a credential's compromise.\n\nThere's no way to revoke SSH or PAT credentials on behalf of `users` for `administrators` and `group owners`, who need to enforce this action.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### Solution\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWe introduced a [credential inventory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36742) in 12.6 and extended it to group-managed accounts for GitLab.com in 12.8 to help customers gain visibility into all of the PAT and SSH credentials that existed within their self-managed instance and groups. This inventory provided necessary insight into the access users had for a particular instance or group, but it does not provide other necessary capabilities such as forcing a credential rotation (in the event of a known compromise).\n\nCurrently, when an SSH or PAT expires the specific user is notified of the expiration, but `administrators` and `group owners` are completely unaware. There's no way for `administrators` and `group owners` to see, in aggregate, when credentials have expired to enable them to engage with the user to rotate that credential, let alone force a rotation with a `revoke` mechanism.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nOn both the PAT tab and SSH tab of the [credential inventory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36742):\n\n1. Add an \"Expired\" column that shows the expiration date. The color applied to the expiration date should change as per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214723#note_361604419. The hover tooltip should say \"This credential has expired.\"\n\n| PAT tab | SSH tab |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![PATs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/4dbc7762e2fd8a51d9c5130f901ee6b2/PATs.png) | ![SSHs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/3f17e948387fdff8def75ad40af1c6c2/SSHs.png) |\n\n\n**SSH Workflow**\n1. A `User` sets their [optional expiration date](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#adding-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account) of `30 days` for their SSH key within GitLab\n2. The SSH key reaches the expiration date `30 days` from the initial setting date **or** `existing` SSH keys that are older than `30 days` exist\n\n**PAT Workflow**\n1. An `administrator` or `group owner` defines a PAT expiration date ([self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/3649); [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/118893)) of `30 days` that applies to their `users`\n2. `Existing` credentials older than `30 days` and any credentials reach the `30 days` expiration date\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nOnly `administrators` and `group owners` would see this specific signal since they are the only users who can view the credential inventory.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

This parameter is available for multipart *and* body uploads.\n\nCurrently, on the rails side, we have the following:\n* Multipart uploads: in `multipart.rb`, we read the workhorse parameters in the Rack parameter and build a `UploadedFile` with `UploadedFile.from_params`.\n* Body uploads: there is no middleware at all. Each endpoint has to use `UploadedFile.from_params` and read the Rails `params`.\n\nThis is not ideal for several reasons:\n* Multipart uploads: rake `params` should not be trusted.\n* Body uploads: rails `params` should not be trusted *and* it's a developer burden to use `UploadedFile.from_params`.\n\n## Improvements\n\nCreate a middleware that replaces `Gitlab::Middleware::Multipart` and does what `Gitlab::Middleware::Multipart` is doing currently *but*:\n* Read the uploaded file params from a JWT param set by workhorse.\n* From these, build an `UploadedFile` and set it on the query params.\n* Support multipart *and* body uploads.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis issue will replace an existing feature that is used on *all* file uploads.\n\nI'm considering a medium risk so we definitely need a safety net here. Here is the plan:\n* Have both middleware mounted so the both process upload requests.\n* Use a **feature flag** to decide which will actually process the upload request and which one will just do a no op.\n\n## Involved components\n\n* A new rails middleware\n* `Gitlab::Middleware::Multipart`\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n* This issue will unlock a cleanup:\n  * Business code will not need to use `UploadedFile.from_params`. It's already done by the middleware and thus, those parts can read the `UploadedFile` that is present in the rails `params` directly.\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n:warning: For the specs, use a feature spec with an inline workhorse.\n\nCases for the spec:\n* Nuget upload (multipart)\n* Maven upload (body)\n* Graphql upload / add design to an issue (multipart)\n* CI artifacts upload (multipart with 2 files)\n* User avatar upload (multipart with a nested file, eg. parameter name is something like `foo[bar]`)\n* Project Import (multipart where the API is already using the `UploadedFile` from the middleware)\n* Group import (multipart upload)\n* git LFS Upload (body)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-17T11:45:06.463Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T19:28:30.102Z","closed_at":"2021-01-05T19:28:30.043Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Architecture decision","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","feature flag","package:active","security","type::feature","workflow::production","workhorse"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214785","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214785","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214785/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214785/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214785","relative":"#214785","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214785"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33422657,"iid":214783,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group Level Wiki: Test the feature before going live","description":"# Test Plan\n\n\u003c!-- This issue outlines testing activities related to a particular issue or epic.\n\n[Here is an example test plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/50353)\n\nThis and other comments should be removed as you write the plan --\u003e\n\n## Introduction\n\n\u003c!-- Briefly outline what is being tested\n\nMention the issue(s) this test plan is related to --\u003e\n\nTest the new wiki functionality on the group-level: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2214\n\n## Scope\n\n\u003c!-- State any limits on aspects of the feature being tested\nOutline the types of data to be included\nOutline the types of tests to be performed (functional, security, performance,\ndatabase, automated, etc) --\u003e\n\nThis covers all features implemented in [MVC 1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2214).\n\nThis includes all basic wiki functionality through the web UI, but excludes Git repository access and some other features that will be added in [MVC 2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2782).\n\nThe feature is behind a group-level feature flag `:group_wiki`.\n\n## ACC Matrix\n\n\u003c!-- Use the matrix below as a template to identify the Attributes, Components, and\nCapabilities relevant to the scope of this test plan.

`ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` variable at scan time and pass into pip's `PIP_CERT` environment variable during `pip` and `pipenv` build phases.\n\nUsing this variable and `PIP_INDEX_URL`, users will be able to use private repos and custom ca certificates chains without modifying the template or making scan-time additions to the analyzer.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] pass the certificate specified in `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` to `pip install` and `pipenv install` as `PIP_CERT` (or `PIP_CLIENT_CERT`?)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] update [offline

`python-pipenv` test projects with a custom pypi registry\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers will be able to pass in a custom pypi repo with a self-signed certificate and have the analyzer scan without certificate errors.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n### Links / references\n\nRelated:

Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nIn 12.6 we introduced a [PAT expiration setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/3649) that automatically revokes tokens when the expiration date has been met or exceeded. This creates friction for users and doesn't provide flexibility in building smoother user experiences around credential rotation.\n\nCurrently, the programmatic enforcement of this expiration setting is unchangeable and there's no way to allow for \"soft\" enforcement to avoid disruption for users.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nProvide a checkbox that allows the `administrator` or `owner` to specify \"optional enforcement\" of PAT expiration.\n\nIf `enabled`, the behavior remains unchanged and PATs are automatically revoked when the date is met or exceeded.\n\nIf `disabled`, GitLab will continue to notify the user via email, CLI, and/or in-app messaging about the expired credential, but will not automatically invalidate it.\n\n![clip-2020-06-01](/uploads/40c3414388bf572a780cea65500fe645/clip-2020-06-01.png)\n\nIf a user's token is 7-days from expiring, we should display an in-app message to the user that says:\n\n\u003e One or more of your personal access tokens will expire soon. [Update Now](#)\n\nIf a user's token has expired, we should display:\n\n\u003e One or more of your personal access tokens has expired. [Update Now](#)\n\nThis message should probably persist until they dismiss it or take action.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nOnly `administrators` (for self-managed) and `Group Owners` (for GitLab.com) can modify this setting.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Web IDE state management of files and file changes","description":"## Description\n\nCurrently in the Web IDE, there's some tight coupling, duplication of state, sharing of objects between the various file collections in the Web IDE store.\n\n- `state.entries`\n- `state.tree`\n- `state.changedFiles`\n- `state.stagedFiles`\n\nThis hurts our maintainability, but also creates [some hard to catch regressions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213238) and hacks when resolving file changes (because things are imperatively added/removed to the staged or changed bucket as opposed to reactively revaluated based on some virtual HEAD).\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's redesign how our Web IDE state tree for files and file changes... This will probably also solve https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2433\n\nThis issue should result in:\n\n- An end-goal for how state should be organized and managed.\n  - What does the ideal state tree look like?\n  - After decoupling, are there any other modules/components this introduces?\n  - What modules/components will be no longer relevant?\n- An iteration plan for how to migrate the current codebase\n- A rough POC\n- A review from other FE maintainers/contributiors.\n\n## Objectives\n\n* Reduce duplication of file object across state. The `trees`, `entries`, `stagedFiles`, `openFiles`, etc., all share references to the same file objects. This creates some tight coupling situations (i.e. I can read from the property `changed` but I'm not allowed to change it, only X_MUTATION can change it).\n* Implement staged / changed as a result of **watching** file changes (like how Git works), instead of having each file change know how to update the staged / changed files.\n* Reduce number of props saved for each file object.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-16T19:56:04.373Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T19:14:01.968Z","closed_at":"2020-06-15T18:09:28.886Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Deliverable","Discovery","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","maintenance::refactor","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"}],"author":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216180","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216180","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216180/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/216180/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#216180","relative":"#216180","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#216180"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33397578,"iid":214713,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display iterations list","description":"After https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214846 is ready, we need to add the actual GraphQL API and views to be able to add sprints\n\nThis includes ONLY group views.

We can avoid committing to the repository when the `file_name` and `content` attributes aren't updated.\n\nAt first, I thought that we could use `snippet.previous_changes` to check whether those attributes are different but, since we don't since back from a commit action to the snippet record in the db we cannot rely on this because there can be scenarios where the commit to the repo doesn't happen. For example:\n- User A creates a project snippet with content `foo`\n- User B updates the snippet through git and set the content to `bar` (Value in the database still `foo`)\n- User A edits the snippet and sets again the content to `foo`. Since the current value and the existing one in the database are the same, the commit action won't happen and the file in the repo will still have the content `bar`.\n\nThis becomes even more difficult when we don't rely at all from the attributes `file_name` and `content`. And we cannot bring the data from Gitaly in order to compare it to the params passed to the service, because that is not performant.\n\nI think the answer if we want to avoid some extra commit actions in the future would be to have different `Save` actions. One `Save` action will save those attributes in the database and the other one will save the file's data.\n\n/cc @dsatcher","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-16T16:18:20.410Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T19:27:49.011Z","closed_at":"2020-04-17T19:27:48.941Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","backend","devops::create","group::editor","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214692","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214692","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214692/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214692/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214692","relative":"#214692","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214692"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33378975,"iid":214685,"project_id":278964,"title":"Increase the page size exponentially for the repository file tree batch requests","description":"\u003c!-- The first three sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\" and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

It targets a path on one of two copies of a sanitised version of out `gitlab-foss` project that has a high number of files ([`app/assets/images/emoji`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/app/assets/images/emoji) - 1794 files). The equivalent API test is shown for context but it's performing within expectations as it's paginating.\n\nOf note for this particular endpoint is that it dynamically loads in more logs as the user scrolls the page if there's many files. When this occurs the performance hit happens to the user essentially on each page scroll, degrading the experience further (you can see this live in effect here - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/app/assets/images/emoji).\n\nAs shown above the `logs_tree` action is performing badly here with a TTFB P90 of around 2.7s. As per our [performance targets](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity) this issue falls into the ~s2 tier.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-16T14:34:06.137Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T17:32:49.324Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T05:26:34.618Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor

`\"0\"` (`String`) if `freq == 0`, or `freq` (`Fixnum`).\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Since we are stringfying in the presentation layer, should we just return `Fixnum` here?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e

\u003e\n    \u003e  We need to display a `-` when values are 0, for deploy, commit and issue counts, but not for deployment frequency.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e  e.g. when there has been 1 deployment in 30 days, the deploy count is 1, but the deployment frequency is 0.03, which is rounded off to 0.0 (it is requirement to show frequency only upto 1 decimal point). Now, if we change all zero values to `-`, the deployment frequency would be `-`, even though there has been a deployment. So it is best to show the rounded off value.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e  In the FE it is much harder to treat values coming from each of the counts differently, so we're implementing this in the BE.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e  Even in the BE, we need the check in at least 2 places:\n    \u003e\n    \u003e  1 - if there were no deploys, the deploy frequency is 0 (number), which will be displayed as `-` (string)\n    \u003e\n    \u003e  2 - if there were deploys but the deploy frequency is 0.0, we want to display `0.0` (string)\n    \u003e\n    \u003e  This is why it is not possible to _always_ return a Fixnum from here.\n\n    @splattael wrote:\n\n    \u003e I see, it's tricky indeed.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e I don't like how the presenter logic is scattered across two files: entity and summary helper.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e Maybe, we could introduce two presenter objects (say, `NoDeploys`, `Frequency`)\n    \u003e\n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e       def frequency(count, from, to)\n    \u003e         (count / days(from, to)).round(1)\n    \u003e         return NoDeploys.new if count.zero?\n    \u003e\n    \u003e         freq = (count / days(from, to)).round(1)\n    \u003e         Frequency.new(freq)\n    \u003e       end\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e\n    \u003e The presenters:\n    \u003e\n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e       class NoDeploys\n    \u003e         def to_s\n    \u003e           '-'\n    \u003e         end\n    \u003e       end\n    \u003e\n    \u003e       Frequency = Struct.new(:value) do\n    \u003e         def to_s\n    \u003e           value.zero? ?

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\nCurrently when using [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso) the [default `Role` of a newly created user is `Guest`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/#role). The requires users/administrators to have a second process to add users to projects and groups at their desired access level. Many customers have a secondary homegrown process that goes back and changes the role for all users.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) --\u003e\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n### Further details\nGiving administration and security teams the ability to use their already centralized user and application management systems (i.e. Okta, ADFS, etc.) to ensure an appropriate level of access would cut down on the administration time required to onboard new users into GitLab.\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\nAllow for the default role to be changed from `Guest` to any other option for the top-level group. This allows organizatons to bring everyone in at a more trusted level (i.e. `Developer`) or lower level (i.e. [No Access](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220203)). If a more permissive role is granted explicitly then this setting would no longer apply (ie a user would not be able to be \"downgraded\" by SSO). This setting should apply to users created via SCIM and users that join a group by following an SSO link.\n\nThis would be a small iteration and further enhanced by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118 in the future.\n\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\nThis would use existing permissions required to add/update/delete existing users.\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n**What risks does this change pose to our availability?**\n\nThis is a low risk feature that should not affect GitLab.com availability. \n\n**What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?**\n\nWe have existing coverage for [Group SAML SSO at e2e level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/0e418163c96c98e96e73a3a1683fe9849ce687e9/qa/qa/specs/features/ee/browser_ui/1_manage/group/group_saml_non_enforced_sso_spec.rb) that should be updated to add a test that ensures the users are assigned the selected roles.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\nThis would be for larger organizations that use SSO. Auditing and Reporting of access levels would be ideal for a compliance team. \n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n/cc @dblessing","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-15T17:49:00.448Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T04:11:58.972Z","closed_at":"2020-08-12T04:11:58.904Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","group::authentication and authorization","quad-planning::complete-action","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":3685676,"username":"bdowney","name":"Brad Downey","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3685676/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdowney"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":10,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214523","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214523","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214523/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/214523/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#214523","relative":"#214523","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#214523"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3191,"epic":{"id":47957,"iid":3191,"title":"Workspace Isolation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3191","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33334036,"iid":214511,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group deploy token -

apollo in the cleanup policy for tags form","description":"~\"frontend-weight::2\" \n\n### Problem to solve\nThe Cleanup policy for tags gives you a way to programmatically remove any unused image/tags from your GitLab Container Registry. However, the form is not yet leveraging the Graphql API created for this purpose. \n\nUsing the GraphQL API will allow us to: \n- Dynamic set of fields selected only if the client needs them.\n- Living API - we could deprecate \u0026 remove these fields if we absolutely had to\n- Instrumentation can give us metrics on use to inform deprecation decisions\n- Lazy evaluation built-in from the start\n\n\n### Intended users\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n- Improved performance and reliability of the Cleanup policy feature\n\n### Proposal\nAs a follow-up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196784, we will enable GraphQL and vue apollo in the cleanup policy for tags form. \n\nAs a part of this work we will:\n\n- remove (or heavily slim down) vuex from `app/assets/javascripts/registry/settings/`\n- Add vue-apollo to call graphql\n- write down the necessary queries and mutations\n- Adjust the tests\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no expected permissions changes\n\n### Documentation\n- There are no expected documentation changes\n\n### Links / references\n* Graphql:

all the logic.\n\n## Risks\n\nIf done incorrectly we can break existing behavior of standalone vulnerabilities which is scheduled to go live with %\"12.10\".
