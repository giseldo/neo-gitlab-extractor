Add \"setup a self-hosted runner\" to the pipeline zerostate page","description":"# Problem\nMany active and engaged namespaces create a self-hosted CI/CD pipeline runner in order to manage their own CI/CD workflow. There are many different reasons why a namespace would want to do this. One thing that we know is that namespaces that set up a hosted runner upgrade at a significantly higher rate than those that utilize shared runners. Additionally, we have run tests that show that making it easier to set up a self-hosted runner successfully drives upgrade, however previous tests that highlight hosted runners over shared runners have decreased the overall number of namespaces utilizing CI/CD pipelines.\n\n![image](/uploads/5d8f7837b07787d0b7fc5aba614a64dc/image.png)\n\n## Hypothesis\nBy highlighting self-hosted runners on the pipeline zero state page and making it easier for users to set up a self-hosted runner from that page, we will maintain the overall number of verify users and drive additional free to paid conversion from those that need a self-hosted runner\n\n## Details\n\nUpdate the current pipeline zero state page (below) to include a section that guides users who want to set up a self-hosted runner to our cloudformation templates that help them easily create those runners. This section should also guide users who want to learn more about hosted vs shared runners to a documentation page where they can learn more.\n\n![image](/uploads/d48751771a2e60e80306817c26115d3d/image.png)\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**When runners are available, provide users with this information:** \n\n**Runners are available to run your jobs now**\n\nGitLab Runner is an application that works with GitLab CI/CD to run jobs in a pipeline, and can be shared or self-hosted. There are [shared runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#shared-runners) available to run your jobs right now. Or, if you prefer you can install GitLab Runner (\u003c-- link to project settings\u003erunners) and register your own runners.\n\n**When there are no runners available, provide users with this information:**\n\n**No runners detected**\n\nA GitLab Runner is an application that works with GitLab CI/CD to run jobs in a pipeline.

types","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/13784, Gitlab delivered the capability to mask secret variables out from the logs to ensure secret AUTH data is not leaked to users and secrets/tokens are kept secret. aka \"Masked Variables\" feature.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#via-the-ui, specifically: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#masked-variables\n\nSince then, there have been a few (1 or 2?) iterations of missed requirements in terms of the limitations of the features for both \"disallowed characters\" and \"anti-length restrictions\".\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/60790\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/65938\n\nSince GitLab users can now define raw variables through [the UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217309) \u0026 [YAML configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353991),  the purpose of this issue is to assess if we can also remove the special char masking restriction when users define a raw variable. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nAs there have been further limitations identified, the purpose of this issue is to assess these special character limitations, remove them if possible, and document those that cannot be fixed (and why).\n\nAt the end of this, the goal is:\n- Allow special characters to masked if the variable is set to `raw` (expanded: false)\n\n### Testing\n\nSome characters MAY be dangerous to mask if they are special in the shell or in the backend code.\nCare must be taken to ensure masking is always safe, and no unsupported input chars can crash or corrupt.\n\n### Implementation Table\n\n| Group | Issues | Issue Link | Notes |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------

This is all good, but when viewing the file listing of a `job` in https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/browse all HTML files are presented as an `external link`, see image. These links do not point directly to the `pages` domain, but instead to https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/file/hej.html . Visiting this link returns a 303 redirect to the `pages` address.\n\nThe issue with this is that a malicious user now have an official gitlab.com link that will redirect to a page at gitlab.io where the user have full control of the content. That includes JS and further redirection with `window.location`. This can be abused in multiple ways to disguise the link to trick users into clicking it.\n\nExamples\n\n1. A normal link anywhere \"Look at this in Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/file/hej.html\"  \n1. A malicious upload in Markdown. Adding a link to `/uploads/anything` will render the links as a valid `atachement` in GFM. This markdown `[info.txt](/uploads/../GROUP/PROJECT/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/file/hej.html)` will render into an attachment link that will redirect a user to my site. This works in wikis as well.\n\n![gfm.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/04b74451-bc12-4fd7-8650-5ee1e3dd921d/gfm.png)\n\n1. If created in a `private` or `internal` project, any user visiting the link will be shown the \"Page not found\" which will contain a link \"Login to access GitLab\". This link will put the user at the official login page with the \"follow referer\" flag set. When the user then log in, the user will immediately be redirected to https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/file/hej.html and then to whatever the link points to. Which could be a phishing page mimicking the login page the user just visited and might be fooled to reenter credentials.\n\nThere are probably more places where a link like this could be used to mimic a regular gitlab.com URL.\n\nI took the CVSS score from the open redirect that was patched in the latest patch, but changed PR to Low as the user needs to create the file. Even though I think that this one is worse than the one in the patch. It is worth noting that the generated link shows no sign of being a redirection. A lot of times a redirect is generated like so `https://host.com?redirect=https://evil.com` which would give away that something is going on. These links just look like regular GitLab paths without a hint of where the user will end up.\n\n####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Log in with a user, let's call the user `user01`  \n2. Create a project from https://gitlab.com/projects/new lets call it `project01`  \n3. Create a file in the new project called hack.html containing\n\n```javascript  \n\u003cscript\u003ealert(document.domain); window.location = \"https://example.com\"\u003c/script\u003e  \n```\n\n4. Go to the CI/CD editor at https://gitlab.com/user01/project01/-/ci/editor and enter this config\n\n```yml  \ndata:  \n  script: echo hej  \n  artifacts:  \n    paths:  \n      - ./  \n    expire_in: 4 weeks  \n```\n\n5. This should also trigger the first pipeline run. Go to https://gitlab.com/user01/project01/-/jobs and find the latest job. Take a note of the Job ID.  \n6. Go to https://gitlab.com/user01/project01/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/browse  \n7. Copy the link from the \"hack.html\" file link.  \n8. Test to browse to the link in any window. You will first see a popup with the `pages` domain (this is so that you can see that we first land here), and when you click OK you will go to example.com\n\n####  What is the current bug behavior?  \nArtifact links point to a GitLab.com address which will redirect to a gitlab.io address\n\n####  What is the expected correct behavior?  \nThe link could point directly to the GitLab.io address\n\n####  Output of checks  \nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nOpen redirect that could be used to trick users to visit malicious sites. The links look (and are) official and contains no references to the malicious site\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [gfm.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/04b74451-bc12-4fd7-8650-5ee1e3dd921d/gfm.png)\n\n## Proposal \n\nJust show the contents of the file when the customer clicks on the artifact link. If I'm going to https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/jobs/JOBID/artifacts/file/hej.html, I expect to see the contents of `hej.html` - not to be redirected to where that page is being hosted.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-11T15:40:17.496Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T16:55:10.889Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T20:12:42.800Z","closed_by":{"id":4992072,"username":"dcouture","name":"Dominic

widgets\n  - They are not interacted with, and don’t appear to be useful even in a read-only state\n- The most commonly used widget is the Pipeline widget (used by both reviewers and authors)\n  - Some reviewers (maintainers) looked at the approval widget to see what else was needed\n  - Reviewers (maintainers) use the `Merge` widget to see if it’s mergeable\n- They reported so many false positives in the past that developers are conditioned to ignore them completely\n  - lack of trust\n- When developers _do_ want to find information in a widget, it can be tricky to actually locate the widget on the page\n  - Widget location depends on length of description\n- (Somewhat related) Some users (in recent SUS survey verbatims) have complained about `Merge` and `Approve` being too close together that they accidentally click one when they meant to click the other\n  - This only happens on lower tiers that don't have as many widgets enabled\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### 💡

request to another user without writing an accompanying comment\n  - Adding a comment adds a personable, kind, human touch to the transaction (emojis are very common here)\n  - It can improve overall communication on the team\n  - Helps enforce the GitLab collaboration value “People are not their work”\n- When an MR author is asking for a review, a comment has the following benefits:\n  - It allows the requested reviewer an easy and personable way to back out if they’re busy; they can simply respond in thread (they are doing you a favor)\n  - The author can call out specific parts of the MR to make the review easier (see also: self-review)\n  - If assigning to multiple reviewers, author can specify certain areas for each reviewer\n  - Reviewer can more easily understand what role they’re playing (author can say something like “Can you please do the maintainer review and merge if it looks good”\n- When a reviewer is handing it back to the author, the comment has the following benefits:\n  - Reviewer can thank the author first, adding an element of kindness no matter how the review went\n  - Reviewer can summarize the feedback to provide high-level info at a glance\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eConventional comments help structure a code review\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- [🕊 Dovetail

quick glance at what the comment is about\n  - they eliminate ambiguity as to whether the comment is truly blocking or not\n  - They help non-native speakers (of whatever the chosen language is) avoid potential misunderstandings\n  - Allows reviewers to praise authors with non-blocking comments (even though technically they are blocking in GitLab)\n    - Fosters collaboration and kindness\n  -

I would like to leave https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227233 as the future vision issue. I'm not sure if this is the right process, so please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n\n## Customer problem\nAs discovered in [problem validation](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/3OuiWLJsaXTMFV2aPXrmIq/insights/present), customers want a way to manage storage used by snapshots and pre-releases. In GitLab, when a customer is working on a snapshot, they will re-upload a package with the same name and version to the registry. This essentially adds more files to an existing package in the registry. The more you update a package, the more files it accumulates, the more storage it will take. \n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-02-11_at_19.38.16](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/319d1a943c93d9a647df70f74c2cba23/Screen_Shot_2022-02-11_at_19.38.16.png)\n\nFrom problem validation:\n\u003e One participant has majority Maven packages. Per sprint of 3 weeks work they work on a snapshot version; one snapshot can product 250 artifacts amounting to 13 gigs.\n\n## Design proposal :arrow_down_small: \n* Attached to this issue.\n* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OCEP1esclZnGKZ26fC0PjJ/Package-settings?node-id=264%3A110362)\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-11T06:48:44.582Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T12:56:14.319Z","closed_at":"2022-07-21T08:24:23.745Z","closed_by":{"id":11214192,"username":"rchanila","name":"Rahul Chanila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11214192/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchanila"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","GitLab Free","Package:P1","UX","auto updated","backend","devops::package","direction","feature::addition","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::package registry","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":11214192,"username":"rchanila","name":"Rahul Chanila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11214192/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchanila"}],"author":{"id":9608331,"username":"katiemacoy","name":"Katie Macoy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9608331/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/katiemacoy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11214192,"username":"rchanila","name":"Rahul Chanila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11214192/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchanila"},"user_notes_count":82,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352566","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352566","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352566/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352566/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352566","relative":"#352566","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352566"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5152,"epic":{"id":177448,"iid":5152,"title":"Package Registry cleanup policies MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5152","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102248376,"iid":352562,"project_id":278964,"title":"Bypass ongoing imports in the Guard worker","description":"## Proposal\n\nThis issue originates from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351337#note_837857367.\n\nThe [GuardWorker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79634) for the container registry phase 2 migration currently aborts all imports that have exceeded the `container_registry_import_max_step_duration`.\n\nIn these cases, we want to keep the container repositories in the `importing` or `pre_importing` `migration_state`s. \n\nWe should:\n\n1.

I'd like to thank @joe-snyder for the bias for action and the community contribution. It's great to see and we're excited to continue to collaborate on future issues!\n\n### Why Revert?\n\nThe Code Review group is currently engaged on a [very similar issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26781#proposal) related to uploads in which we debated the use of a setting. Ultimately, we believe that if organizations are setting projects to private, they have that expectation for all behavior of items that might reach users via notifications. Forcing organizations to find and then utilize a setting for this doesn't make sense when they've already implied this behavior by setting a project to private.\n\n### Can this be contributed without a setting?\n\nAt this time, we **do not** want to accept a contribution for similar functionality but without the setting. The reason for this is that we're in the middle of completing the other similar issue and want to [take community feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352294) on that prior to compounding that pattern. We're also concerned about the lost diffs in emails as they wouldn't be recoverable if we did revert the setting-less behavior.\n\n### What are the next steps?\n\n1. We're going to revert this change so that it does not make it in the packaged %14.8 release and is removed from GitLab.com.\n1.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nWhen enabling a review app, the documentation is not applicable to most review app users, and the code snippet isn't as helpful as it should be. We are replacing the instructions to be more consistent with the documentation and providing some example projects to reference while configuring your own review app.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nAs part of the [UX scorecard for Review apps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1630), I found that the `Enable Review app` button on the Environments page contains deprecated documentation to [add a cluster using cluster certificates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/add_remove_clusters.html). I was super confused if that step was even necessary. It was not in my case as I was generating a static site. I'm not sure if it is useful for other apps being deployed.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

This illustration doesn't support Dark Mode right now.\n\n![image](/uploads/243a98ca2a454977eff7323f9aef89f6/image.png)\n\nThis illustration is part of a [`@gitlab/svgs` npm package](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs).

That means it **can not** use CSS Custom Properties defined on the page that set colors for Dark Mode.\n\nThere are multiple ways to solve that:\n\n- Inline SVG. That'd increase served HTML size and prohibit us from caching this asset on this page. Also might impact some of the Core Web Vitals metrics, since it's not lazy-loaded anymore.\n- Change `img` to `svg` with `use` tag. That would mean that the illustration source should be served from the same origin as the page. SVGs do not work cross-origin unfortunately.\n- Use a hash to display a Dark Mode version of the asset (`merge_request.svg#dark_mode`). This implies the stylesheets are embedded within the SVG.\n- Use some JavaScript-based solution. Can be used if nothing else works out.\n- Some other path not listed here...","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-10T13:30:09.941Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T12:00:24.693Z","closed_at":"2022-04-20T15:51:48.011Z","closed_by":{"id":10539680,"username":"slashmanov","name":"Stanislav Lashmanov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10539680/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/slashmanov"},"labels":["Deliverable","SUS::Impacting","UI polish","UX","darkmode","devops::create","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:14.9","section::dev","severity::4","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":10539680,"username":"slashmanov","name":"Stanislav Lashmanov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10539680/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/slashmanov"}],"author":{"id":10539680,"username":"slashmanov","name":"Stanislav Lashmanov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10539680/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/slashmanov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":10539680,"username":"slashmanov","name":"Stanislav Lashmanov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10539680/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/slashmanov"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352500","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352500","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352500/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352500/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352500","relative":"#352500","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352500"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102206563,"iid":352495,"project_id":278964,"title":"Query related epics of an epic","description":"Related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/202431.\n\nSimilarly to [`Issue#related_issues`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/issue.rb#L440), we need to be able to query all epics related to a given epic.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n1. Check for the user's permissions to read them\nWe could implement a new method `Ability.epics_readable_by_user` that iterates every epic with [`readable_by?(user)`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/application_record.rb#L118). Similarly to [`Ability.issues_readable_by_user`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/issue.rb#L457).\n\nAs with most permission checks, the **performance impact** is a concern and should be evaluated.\n\nConsider comments in the [original discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351597#note_838361958) by `@jprovaznik`:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003e I think the most probable impact is there will be an N+1 issue when checking permission for each of the target epic, but given that this should be a small number (similar as for related issues), I think it's acceptable.\n\n\u003e If I try something like this:\n\n\u003e ```\n\u003e DeclarativePolicy.user_scope do\n\u003e   Epic.all.preload(:group).select { |epic| Ability.allowed?(user, \"read_epic\", epic) }\n\u003e end\n\u003e ```\n\n\u003e Then the only N+1 query I hit locally is:\n\n\u003e ```\n\u003e   SamlProvider Load (0.2ms)  SELECT \"saml_providers\".* FROM \"saml_providers\" WHERE \"saml_providers\".\"group_id\" = 28 \u003e LIMIT 1 /*application:console,db_config_name:main,line:/ee/app/models/ee/group.rb:202:in `block in root_saml_provider'*/\n\u003e ```\n\n\u003e But there is not much we can do about this one.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n2. Update the number of blocking epics of an epic when this number changes (see [`EE::Issue#update_blocking_issues_count!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/issue.rb#L215))\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-10T13:02:05.753Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T07:00:46.340Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T13:49:35.201Z","closed_by":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"labels":["Deliverable","Next Up","backend","devops::plan","direction","group::product planning","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"}],"author":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352495","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352495","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352495/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352495/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352495","relative":"#352495","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352495"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7546,"epic":{"id":439603,"iid":7546,"title":"Add support for epic to epic linking -

XSS through PlantUML proxy","description":"**[HackerOne report #1466686](https://hackerone.com/reports/1466686)** by `solov9ev` on 2022-02-01, assigned to @mhenriksen:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\nHi, Security Team!\n\nI discovered a **Gitlab XSS** vulnerability through PlantUML proxy\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n- First, install **PlantUML** (`sudo docker run -d --name plantuml -p 8080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:tomcat`)\n\n```  \nPlantUML Server Version 1202200  \n```\n\n- Next step install **Gitlab** (`sudo docker run --detach --hostname gitlab.example.com --publish 443:443 --publish 80:80 --publish 22:22 --name gitlab gitlab/gitlab-ee:latest`)\n\n```  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n Ruby:         ruby 2.7.5p203 (2021-11-24 revision f69aeb8314) [x86_64-linux]  \n GitLab:       14.7.0-ee (621e5984888) EE  \n GitLab Shell: 13.22.2  \n PostgreSQL:   12.7  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n```\n\nThe result is two running containers: `Gitlab`, `PlantUML`\n\n![1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/279d8088-fa74-41f5-bf0b-76621d306a04/1.png)\n\n- Add  values to the file `/etc/passwd` on your local machine:\n\n![2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4f7f4a71-c7f0-41fd-9bb3-7f82cd2e215b/2.png)\n\n- Let's check that everything works at the assigned addresses\n\nhttp://plantuml:8080/\n\n![3.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/47312ff7-305c-4b78-afcc-495a0e4c83dd/3.png)\n\nhttp://gitlab.example.com/\n\n![4.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/39c04048-ab80-4812-8d11-a0f8c64062fe/4.png)\n\n- Now you need to go into the Gitlab docker container and configure proxying in nginx according to the Gitlab documentation (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/integration/plantuml.html). In our case, the Gitlab container has id **5e0d07fae385**\n\nInstall a program for editing files in the docker container: `apt update \u0026\u0026 apt install nano`\n\n![5.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8c21c83f-fc2f-443d-832a-7228b987d4ba/5.png)\n\nNow you need to edit the Nginx configuration in Gitlab docker container: `nano /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`\n\n![6.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/e932ccd1-20d9-4753-97f0-7e19a803383d/6.png)\n\nI specified the ip address **172.17.0.1** because it is the docker address that I found out by running the `ifconfig` command on my local machine\n\n![7.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/2f7f9801-59cb-4f52-b3fb-1d7022726b65/7.png)\n\nAfter making changes to the file `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`, reconfigure the gitlab container: `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`\n\n![8.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/61ae7f0a-5b1c-46d6-a21b-cacff0a2a2fd/8.png)\n\n- Now you need to configure proxying to the **PlantUML**  in the settings of the Gitlab web system\n\n![9.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/2e31b638-c022-41c2-a714-42ec0d49e48e/9.png)\n\n- On the local machine (http://192.168.0.10:1337/xss_svg.svg), I placed the following SVG exploit. It must contain the **height** and **width**. Although this exploit can be placed anywhere\n\n```  \n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?\u003e  \n\u003c!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\"\u003e\n\n\u003csvg version=\"1.1\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e  \n   \u003cpolygon id=\"triangle\" points=\"0,0 0,50 50,0\" fill=\"#009900\" stroke=\"#004400\"/\u003e  \n   \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e  \n      alert(document.domain);  \n   \u003c/script\u003e  \n\u003c/svg\u003e  \n```\n\n- The user can then create a wiki page with the `AsciiDoc` type\n\n![10.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/32cd11df-0055-4083-b1cd-62fb10cebdf4/10.png)\n\n![11.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/799a10bd-3866-4e79-bef7-94766da90667/11.png)\n\n- After clicking on the SVG, due to proxying, gitlab displays svg in the **gitlab.example.com** domain\n\n![12.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7ceaefb2-f6de-4b5c-abb9-5ec716107aa2/12.png)\n\n- I proved that this SVG works in the github domain and provided the POC in this report #1457495\n\n####  Impact\n\nWith this vulnerability, an attacker can for example steal users cookies or redirect users on malicious website.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4f7f4a71-c7f0-41fd-9bb3-7f82cd2e215b/2.png)\n*

Update the [DockerRunner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/blob/7c9d53a28e0a6c2a1615a20754480ba5f65936e6/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/docker_runner.rb) to copy the `fixtures` parent directory to a temporary directory in the current project, such as `tmp/qa-#{RSpec.configuration.seed}`, before running a scan. In other words, if the fixtures directory is `qa/fixtures`, then we'll copy the entire `qa` directory to the `tmp` directory.\n\n   For example, here's the project layout _before_ running the image integration tests:\n\n   ```shell\n   .\n   └── gemnasium/\n       └── qa/\n           ├── scripts/\n           ├── expect/\n           └── fixtures/\n   ```\n\n   And here's the project layout _after_ running the image integration tests, with the `tmp` dir populated:\n\n   ```shell\n   .\n   └── gemnasium/\n       ├── qa/\n       │   ├── scripts\n       │   ├── expect\n       │   └── fixtures\n       └── tmp/\n           ├── qa-54805/\n           │   ├── scripts\n           │   ├── expect\n           │   └── fixtures\n           └── qa-57485/\n               ├── scripts\n               ├── expect\n               └── fixtures\n   ```\n\n   See [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/merge_requests/20) for a starting point.\n\n1. Add a constant value to the [DockerRunner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/blob/7c9d53a28e0a6c2a1615a20754480ba5f65936e6/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/docker_runner.rb) class, such as `MAX_TMP_SUBIDRS=10`, and delete old `tmp/qa-*` directories if the number of temporary subdirectories exceeds the `MAX_TMP_SUBIDRS` value.\n\n1.

The data collected depends on the instance's setting (Service Ping = On/Off) and whether the license indicates the customer is obligated to report [Operational Data](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/services-usage-data/#operational-data).\n\nIn this issue, I'd like to document specifics related to the timing of data collection.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nPlease research and document the answers to the following questions.\n\n1. [x] When does a SM instance generate and send the Service Ping payload? Is this on a static day of the week/time?\n     1. A: Service Pings are randomly distributed during the week ([reference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352457#note_838502718))\n1. [x] Can you explain the \"randomly distributed\" process in more detail? How does the instance know it's time to send the payload?\n     1. A: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352457#note_839848735\n1. [x] Can the instance admin overwrite the date/time of delivery of the Service Ping payload?\n     1. A: Theoretically yes, as they can change the code or config. But it's unlikely that someone does it. ([ref](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352457#note_839039786))\n1. [x] If an admin can change the delivery day/time and/or cadence, do we have any insights into the number of instances which have deviated from our established schedule?\n     1. A: No we would not have this insight. ([ref](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352457#note_839039786))\n1. [x] Is it possible to receive partial payloads? Like in the instance of a failure during collection.\n     1. A: We can't receive partial payloads, but we can receive payloads where some metrics are failing. However, we added measurements to not fail the whole service ping when one metric fails. These reliability fixes got added over the last year(s). ([ref](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352457#note_839039786))\n1. [x] What happens when there is a failure with receiving a payload? Do we retry that payload?\n     1. A: When a Service Ping generation fails, we retry it for three times.

with staged disclosure in the Registration flow","description":"## Experiment summary\n\nWe believe that using a [staged disclosure pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/) in the registration flow can reduce its perceived complexity, thus improving the completion rate and fasten stage adoption.\n\nTo verify that, we will create an alternate version of the registration flow. We will progressively introduce the content by creating dedicated JTBD, role, and create v.s Join steps instead of our current Welcome page which is displaying all these options in one form.\n\nAnd we’ll measure the impact on the following:\n* **Primary metric**: registration completion rate.\n* **Secondary metrics**: Time to completion, Group/project creation rates\n* **Health metrics**: D7, D14 Retention rates for group, Trial adoption rate, Conversion rate\n\n## Hypothesis\n\u003c!-- The hypothesis represents the high-level thought process in creating the experiment but does not need to be proven in one experiment. For example, you could have a hypothesis that “users would benefit from more easily being able to start a trial” and your first experiment could fail, that doesn’t void your hypothesis only indicates you may need to think of a new iterative experiment that would still align with your hypothesis. --\u003e\n\nUsing a [Staged disclosure pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/) in the registration flow can reduce its perceived complexity, thus improve completion rate and fasten stage adoption.\n\n## Business problem\n\u003c!-- Where the hypothesis is focused on the user/customer, the business problem represents why/how an experiment in this area could positively impact the business. For example, trials represent a significant way for GitLab to produce valuable leads for the sales team. --\u003e\n\nThe registration flow is a critical part to help users getting started with GitLab. The faster we lead new users to product value the better chance we have to facilitate the platform adoption.\n\n## Supporting data\n\u003c!-- Why should we run this experiment? What’s the potential impact? Show supporting data that’s both qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative example, we generate 30,000 sign ups a month and 900 trails within 90 days (3%) with a close rate of 10% and an IACV of $400.  If we’re able to increase our trial volume by 10% percent (990 trials a month) we will generate an additional $3,600 IACV if our close rates remain constant. Qualitative example, in searching Zendesk I was able to find 10 support tickets in the last 30 days that referenced difficulties with starting a trial due to the user not being an admin. (all numbers are hypothetical and only listed for the purpose of having an example) --\u003e\n\n### Qualitative\n[Solution Validation: Test SaaS registration flow visions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1785)\n\n### Quantitative \nTO ADD BASELINE REG FLOW DATA\n\n## Expected outcome\n\u003c!-- What is the expected outcome of this experiment, what metric are we trying to move? Are there any metrics we know we do not want to impact? For example, we want to impact IACV by increasing the rate at which users start trials within 30 days but we also want to ensure we don't increase the churn rate for users who've recently purchased. --\u003e\n\n* Primary metric: Increase in registration completion rate \n* Secondary metrics: Decrease in Time to completion, Increase or steady Group/project creation rates\n* Health metrics: Steady D7, D14 Retention rates for group, Steady Trial adoption rate, Steady Conversion rate\n\n## Experiment design \u0026 implementation\n\u003c!-- What is the experiment we’re going to run? How long do you believe it will need to run to reach significance? For example, our experiment would be to allow non-admins to request a trial through their admin, to detect a 10% change from our baseline conversion rate we’ll need a sample size of 57,000 (source Optimizely), with our current sign up rate of 30,000 a month this experiment will need to run for ~2 months.

This section is also helpful in framing possible scenarios and to keep the door open for the next steps. For example, we’re hoping our experiment will increase the number of people that start a trial but we’re assuming the conversion rate to paid and IACV will remain the same. This is a known assumption and depending on the results of the experiment could impact the direction we take on any future iterations. --\u003e\n\n## Results, lessons learned, next steps\n\u003c!-- What were the results of the experiment? Was the experiment a success or a failure? Based on the results should we remove the code or advocate that it become a permanent part of the experience for all users? Are there future experiments the team is going to run based off these results (include a link to new issue)? For example, our trial experiment was successful we increased the trial create rate by 10% but we saw a 1% drop in our close rate which means our net impact on IACV was negative $360 (990 * 0.09 * 400 compared tot he control of 900 * 0.1 * 400). Our next experiment (link) will focus on increasing the value once a user starts a trial.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26781) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26781) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

According to the group [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html) the 2FA status of the members of a group/project should be only visible to the owners/maintainers of the groups/projects \u0026 only they should be able to filter members on the basis of it. But the source code of the members list page is leaking the 2FA status of all the users.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick here to view\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce  \nI've created a simple python script for easy reproduction:  \n1.  Install dependencies  \n```  \npip3 install beautifulsoup4  \n```  \n2. Create a python file with the following code  \n```  \nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup  \nimport requests  \nimport sys  \nimport json  \ngroup_name = sys.argv[1]  \nres = requests.get(f\"https://gitlab.com/groups/{group_name}/-/group_members\")  \ndata = res.content  \nsoup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')  \ndiv = soup.find(\"div\", {\"class\": \"js-group-members-list-app\"})  \nres = json.loads(div[\"data-members-data\"])  \nfor member in res[\"user\"][\"members\"]:  \n\tprint(f'Username: {member[\"user\"][\"username\"]}, 2FA Enabled: {member[\"user\"][\"two_factor_enabled\"]}')  \n```  \n3. Run the python script with the group name for which you want to expose the 2FA status of.  \nI've created a group for testing called 2fa_check, you can use it too.  \n```  \npython3 get_2fa_status.py 2fa2  \n```  \n4. You would see the 2FA status of the members of the group being printed.\n\n![Screenshot_from_2022-02-04_00-04-49.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/d982ee4e-eb8d-41b0-9fd5-a6a5070068b0/Screenshot_from_2022-02-04_00-04-49.png)\n\nYou can check the same group as you are not member of the group but still you will get the results.\n\n####  Impact\n\nTwo factor authentication is a confidential security related PII data of the members which should not be accessible to the anyone except the owners/maintainers of projects/groups. An attacker would be able to retrieve this information easily using this vulnerability.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_from_2022-02-04_00-04-49.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/d982ee4e-eb8d-41b0-9fd5-a6a5070068b0/Screenshot_from_2022-02-04_00-04-49.png)\n* [get_2fa_status.py](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/9610d115-e14b-44a6-b86d-28b4ad85fc48/get_2fa_status.py)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\n\n1. Open browser of choice's Developer Tools (or use cURL)\n1. As a logged out user, open any Group Members page for a public group. \n    1. N.b. also works for logged in users looking at any Group you're a member of, or as a logged in user looking at public groups that you're not a member of\n1. Scroll through the server-provided response and look for a `div` with the class `js-group-members-list-app` (not the browser-rendered response)\n1. View html encoded user deetz, incl. MFA status\n\nIn the below example, you see a signed out view of a public group, disclosing MFA status.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-02-08_at_3.58.03_PM](/uploads/596226ac6c6ebe5aab59723d1c129bf2/Screen_Shot_2022-02-08_at_3.58.03_PM.png)\n\n\n### TODO / Other vulnerable endpoints\n\n✅ The Group Members API seems fine:\n\n```\n[{\"id\":24,\"username\":\"victim\",\"name\":\"Vic Tim\",\"state\":\"active\",\"avatar_url\":\"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cde15812b77a38321e6696050acb6d2c?s=80\\u0026d=identicon\",\"web_url\":\"http://gdk.test:3000/victim\",\"access_level\":50,\"created_at\":\"2022-02-08T02:28:04.698Z\",\"expires_at\":null,\"membership_state\":\"active\"},{\"id\":8,\"username\":\"jeff_collins\",\"name\":\"Annita Weimann\",\"state\":\"active\",\"avatar_url\":\"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/426f608516a49b9c7d5c78abc659c9cb?s=80\\u0026d=identicon\",\"web_url\":\"http://gdk.test:3000/jeff_collins\",\"access_level\":10,\"created_at\":\"2022-02-08T02:46:20.063Z\",\"expires_at\":null,\"membership_state\":\"active\"},{\"id\":22,\"username\":\"nm\",\"name\":\"Nick Malcolm\",\"state\":\"active\",\"avatar_url\":\"http://gdk.test:3000/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/22/avatar.png\",\"web_url\":\"http://gdk.test:3000/nm\",\"access_level\":10,\"created_at\":\"2022-02-08T02:46:20.221Z\",\"expires_at\":null,\"membership_state\":\"active\"}]\n```\n\n❓ GraphQL API\n\n❓ Projects Members page\n\n❓ What else?\n\n\n### Why is this happening?\n\nI (@nmalcolm) think it's because the UI shows badges to owners/maintainers, but the page response is returning it to everyone. E.g. here's the AppSec team:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-02-08_at_4.02.32_PM](/uploads/bc3f3e567266c480a9cbefba7cc885d0/Screen_Shot_2022-02-08_at_4.02.32_PM.png)\n\n### Why is this bad?\n\nWell, we say we only show this status to a certain Role, so it's at least a documentation update if intentional.\n\nBut as an attacker, being able to see which users (e.g. of a popular open source project) has MFA disabled means I know who to target in a phishing attack. Or if I have a list of breached passwords, I can more easily know which accounts to skip because MFA is protecting them.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-08T02:54:28.517Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T04:28:40.420Z","closed_at":"2022-06-30T19:47:32.705Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Deliverable","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-200","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::awaiting security release"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-05-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352210","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352210","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352210/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/352210/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#352210","relative":"#352210","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#352210"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102027258,"iid":352200,"project_id":278964,"title":"Play multiple jobs from a pipeline from UI","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated.

ISBOM manifest file structure","description":"### Proposal\n\nFollowing on from the [Manifest file format](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343403#note_820428718) discussion in [Create plan for ISBOM rollout](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343403), we need to determine the exact structure for this file.\n\nFor example, the following structure was discussed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343403#note_820456582):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"contents\": [\n    {\n      \"sbom\": {\n        \"path\": \"cyclonedx-ruby-bundler.json\",\n        \"sha256\": \"d0dec51ee8a7ba8181a9913a694943f38cb0dc21b2971f25c9fcdeaed826b58d\",\n        \"source\": \"git\"\n      },\n      \"build_file\": {\n        \"path\": \"ruby-project/Gemfile\",\n        \"sha256\": \"b8bb034f9b63bd0254fbc7c157cae746c75853f4643d6cea844dc48ddb57f522\",\n        \"source\": \"git\"\n      },\n      \"lock_file\": {\n        \"path\": \"ruby-project/Gemfile.lock\",\n        \"sha256\": \"e8d8f69393a36afb774a6fd8a2a82e0ca56f7284b2c66fe3a8890e1d05ed05bd\",\n        \"source\": \"git\"\n      },\n      \"package_manager\": {\n        \"name\": \"bundler\",\n        \"type\": \"gem\",\n        \"version\": \"3.2.20\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAs was using a `files` array with a `type` [for each file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343403#note_832810564):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"contents\": [\n    {\n      \"project\": {\n        \"name\": \"root\"\n      },\n      \"files\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"sbom\",\n          \"path\": \"cyclonedx-sbt.json\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"build_file\",\n          \"path\": \"build.gradle\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"project\": {\n        \"name\": \"proj1\"\n      },\n      \"files\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"sbom\",\n          \"path\": \"proj1/cyclonedx-sbt.json\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"build_file\",\n          \"path\": \"build.gradle\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"project\": {\n        \"name\": \"proj2\"\n      },\n      \"files\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"sbom\",\n          \"path\": \"proj2/cyclonedx-sbt.json\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"build_file\",\n          \"path\": \"build.gradle\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to figure out the exact file format of the manifest file, taking into account the following:\n\n1. It should allow us to efficiently retrieve the data we want. For example, we may want the frontend to be able to display all files with package type `gem` - the manifest file should make it easy for us to fetch this data.\n1. It needs to be compressed.\n1. It needs to properly handle subprojects that don't have their own build/lock files, and instead inherit one of these files from a parent project.\n1. It must provide links between the vulnerabilities in the `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` file and the dependencies in the CycloneDX report. Each component in the CycloneDX report will have a `purl` or \"package URL\", which is a URL string used to identify and locate a software package. We need to investigate whether this purl is sufficient to provide a link between vulnerabilities and dependencies.\n\n/cc @NicoleSchwartz @gonzoyumo @fcatteau\n\n\u003c!-- start-discoto-summary --\u003e\n## Auto-Summary :robot:\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eDiscoto Usage\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n---\n\n\u003e **Points**\n\u003e\n\u003e Discussion points are declared by headings, list items, and single\n\u003e lines that start with the text (case-insensitive) `point:`.

The widget will likely display one CTA (compare all plans)\n- [x] Refresh the page. Both CTAs (either Upgrade to Ultimate and Compare All Plans - control; Contact Sales and Compare all plans for the current running 80/20 Active trial status connect with Sales experiment) will appear. \n- [x] Take your cursor elsewhere, the widget will close.

discussion from !78703 should be addressed:\n\n There are some additional things I've noticed, but I don't want to hold up the MR anymore on minor improvements that we can address later. I also took a stab at doing them myself, but as I mentioned over Slack, we don't really have a robust validation framework and our custom CSS semi-breaks Bootstrap's own form validation feature, so what should be simple validation checks are surprisingly difficult to implement. I'll list out the additional things here for a potential follow-up issue:\n\n1. ~~Text fields only re-validate on blur rather than on input:~~ (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81172 fixes it)\n\n|How it works elsewhere|How it works on the new vuln page|\n|-|-|\n|![Peek_2022-02-02_23-59](/uploads/794864e073fc2bc79ec15b40141fca36/Peek_2022-02-02_23-59.gif)|![Peek_2022-02-02_23-58](/uploads/00df3e234c51b6df90d9d0fd05fd0aff/Peek_2022-02-02_23-58.gif)|\n\n2. ~~The submit form button is disabled when clicked, but does not show a loading spinner in the button:~~ (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352128#note_841877428)\n\n|How it works elsewhere|How it works on the new vuln page|\n|-|-|\n|![Peek_2022-02-03_00-03](/uploads/10061a57397e76ea177eedbcb09b23c2/Peek_2022-02-03_00-03.gif)|![Peek_2022-02-03_00-02](/uploads/632cf262cd328ba30d075286dbf5c1ff/Peek_2022-02-03_00-02.gif)|\n\n3. ~~I ran into an odd bug where after creating a vulnerability and clicking the back button, the fields are filled out with the values they had before, but trying to submit the form again clears the fields.

Upon clicking that item with the intention to upgrade their existing premium group, they're directed out to the /pricing page on the Marketing site, asked to select from all three pricing options (free, premium, or ultimate), and once they select \"Ultimate\", they're directed back into the SaaS product to the checkout flow where they are only able to select from free groups to upgrade. \n\n:movie_camera:  Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=domTHCChBwE\u0026list=PL05JrBw4t0KqwJpEiSktH3JuieE4UpxKv) detailing this experience.\n\nThere's a few limitations at play here:\n1) Currently, we only have the net-new purchase flow migrated to gitlab.com, which means we can only support first time purchases of premium or ultimate (moving from free to paid). We cannot support upgrading from Premium to Ultimate. That must be done in the customer's Customer Portal instance. \n2) The top-right user profile is represents a global view of their GitLab experience. Its group agnostic, so when a user is a member of multiple groups, the interactions in this dropdown don't recognize specific actions on specific groups. It's a larger IA issue.\n\n## Proposal\n\nFor this scenario where a Premium customer wants to upgrade their group to Ultimate, we need to find a way to redirect the customer to their appropriate subscription within Customer Portal so that they can complete their upgrade.\n\n## Requirements \n- [ ] `Upgrade` item in the profile dropdown is only shown to the subscription owner - this is for any case (free or paying group)\n\n\n## Definitions\n\nThere are two different things that we call `Upgrade` to users, and they are actually very different on the backend:\n\n1. Purchasing a paid subscription for a free group\n1. Changing from one paid subscription tier to a higher tier\n\nWe are okay to use the same term - `Upgrade` - with the user (because they don't need to know the difference), but these are completely separate flows:\n\n1.

In `gitlab`, open an MR in which you modify a GraphQL description, for example in `ee/app/graphql/types/epic_sort_enum.rb`.\n1. Regenerate the documentation with `bundle exec rake gitlab:graphql:compile_docs` and commit the result.

This was noticed by `@agroleau`.\n\nWe should introduce it in GraphQL so that parity is maintained when the new experience is rolled out to external users.\n\nHere are the available GraphQL sort criteria :point_right: [ee/app/graphql/types/epic_sort_enum.rb#L15](\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/eb37dcb116ca3c9d4e533ac2e1929728d377038e/ee/app/graphql/types/epic_sort_enum.rb)\n\nHere are the available REST sort criteria :point_right: [ee/lib/api/epics.rb#L35](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/eb37dcb116ca3c9d4e533ac2e1929728d377038e/ee/lib/api/epics.rb#L35)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-04T04:18:58.576Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T19:59:39.079Z","closed_at":"2022-02-09T10:37:05.080Z","closed_by":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"labels":["automation:ml","backend","devops::plan","feature::enhancement","group::product planning","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},{"id":3717078,"username":"cablett","name":"charlie ablett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3717078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cablett"}],"author":{"id":3717078,"username":"cablett","name":"charlie ablett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3717078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cablett"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351981","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351981","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351981/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351981/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351981","relative":"#351981","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351981"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
