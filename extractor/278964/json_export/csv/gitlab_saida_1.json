Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing estimated time when this feature flag will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```\n\n\u003c!-- A feature flag can also be used for rolling out a bug fix or a maintenance work.\nIn this scenario, labels must be related to it, for example; ~\"type::feature\", ~\"type::bug\" or ~\"type::maintenance\".\nPlease use /copy_metadata to copy the labels from the issue you're rolling out. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-02T03:08:24.122Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T00:47:33.057Z","closed_at":"2023-01-06T00:47:33.025Z","closed_by":{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"},"labels":["automation:ml","devops::plan","feature flag","group::project management","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"}],"author":{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2023-01-02","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384363","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":5},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384363","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384363/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384363/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#384363","relative":"#384363","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#384363"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119708862,"iid":384326,"project_id":278964,"title":"Updating webhook via API removes secret token value","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen [creating a project hook](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#add-project-hook) you can optionally provide a `token` parameter and value to define a secret token for the webhook. \n\nIf you then [edit that hook](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#edit-project-hook) via the API, the secret token is erased, even if no `token` parameter was provided. This means you must now provide a `token` parameter and value each time you edit a webhook, or you risk losing that value entirely. \n\nThis was reported by a [Premium customer](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/350244) who states this only recently started occurring. I can confirm that this does not occur on a self-managed installation running 15.2.0. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. In a test project of your choosing, add a project hook [via the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#add-project-hook). Be sure to provide a `token` parameter and value. \n2. Navigate to the webhook via project settings \u003e\u003e webhooks. Click the \"edit\" button on the webhook you created, and observe the populated \"Secret token\" field. \n3. Note the webhook ID from the URL and use this value to [edit the webhook via the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#edit-project-hook). Do not provide the `token` parameter. \n4. Navigate back to the webhook and note the \"Secret token\" field has been stripped. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe \"secret token\" value is removed from webhooks when updated via the API.  \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe \"secret token\" value is not removed from the webhook unless you specifically include an empty `token` parameter value you in your request. \n\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, uncomment below --\u003e\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nPlease ensure `e2e:package-and-test` job passes in the MR that removes the feature flag. Feel free to reach out to the SET (@a_mcdonald) for assistance.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T21:23:37.144Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T22:19:03.382Z","closed_at":"2022-12-24T13:57:22.873Z","closed_by":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian

Something like `GET /api/v4/projects/:id/repository/tags/:name/signature`.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nEvery user can configure their keys to make GitLab's verification of the tags accurate. It doesn't seem feasible to duplicate this verification locally, so there is no way for automation to know if a tag has a valid signature or not.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd new API endpoint, `GET /api/v4/projects/:id/repository/tags/:name/signature`, that behaves like `GET /projects/:id/repository/commits/:sha/signature` does for commits. cf. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#get-gpg-signature-of-a-commit\n\n### Intended users\n\nUsed by anyone who automates CICD operations. The capability to verify tag signatures can be used to harden audit trails trails and increase\ntrust in any information stored in tags, which increases GitOps security.\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n### Feature Usage Metrics\n\nYou can track the usage of the feature by tracking how often the API endpoint is called.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T08:15:47.177Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T11:16:47.177Z","closed_at":"2022-12-14T10:05:32.714Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"labels":["Category:API","automation:ml","automation:self-triage-encouraged","backend","devops::create","group::source code","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":616307,"username":"OK_MF","name":"OK_MF","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8d3671a90bfcbb48a53af5006fc9824?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/OK_MF"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384116","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384116","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384116/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384116/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#384116","relative":"#384116","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#384116"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119604235,"iid":384111,"project_id":278964,"title":"Upgrade DAST HSQLDB integration tests","description":"Follow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/merge_requests/667#note_1187342839\n\n## Problem to solve\n\nDAST and ZAP are currently using HSQLDB 2.7.1 [zap_database.py#L13](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/src/zap_gateway/zap_database/zap_database.py#L13) but the test for this code uses HSQLDB 2.5.0.\n\nSimply updating [test_zap_database.py#L12](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/test/integration/test_zap_database.py#L12) to use HSQLDB 2.7.1 or even 2.5.2 does not work as [test_can_retrieve_inserted_values](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/test/integration/test_zap_database.py#L15) and [`test_can_reconnect_to_a_closed_database`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/test/integration/test_zap_database.py#L55) both fail.\n\nThis does NOT mean that DAST is broken. During a scan, DAST connects and reads from the ZAP HSQLDB session which is tested in the e2e tests and [`test_can_read_zap_database`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/test/integration/test_zap_database.py#L29) which continues to work.\n\nAt present, it seems that the issue could lie in initializing a new database through [jaydebeapi](https://github.com/baztian/jaydebeapi) but this is unconfirmed. The library has not been updated for some time and changes in HSQLDB might not have been reflected in this plugin. This needs further investigation. \n\nNote: changing [`_database`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/src/zap_gateway/zap_database/zap_database.py#L72) to return the database file name rather than the database name causes [test_zap_database.py#L12](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/test/integration/test_zap_database.py#L12) to pass but breaks the other tests and the e2e tests.\n\nCode that causes [test_zap_database.py#L12](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/blob/bc4911b0317b5cf556f5c1898aeddd3c7dbdf0d6/test/integration/test_zap_database.py#L12) to pass\n\n```python\n    def _database(self) -\u003e str:\n        database = path.join(self._database_dir, f'{Settings.SESSION_NAME}.session')\n        data_file = f'{database}.data'\n\n        if not path.exists(data_file):\n            raise RuntimeError(f'Failed to find ZAP database {data_file}')\n        return data_file #updated from database\n```\n\n### Options\n\n1) Upgrade the integration test to HSQLDB 2.7.1 and delete the failing tests, as DAST does not create its own database. The risk here is that a subsequent ZAP and HSQLDB upgrade might stop DAST from connecting to the database at all. At that point, we'll need to address this issue.\n2) Continue investigation, possibly forking https://github.com/baztian/jaydebeapi if an issue is found.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T06:37:24.538Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T03:22:39.785Z","closed_at":"2022-12-01T03:22:39.760Z","closed_by":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"labels":["Category:DAST","dast::zap","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","maintenance::test-gap","section::sec","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"}],"author":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384111","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384111","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384111/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384111/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#384111","relative":"#384111","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#384111"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119549911,"iid":384024,"project_id":278964,"title":"Check access to epic's parent in group export","description":"When introducing [cross-group child epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8502) there might be cases where the user cannot read an epic's parent, even if they have permissions to export the group.

Like a button beside the check to re-run the check. We currently use something like that for site validation for DAST profiles. As a first iteration, that would make this a lot more useable when the checks are blocking an MR.\n\n\u003e Yes, we will need backend work. Outside of the 3 actions mentioned [in the doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/status_checks.html), we currently have no way of triggering the webhook that informs the external service to run a check, so we need a new API endpoint for it.\n\n\u003e Here is the [figma link to the designs](https://www.figma.com/file/zqEjEpLS0ggRsbUdzDrWkj/Retry-button-%5BGovern%2FCompliance%23383200%5D?node-id=24%3A7586\u0026t=fyH8him9zvfP4o7n-1)\n\n\u003e Regarding the `Retry` button, we'll need to work with Foundations to make sure we're using the merge report framework correctly. For example, would you expect to see `Retry` on each individual failed check (the `GitBot` example [posted above](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8516#note_1175253079)), or should it only be on the top level (ie 2 failed status checks - Retry all failed checks)\n\n\n~backend Create an API to retry the failed status check.\n\n## Purposed Implementation Plan\n\nweight: :two: \n\n1.

User `merge_request.to_hook_data(current_user)` to generate current state payload\n3. Async post this data payload to status checks url\n4.

This header is used for authenticating the scanner to the target application. The authentication tokens will be accessible to anyone who has access to the vulnerability. \n\nExample https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec/dast-scan-4-fedramp/-/security/vulnerabilities/62832546\n\nEven though it is recommended to run scans on non-production environments, authentication credentials are sensitive information and are recommended to be masked or removed from the vulnerability to prevent unintended leaks. There could be also cases where scans are run on production environments because of various compliance/certification requirements in which case this issue will lead to production credential leaks.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun authenticated API scan and check the vulnerability report.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec/dast-scan-4-fedramp/-/security/vulnerabilities/62832546\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAuthentication credentials are included in the vulnerability.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAuthentication credentials are not included in the vulnerability.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screenshot_2022-11-17_at_15.12.58](/uploads/e62a4c99d33d7b78acf1370e6af3fe34/Screenshot_2022-11-17_at_15.12.58.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. [X] Replace `Authorization` header value with `XXXXXXXXXX` (10 `X` characters)\n1. [X] Replace in report vulnerability details\n1. [x] Replace in Postman file generation\n1.

The `repomd.xml` file was not referencing the right path for each xml file.\n1. `pkgid` was empty and not used through the different xml files.\n\n## :fire_engine: Solutions\n\nHere are my suggestions for each issue:\n\n1. Check why the authentication is not working. It should work, that could is being used in other package formats.\n1. Since we do have the [freedom](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296785#note_1070086773) (Section `Uploading a package`) to choose how to upload files, let's use a very simple form: a `PUT` body upload. This is already used by the Generic package registry for example.\n1. Use the Grape generated helper functions to get the proper path.\n1. It seems that we have the choice of the digest used here, so use `sha256` everywhere and use the `sha256` of the package file as the `pkgid`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-16T08:03:48.473Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T12:04:45.408Z","closed_at":"2022-11-17T12:04:45.376Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","RPM Repository","backend","bug::functional","devops::package","group::package registry","section::ops","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

a template (similar to other security products) which, given a path to a Spring Boot Executable Jar, will produce an OpenAPI document describing the endpoints in that jar, which is saved as an artifact.\n\n### Criteria\n\nThis initial implementation will target the lowest versions we intend to support, which will make it easier to support later versions due to backward compatibility; or the easiest to implement scenario we intend to support where version doesn't apply.\n\n- Java 8 (as the default Java version available on the runner)\n- Spring Boot 2.0.9\n- [Spring Boot Executable Jar](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html#appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.jar-structure)\n- Built with Gradle + Spring Boot plugin\n\n### Implementation\n\n- [ ] Java Executable  \nSee spike code at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/api-discovery-src/-/tree/spike-springdoc-offline\n    - [ ] Read location of jar file from environment variable, include it in classpath\n    - [ ] Start a Spring context loading Spring Boot and SpringDoc configurations\n    - [ ] Perform a component scan, excluding known non-user packages (Spring Boot, SpringDoc, GitLab, etc), to find controller beans\n    - [ ] Use SpringDoc to generate OpenAPI doc based on registered beans\n- [ ] Pipeline\n    - [ ] Builds executable\n    - [ ] Runs tests\n    - [ ] Pushes executable to staging registry\n- [ ] Template\n    - [ ] Fetches executable from (staging) registry\n    - [ ] Runs executable\n- [ ] Testing\n    - [ ] Unit tests\n    - [ ] Scenario test:\n        - [ ] Build sample target jar\n        - [ ] Run API discovery\n        - [ ] Assert the resulting doc\n    - [ ] Acceptance test:\n        - [ ] Include template in pipeline\n        - [ ] Run included job\n        - [ ] Assert doc as artifact\n- [ ] Developer Documentation  \nThis initial implementation will not attempt to create end-user documentation, since it might well have to change considerably before the product is ready to be released.

[ ] Review UBI9 .NET dockerfile to identify any new configuration that is needed. Context: The UBI .NET image isn't based on ubi-minimal, so we have created our own based on the RedHat's dockerfile.\n   1. https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhel8/dotnet-60-runtime/6182ef98c0d15aff4912fdae?container-tabs=dockerfile \n1.
