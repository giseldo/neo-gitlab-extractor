Clicking on it should open the modal.\n\n/cc @nmccorrison

Here is the relevant quote:\n\n\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/37 is based on `debian:slim`, but it installs `build-essential`. This should be avoided on \"slim\" images. There is the [buildpack-deps](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps) for such needs, but I think this is not what you want here.\n\u003e \n\u003e If Debian is used as a base image, unnecessary build dependencies should be removed after `pip install` (see the Alpine example above). `build-essential` installs a lot of Debian specific packages like `dpkg-dev` that are not required at all. This can be changed with low risks/side effects.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs discussed with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33724#note_314481785, we currently have an issue with circular dependencies where our ~\"devops::secure\" analyzers require updates and depend on a strict QA comparison to downstream test projects.\nTo quote from the above comment, @fcatteau wrote:\n\n\u003e To recap, I see two ways we can ease the pain:  \n\u003e  \n\u003e A. change the CI configuration shared by the analyzer projects so that a MR isn't blocked when the generated report doesn't match the expected one, while still making sure the change is properly reviewed  \n\u003e B. move the expected reports to the analyzer projects, so that they are updated and reviewed in the MR where the behavior of the analyzer project is changed  \n\u003e  \n\u003e A would be a smaller step for the Dependency Scanning projects, where QA using downstream pipelines has already been set up. That said, B is probably easier to set up in the SAST projects, which currently rely on embedded integration tests.  \n\u003e To me, ideally the expected reports should be with the analyzer projects (proposal B), so that they can be reviewed as the analyzer project changes. We would keep external test projects, ensuring we have realistic integration tests. If nothing else, I believe external test projects and downstream pipelines are the only way to test Auto DevOps integration.\n\u003e That said, this doesn't help with running QA jobs for MRs created by the community. See #118871 (closed) cc @ifrenkel\n\n### Intended users\n\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nLess developer pain in keeping our test projects up to date.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [x] Allow analyzers to store expectations for test projects within the analyzer project itself https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/84\n- [x] Update each SAST analyzer with its downstream expectations\n- [x] Update each DS analyzer with its downstream expectations\n- [x] Remove update QA jobs from [QA templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates), and from the test projects\n\n#### Implementation Plan\n\nFor each analyzer project:\n\nA. Move test report expectation into `analyzer` project  \nB. Specify report to downstream job via `**_REPORT_URL` within analyzer `.gitlab-ci.yml` ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/830d24fa442ab6de7be6fef2e3a5f4925907e625/.gitlab-ci.yml#L49))  \nC. Set `**_REPORT_URL` within test project `.gitlab-ci.yml` so default branch can continue to pass (for scheduled pipelines)\n\nSee example:

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32816#note_368295030):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e Could you clarify these lines here?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e It is expecting the `text_of_labels_block` to have_content, but `text_of_labels_block` returns an element, not the *text* of the element.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e def text_of_labels_block\n    \u003e   find_element(:labels_block)\n    \u003e end\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I think it'd be more correct to have:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e expect(issue.labels_block).to have_text(jira_issue_label_1)\n    \u003e expect(issue.labels_block).to have_text(jira_issue_label_2)\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e This additionally provides the benefit of relying on our framework, rather than Capybara directly :ok_hand: \n    \u003e \n    \u003e Thoughts?\n\n    @dchevalier2 \n\n\n    \u003e Honestly, I used the logic for checking labels from here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/qa/qa/specs/features/ee/browser_ui/2_plan/scoped_labels/editing_scoped_labels_spec.rb but you're right, that does make more sense to use `have_text`. Then we could get rid of `text_of_labels_block` entirely.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I can update this Jira spec but should I also update the scoped labels spec and delete `text_of_labels_block` in this MR or open another one since it's not technically in the scope of this MR?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T15:54:49.514Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T20:43:55.366Z","closed_at":"2020-06-26T20:43:55.299Z","closed_by":{"id":2097582,"username":"meks","name":"Mek Stittri","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2097582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meks"},"labels":["QA","Quality","maintenance::refactor"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

check the mentioned issue for additional details.  \n  \nFor non-`.md` files (processed by `Rouge`) we already have a set of meaningful limitations set in the code: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/highlight.rb#L6  \n  \n```\n    TIMEOUT_BACKGROUND = 30.seconds\n    TIMEOUT_FOREGROUND = 3.seconds\n    MAXIMUM_TEXT_HIGHLIGHT_SIZE = 1.megabyte\n```  \n  \n## Proposal\n\n1. Reduce `TIMEOUT_FOREGROUND` to 1.5s\n1. Reduce `MAXIMUM_TEXT_HIGHLIGHT_SIZE` to 512kb\n\n## Further information \n\nThe idea - Simplify JSON highlighting, or set the limit even more aggressive  \n  \nWhy only JSON?  \n  \n- Despite being an edge case, it seems to be a rather popular type of huge file in many repos (from what I've seen) and it could be used for marketing comparison.     \n- It seems that our competitor doesn't use \"full\" JSON highlighting, check https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/fixtures/emojis/index.json vs https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/fixtures/emojis/index.json – only Strings are being colored. \n- That means we could replace our fully-powered Rouge JSON highlighter (which seem to analyze the folding and the structure) with something more simple.\n- Another idea is to set more aggressive time limit ^\n- And, alternatively, we could drop the JSON highlighting at all (probably not the best solution).  \n  \nAnyway, it just an idea to explore.  \n  \nI personally tend to think that simplifying the highlighting logic (using more lightweight unit) may be a good idea, but it would already change the presentation of our JSON files (facing the user), so it should be discussed with the appropriate team and (probably) stakeholders.  \n \n  \n  \n~\"group::source code\" Is it something you may be interested to consider adding into your backlog?  \n  \n---\n  \n@joshlambert Joshua, I am not sure I could mention someone or just adding the team label is enough?  \ncc @craig-gomes @nmilojevic1 @grantyoung – just FYI","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T11:10:17.916Z","updated_at":"2021-06-02T10:30:33.185Z","closed_at":"2020-09-01T10:54:50.116Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"labels":["backend","bug::performance","devops::create","group::source code","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"}],"author":{"id":4087087,"username":"alipniagov","name":"Aleksei Lipniagov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087087/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alipniagov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224506","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224506","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224506/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224506/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#224506","relative":"#224506","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#224506"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3382,"epic":{"id":57568,"iid":3382,"title":"Single Blob performance optimizations","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3382","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":50069383,"iid":224499,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add Graphql/AuthorizeType cop to EE namespaced types","description":"## What is the GitLab engineering productivity problem to solve?\n\nUnlike CE GraphQL types, EE-only GraphQL types do not have RuboCop enforce the use of `authorize`.

So it should be safe to drop [`trace` parameter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/runner.rb#L151) from `PUT /api/jobs/:id` endpoint in GitLab-Rails.\n\nThis ensures that a problem like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24176 does not matter, that when the [`job.trace.set(params[:trace])`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/runner.rb#L158) runs in [the new live trace architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/job_logs.html#new-incremental-logging-architecture), puma (api-nodes) tries to manipulate chunks in object storage (which has already been moved from redis) through `ChunkedIO`.

Users should be able to use double star globs in the patterns provided. As we can see in the MR and related QA tests, patterns like `**/test/*` are accepted without any warning, but won't work as what we can expect (all folders named `test` in the current tree).\n\nStarting from %13.0, the CI config supports globs and double starts in [cache:paths](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#cachepaths) using\n[doublestar.Glob](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar@v1.2.2?tab=doc#Match). The path filters for SAST and Dependency Scanning could also use [doublestar.Glob](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar@v1.2.2?tab=doc#Match) to support globs, and to improve consistency. Also, this would reduce maintenance cost, and the need for documentation.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nUse [doublestar.Glob](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar@v1.2.2?tab=doc#Match) in the [pathfilter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/tree/v2.10.3/pathfilter) package of the analyzer [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) library. The unit tests need to be updated but the interface remains the same, so the analyzer projects won't change. We should maintain backwards compatibility with the existing behaviour of `pathfilter.Match` (namely the support around gitignore-style matching).\n\nAlternatively, we should better document the existing behavior, and the discrepancy b/w the patterns supported by `catche:paths` and the `*_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variables.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. Introduce the [doublestar](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar) package to the [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) library. An [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/merge_requests/162) is in progress.\n   - Add tests containing globstar (**) patterns to [match_test.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/master/pathfilter/match_test.go).\n   - Modify the [Match](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/330a662dbd14332e7e2bf5d13060dc8d5e99be38/pathfilter/match.go#L24) function to match patterns using `doublestar.Match` instead of `filepath.Match` under certain conditions (globstar patterns should not be truncated).\n   - Release a new minor version of `common`.\n1. Bump the [`command`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/command) package to use the new version of `common`. Analysers filter paths via this package.\n1. Bump the `command` (and also `common`, might as well) package in the following analysers and release a new minor version of each. Note that many analysers are using v1 or v2 of `common`, so in addition to `go.mod` the import paths will need to be updated to `v3`. The main change in `v3` is [removing the deprecated `command` and `issue` modules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/merge_requests/158) from the source. All analysers should already have been updated to use the replacements, so there should be minimal change updating to `v3` of `common`.\n   - Think about automating this process using a script.\n\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/brakeman\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/mobsf\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/flawfinder\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/sobelow\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/phpcs-security-audit\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kubesec\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs\n1. Modify the SAST and DS documentation. A [draft MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91338) has been prepared.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdate [SAST docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html) and [Dependency Scanning docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html).\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nCurrently, `SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS` and `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` are not covered by QA. We might want to address that behavior switching to [doublestar](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar@v1.2.2?tab=doc#Match), and possibly changing the behavior. Or, we can considered that unit tests are sufficient, in the `common` library.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes, it applies to all analyzers maintained by ~\"devops::secure\", except ~\"Category:DAST\".\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35037#note_367455440","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-24T20:28:15.064Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T12:05:39.675Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T20:58:16.625Z","closed_by":{"id":11872546,"username":"amarpatel","name":"Amar Patel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11872546/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amarpatel"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:SAST","Category:Secret Detection","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","frontend","group::static analysis","internal customer","missed-deliverable","missed:15.2","release post item","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":11648083,"username":"jamesliu-gitlab","name":"James Liu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11648083/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamesliu-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":30915,"username":"plafoucriere","name":"Philippe Lafoucrière","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/30915/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/plafoucriere"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11648083,"username":"jamesliu-gitlab","name":"James Liu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11648083/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jamesliu-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224440","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":14,"completed_count":14},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"14 of 14 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224440","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224440/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224440/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#224440","relative":"#224440","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#224440"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4487,"epic":{"id":116448,"iid":4487,"title":"Secure Cross-Group Requests for User Experience improvements to all scan types","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4487","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":50038870,"iid":224232,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move compliance framework project labels from Ultimate to Premium","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWe introduced [compliance framework project labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/#compliance-framework-ultimate) in %\"12.10\", but have since introduced additional features that conflict with the pricing tier of this feature. For example, we want to leverage these project labels to allow administrators to [limit the scope of instance-level settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33923) to specific compliance framework-labeled projects.\n\nCurrently, organizations must be in `Ultimate` to label a project with a specific compliance framework, but have access to these labels as a refinement mechanism in the `admin area` in `Premium`. To reconcile this difference and to [move the feature down quickly](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#if-a-feature-can-be-moved-down-do-it-quickly), we should move this new feature (compliance framework labels for projects) from `Ultimate` to `Premium`.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nA `Premium` or above GitLab customer can apply a compliance framework label to their projects **and** reduce the scope of inheritance on instance-level settings based on these labels.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nMove [compliance framework project labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/#compliance-framework-ultimate) from `Ultimate` to `Premium`\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis feature was recently launched in %\"12.10\" and should be more broadly available in `Premium` both to satisfy customer needs and reconcile the discrepancy between the two mentioned features.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-24T17:07:55.415Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T22:03:25.566Z","closed_at":"2020-07-02T12:50:19.022Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Stretch","devops::manage","group::compliance","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":4748651,"username":"mattgonzales-gitlab","name":"Matt Gonzales (ex-GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748651/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mattgonzales-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224232","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224232","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224232/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224232/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#224232","relative":"#224232","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#224232"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":50038211,"iid":224222,"project_id":278964,"title":"Invert booleans in has_create_events? method","description":"Details https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35154#note_367545341\n\n\u003e Agree, the default case is that create events are implemented.

This accordion will promote the value of adding required approvers to merge request.  This feature discovery element will only be available to admin (permissions level of `50` frontend name of Owner) of a project/group with the ability to start a trial.\n \n* The accordion will be open for all users in the experiment the first time they view it. \n* If a user collapses the accordion we should remember that state and leave it collapsed when they open MR again in the future\n* In the initial MVC experiment if a user selects to start a trial then they will be landed on the group overview page after the trial is started which is the default trial experience. \n   * A future iteration on this experiment will test bringing the user back into the MR creation process where we can highlight the required merge request approval section, note this will be a separate follow up experiment.\n\n#### Accordion \n \n![accordion-interaction-to-trial](/uploads/b52a0782ceb6b54fec050262e08c953c/accordion-interaction-to-trial.gif)\n \n####

If we provide a way to \"render full MR\", it should be a much quicker and tuned experience for the goal they're tring to achieve (\"read this one comment on this one MR\").\n\nThis is how they do it on imgur.com, for example:\n\nLink: https://imgur.com/gallery/JxsCE/comment/576492321\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/3ec9d261c21a840d4e61f8630971d2c2/Screenshot_2020-06-24_at_11.37.42.png\" width=\"600\"\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n(Anyone who uses MRs, really)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nReduce the time from **clicking the link of a MR Diff Discussion** to **displaying the desired comment**.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen you follow the link to a discussion, like:\n\n`https://gitlab.com/andr3/meet.andr3.net/-/merge_requests/24/diffs#note_363714858`\n\n`363714858` is the `note.id`\n\n(in the store: `notes.discussions[n].notes[n].id` [screenshot](/uploads/97cdf45b50fadf949235b0fe320bde4e/Screenshot_2020-06-24_at_12.25.26.png))\n\nIn it, we can look into `diff_file` to get the relevant file.\n\n@iamphill suggested we can use the array in the `diffs_metadata.json` call and figure out which \"page\" of `diffs_batch.json` to request from the server.\n\n#### UI proposal\n\n![Screenshot_2020-06-24_at_11.47.20](/uploads/fe58798fc49526468fa591c96f533f76/Screenshot_2020-06-24_at_11.47.20.png)\n\n### Further details\n\nAnother aspect to consider is whether this could enable the file-by-file mode. :thinking: \n\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n* We'll probably need to revise screenshots of the Discussions section.\n* Also add one for this particular behaviour.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nThe switch to \"load all files\" should definitely be tested.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nThe aforementioned time will decrease.\n\nMore specifically, \"time to discussion shown\", from render.\n\nNote: we shouldn't compare time from click as network timings will affect the result.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nThis only applies to Diffs but might be worth double checking the Discussion tab and the Issues are unaffected. (~\"devops::plan\").\n\n### Links /

Groups have no such equivalent. The feature for push rules for groups in the UI is fairly new (issue: #34370) but didn't appear to include the development of an API.\n\nHere's the documentation of the push rules API for projects: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#push-rules-starter\n\n### Intended users\n\nAnybody in a group managed account that wants to script the management (create/edit/delete) of push rules for groups in the GitLab API.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd API functionality, and matching documentation, for creating/editing/destroying (sub)group level push rules.\n\n- [x] Drop [feature flag for Group Push Rule](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#group-push-rules-starter)  - **Verification complete on staging**\n- [x] Retrieve group push rules `GET /groups/:id/push_rule` - **Verification complete**\n- [x] Add group push rules `POST /groups/:id/push_rule` - **Verification complete**\n- [x] Edit group push rules `PUT /groups/:id/push_rule` - **Verification complete**\n- [x] Delete group push rules `DELETE /groups/:id/push_rule` - **Verification complete**\n\n### Further details\n\nWe have a need for push rules to be set across our namespace, however, for a temporary period of time we would like certain subgroups to be opted out of these push rules while code from a deprecating SCM is being mirrored over into GitLab. Our namespace contains several thousand projects, so doing this manually in the UI would be a poor experience.\n\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-24T03:55:28.033Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T18:11:38.424Z","closed_at":"2020-09-04T17:04:09.926Z","closed_by":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","api","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","group::compliance","priority::2","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"}],"author":{"id":5456619,"username":"bbutler38","name":"Brandon Butler","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5456619/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bbutler38"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":13,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224129","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224129","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224129/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224129/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#224129","relative":"#224129","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#224129"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":50004825,"iid":224109,"project_id":278964,"title":"Track unique visitors to Compliance pages in usage ping (Compliance Paid GMAU)","description":"## Problem\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/general-discussion/-/issues/17232, we described the need for a Group MAU for Compliance.

These methods join the `Routes` table and effectively perform a string prefix match on the project path. My assumption is that this was faster and easier than recursively crawling the entire namespace hierarchy.\n\nHowever, now we can pull the entire namespace hierarchy in linear time with `where('traversal_ids = ARRAY[?]::integer[]', root_traversal_id).first`. Then we can join with the `projects` table by matching foreign keys rather than parsing route strings which should lead to better performance.\n\nI propose that this refactor keep `Project::inside_path` and refactor the methods that call this method.\n\n## Improvements\n\n1. I would expect this to improve query times.\n2. Associations via the `routes` table are ... questionable 😆 \n3. Joining by underlying architecture is less of a surprise, and more robust.\n\n## Risks\n\nMaybe my assumption for the motivation behind joining by routes is incorrect.\n\n## Involved components\n\n- app/models/namespace.rb\n- app/models/project.rb\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n- Faster queries\n- Cleaner architecture\n\nWe should not approach this issue until feature flags have been removed for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34826\n\n\n/cc @ifarkas @lmcandrew","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-23T07:21:43.054Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T07:06:26.480Z","closed_at":"2021-06-14T07:06:26.472Z","closed_by":{"id":4092171,"username":"alexpooley","name":"Alex Pooley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4092171/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexpooley"},"labels":["backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","section::dev"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4092171,"username":"alexpooley","name":"Alex Pooley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4092171/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexpooley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223821","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223821","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223821/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223821/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#223821","relative":"#223821","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#223821"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4115,"epic":{"id":90156,"iid":4115,"title":"Faster namespace queries","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4115","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":49936867,"iid":223817,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Step 4] Backfill snippet statistics and project snippets size","description":"We need to create/populate all statistics from existing project snippets.

If this is too big a problem to solve on our first pass, we will break progressive loading into its own issue and come back to it.\n\n### Visual\n\n![Issues Opened and Closed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/64d39e4bf00429bdec533e91d4d83ba4/Group_activity__issues.png)\n\n### Reference\n\nGroup Recent Activity: Issues [design issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217331)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-23T01:17:29.550Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T12:34:58.100Z","closed_at":"2020-08-13T12:34:58.069Z","closed_by":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::manage","estimation::completed","frontend","group::optimize","priority::3","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5538811,"username":"jshackelford","name":"John-Mason Shackelford","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5538811/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jshackelford"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223798","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223798","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223798/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/223798/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#223798","relative":"#223798","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#223798"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3214,"epic":{"id":50415,"iid":3214,"title":"Report Pages","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3214","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":49931263,"iid":223793,"project_id":278964,"title":"API to bulk delete artifacts","description":"\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n### Release notes\n\nSetting an aggressive expiration policy for artifacts is one strategy for managing storage consumption, but sometimes you need the ability to reduce storage right away. While previously you may have relied on a script to automate the tedious task of calling the API to delete an artifact one by one, now you can use a new endpoint to bulk delete job artifacts. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/job_artifacts.html#delete-artifacts\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nToday there is no method to clean up old artifacts in bulk, short of writing your own script using the API. This present a challenge, as Artifacts are a major driver of storage consumption and many users today do not have any expiration policy set (currently by default artifacts never expire).\n\nEven future work to set a default of one-year expiration may not clean up old artifacts quickly enough to reduce usage below limits defined for storage quotas.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nGive users an API to deleting artifacts in bulk without them having to write their own scripts in the API or deleting these by hand one by one.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nCreate an API to bulk delete artifacts per project. The scope of work for this issue is to delete artifacts for a given project via an API endpoint.  \n\n#### Out of scope (follow-ups)\n\nAdd parameters to bulk delete endpoints:\n* `delete_all`: should allow for the deletion of non-erasable artifacts(trace files)\n* `delete_tags`: delete artifacts also for tags,\n* `keep_n`: keep N last artifacts for succesful pipelines on each branch,\n* `delete_orphaned`: delete all orphaned branch and tags (no longer present in git repo),\n* `older_than`: delete older than\n\nDelete all of the artifacts for a given group.\n\n#### Technical approach\n\nExtract the part which [removes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9fc33b5917423111cbff1d0c25544cbbabbb1ce3/app/services/ci/destroy_expired_job_artifacts_service.rb#L71-80) expired artifacts into a new service that accepts an array of job artifacts. This service could be reused for this API. Note we should remove only [erasable artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9fc33b5917423111cbff1d0c25544cbbabbb1ce3/app/models/ci/job_artifact.rb#L164-169) by default.\n\n### Further details\n\nWe are working to apply a default expiration, but to avoid deleting important customer data we have a long grace period where users can retain their artifacts: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/10177, currently artifacts will not expire sooner than 1 year.\n\nThe support team has workaround process to do something similar, documented at: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/job_artifacts.html#delete-job-artifacts-from-jobs-completed-before-a-specific-date\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nWho can use this API for a project is critical. Similar to the existing [CI/CD permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#gitlab-cicd-permissions) related to deleting a project use of this API should be limited to maintainers and owners.\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document.
