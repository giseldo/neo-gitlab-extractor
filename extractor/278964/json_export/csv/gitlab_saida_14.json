flag] Rollout of `ci_remove_userless_ci`","description":"\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363711) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_remove_userless_ci` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Pipeline Execution\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline_execution`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @allison.browne \n- PM: @jheimbuck_gl \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nAn extremely legacy use case of builds being authorized without users is completely blocked. The only time we should see this code path triggered is if 6 year old builds are run.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nLegit builds could be blocked from accessing git pulls.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nSentry errors for GitAccess class\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 03dd18efdfa70c0cff8d13fa1f968787dde33142`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_remove_userless_ci true --dev --staging --staging-ref`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 03dd18efdfa70c0cff8d13fa1f968787dde33142`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_remove_userless_ci true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/97828) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_pipeline_execution`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_remove_userless_ci 50 --actors`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_remove_userless_ci true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/97828) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `ci_remove_userless_ci` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ask for review and merge it. \n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete ci_remove_userless_ci --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_remove_userless_ci false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-20T18:22:11.743Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T12:09:20.166Z","closed_at":"2022-10-19T15:10:43.066Z","closed_by":{"id":4626651,"username":"allison.browne","name":"Allison

a call-to-action to the version indicator","description":"## Overview\n\nPer [Slack discussion](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CLW71KM96/p1658329707743669), there was feedback on adding a call-to-action on click the indicator.\n\n![image](/uploads/17fdf5b67306d8056541a80221e6f9ce/image.png)\n\nSince the current badge only behaves as an indicator without giving guidance on action, it makes sense to connect to **how to upgrade the instance.**\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Provide a link to the SSOT for users for immediate action.\n - Link: `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/`\n\n### Details\n\nThere are three badges across the UI and we'd like to add CTA for three areas.\nAnd then we could consider implementing and tracking the behavior using the Snowplow.\n\n| Dropdown | Admin dashboard  | Help docs(`/help`) |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![dropdown](/uploads/f2c41d84a01f5ee936e7e0dea73bd46d/dropdown.png) |

dropdown option\n- In the admin dashboard and the help page: users could click the [actionable badges](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/docs/base-badge--actionable)\n  - All points lead users to `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/` for the easier upgrade.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-20T16:22:17.637Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T23:51:03.556Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T14:22:38.361Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack

In Kubernetes 1.25 there will be changes to the plugins - no plugin code will be bundled. See: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke.\n\nAt the moment agentk uses `1.24.2` libraries with all the plugins bundles (compiled into the binary). When deployed to a cluster of any version, agentk will use the plugins it has. Because of that, this change will not break existing or future users of agentk.\n\nBefore updating to `1.25` or newer libraries we need to investigate what we need to do to be compatible with all Kubernetes versions we support at that moment.\n\nRelevant links in random order:\n\n- https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/541-external-credential-providers\n-

Today, it generates reports in version `14-0-4`. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/-/blob/v3.12.2/version.go#L16\n\n#368140 updates the `report` library so that it can also generate reports in version `15-0-0` without loosing the ability to generate reports in version `14-0-4`.\n\nTo generate a report in version `15-0-0`, the following struct fields should not be set:\n\n- `Vulnerability.Scanner`\n- `Vulnerability.Category`\n- `Vulnerability.CompareKey`\n- `Ref.CompareKey`\n\nAlso, `Report.Version` must be set explicitly when the analyzer generates a version of the report format that's not the default. For instance, if `14.0.4` is still the default, then `Report.Version` must be set in the analyzer when the requested MODEL is `15`.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nAdd image specs to check that when the variable that controls the MODEL is set to `15`:\n- The `version` field of the reports is set to `15.0.0`.\n- The reports validate the Security Report Schema `15-0-0`.\n\nThe existing job integration tests prove that the Gemansium analyzer uses the model `14` by default.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nUpdate the `gemnasium` project:\n\n- Upgrade to the version of `report` that supports both models of the schema. See #368140 \n   - The `convert` package needs to be changed b/c `Vulnerability.Scanner` becomes a pointer.\n- Add a CLI flag that controls the MODEL of the Security Report Schemas.\n   - Add a `Flags` function to `convert`.\n   - Add a CLI flag that controls the MODEL.\n   - Call `convert.Flags()` when setting up the flags of the `run` command. This needs to be done in the `main` package of all three analyzers: gemnasium, gemnasium-maven, and gemnasium-python.\n   - Raise a warning when the selected MODEL isn't supported.\n   - Don't set the following fields of `Vulnerability` when the requested MODEL is `15`: `Confidence`, `Scanner`, and `CompareKey`.\n   - Set `Report.Version` when the requested MODEL doesn't match the default value.\n- Add image specs for when the model is `15`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-18T15:39:17.749Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T13:12:27.399Z","closed_at":"2022-09-16T06:30:20.015Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","SUS::Impacting","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::usability","section::sec","severity::3","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368147","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/368147","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/368147/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/368147/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#368147","relative":"#368147","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#368147"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8409,"epic":{"id":569293,"iid":8409,"title":"Dependency Scanning uses Security Report Schema 15-0-0","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8409","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":111795194,"iid":368145,"project_id":278964,"title":"Checkbox text has period and it should not","description":"1.

Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Because it's not a single source, it can easily jeopardize data integrity and make it very difficult to maintain. So if we wanted to make any changes, we would need to make the adjustments in 3 separate areas, which increases the delivery and engineering time 😖 Versus if all 3 were consolidated and using a shared component, any maintenance or feature addition could be made to a just a singular point. This means we can deliver a feature in a shorter amount of time and with more reliability :thumbsup: \n\n_optional read_: To better understand the problem with the complication of the current architecture and the importance of this issue, here's how the tool dropdown works 🤓:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n## 1️⃣ How the tool dropdown items are populated\n\nThere are 3 dropdowns - Project, Group, and Instance. They populate the dropdown items from different sources 😖\n\n### Instance and Group\n\nThese two views are using the `simple_filter.vue` component. The dropdown items are populated from hard-coded data 😱 ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/dd1e70d3676891025534dc4a1e89ca9383178fe7/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/store/constants.js#L20)).\n\nIt does not support the display of group data (as that's only available in `scanner_filter.vue` which is only being used by the Project view).\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab/my-gitlab/uploads/0a1aab3680e48d3ab1b4604494c2a7b4/image.png)\n\n### Project\n\nIt uses the `scanner_filter.vue` component (which extends from the `simple_filter.vue`). The dropdown items use the \"scanners\" injected from the `data-scanners` passed through in HAML's data attribute. Not GraphQL query.\n\n[Code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/7dfbe472015ab104827c636387fc251313a6af61/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/vulnerability_report_init.js#L44) | Introduced in this MR `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/51696/diffs`\n\nSample data looks like this:\n\n```javascript\ndata-scanners=\"[\n  { id: 151, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"DEPENDENCY_SCANNING\" },\n  { id: 155, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" },\n  { id: 156, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" },\n  { id: 184, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"DEPENDENCY_SCANNING\" },\n  { id: 162, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"API_FUZZING\" },\n  { id: 161, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SECRET_DETECTION\" },\n  { id: 160, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"COVERAGE_FUZZING\" },\n  { id: 157, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" },\n  { id: 158, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" },\n  { id: 153, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"CLUSTER_IMAGE_SCANNING\" },\n  { id: 152, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"CONTAINER_SCANNING\" },\n  { id: 159, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" },\n  { id: 154, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"DAST\" },\n]\"\n```\n\nIt supports the display of group data.

However because the project doesn't use GraphQL to populate the dropdown items, the FE need to do some additional manual work. The FE need to update the `id` to a compatible `scanner_id` format to make the GraphQL request. The scanner ID was introduced in this MR \u003e `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60556`.\n\nHere's the data coming from HAML where we're utilizing the `id`:\n\n```\ndata-scanner = [\n  { id: 155, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" }, // 👈\n  { id: 156, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" }, // 👈\n  // ...\n  { id: 157, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" }, // 👈\n  { id: 158, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" }, // 👈\n  // ...\n  { id: 159, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"SAST\" }, // 👈\n  { id: 154, vendor: \"GitLab\", report_type: \"DAST\" },\n];\n```\n\nWhich will then need to convert it to the compatibility `scannerId` \u003e [Code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9b2af2dca725b54412e9d0592371b76336c9f686/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/shared/filters/scanner_filter.vue#L84):\n\n```\nconst scannerIds = [\n  \"gid://gitlab/Vulnerabilities::Scanner/155\",\n  \"gid://gitlab/Vulnerabilities::Scanner/156\",\n  \"gid://gitlab/Vulnerabilities::Scanner/157\",\n  \"gid://gitlab/Vulnerabilities::Scanner/158\",\n  \"gid://gitlab/Vulnerabilities::Scanner/159\",\n]\n```\n\nThis can be resolved if the FE consumes the dropdown data from GraphQL's vulnerability scanner query. No additional data manipulation will be required.\n\n## 🕵️ Finding Verdict\n\nMany of the complications can be completely removed if a shared component is used where we populate the data from a single source with Graphql Query.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## 🌟 Proposal\n\n1. Keep it [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) by consolidating all three scanner tool dropdowns (Project, Group, Instance) to use the same `scanner_filter.vue` component\n2.

how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nUser was deployed  via SCIM but with the wrong email address (Azure related). Owner wants to redeploy the user with the correct email address but they're unable to do do because they cannot delete the SCIM ID via SCIM API. SCIM ID seems to be already deleted on their end because no identities are shown for the user via Admin.\n\nThey get the error:\n\n```\n{\"schemas\":[\"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error\"],\"detail\":\"Could not remove [user] from [group]. User is not a group member.\",\"status\":412}\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com, GitLab Enterprise Edition 15.3.0-pre 0d272cb0dfd\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nAllow SCIM token tied to group that provisioned the SCIM identity to delete it even if user is no longer a member of the group.\n\n## Possible workaround\n\nUse rails console to find the SCIM identity, then destroy it using `.destroy!`.\n\nNote: This will not change anything about the state of the user account, such as memberships, so this acts differently than deprovisioning.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T17:55:17.046Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T12:02:21.550Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T14:07:04.868Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew

Add association via `Member#role_id` (weight: `2`)\n1. enforce that a `Member` can only be associated with `Role` if `access_level` matches (weight: `2`)\n1. enforce `Member#access_level` cannot be changed if associated with a custom role (weight: `2`)\n1. create UI to edit the Role (weight: `5`) / or just API as the description suggests (weight: `3`)\n1. edit `ProjectPolicy`: depending on the feature flag `download_code` should use the existing logic or evaluate it based on the `Role` associated with the user in that group hierarchy (weight: `3`)\n1. evaluate performance (we might want to involve ~\"group::scalability\") and define next steps based on that\n\nThese tasks will allow us to enable us to evaluate performance constraints.

Create the registry table `wiki_repository_registry ` to track replication and verification state for wiki repositories;\n    1. Make the legacy code responsible for replicating/verifying wikis to maintain both wiki tables `project_registry` and `wiki_repository_registry` simultaneously until %16.0 behind a feature flag `geo_project_wikis_ssf_migration`;\n    1. Change the metrics gathering implementation to support both tables behind a feature flag `geo_project_wikis_ssf_migration`;\n    1. Enable the `geo_project_wikis_ssf_migration` feature flag;\n\n\n1. [Migrate wikis replication/verification to use SSF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367925)\n    1. Make the SSF code responsible to verify wikis to maintain both wiki tables `project_repository_state` and `wiki_repository_state` simultaneously until %16.0 behind a feature flag `geo_project_wikis_ssf_migration`;\n    1. Make the SSF code responsible for replicating/verifying wikis to maintain both wiki tables `project_registry` and `wiki_repository_registry ` simultaneously until %16.0 behind a feature flag `geo_project_wikis_ssf_migration`; \n\n1. [Migrate projects replication/verification to use SSF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367926)\n\n1. Warning about updating to %16.0 if there is any remaining unmigrated data\n    1. Create a rake task to check if there is any remaining unmigrated data;\n    1. Create a rake task to migrate any remaining unmigrated data;\n    1. Update the [version-specific upgrade docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/version_specific_upgrades.html), to tell customers to check if there is any remaining unmigrated data or run the rake task to migrate the data, otherwise, unmigrated wikis will be resynced after upgrade to version %16.0;\n\n1. Remove projects and wikis migration code in %16.1\n    1. Remove the feature flag `geo_project_wikis_ssf_migration`;\n    1. Remove wiki columns in the `project_repository_state` table; \n    1.

They also mentioned that in this case they don't know what has been migrated or not.\n\nBelow are some details from the customer:\n\n- general group info: 2 epics, 22 issues\n- their group structure.

For this we need to do the followin: \n\n1. Add `source_id` column to `bulk_import_entities` table\n2. Update group \u0026 project pipelines that fetch initial entity information to store `source_id` in the newly added column (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367915#note_1085195344 for details)\n3.

To achieve this one of our goals is to make Value Stream Analytics (VSA) the single source of truth (SSOT) for DevOps Analytics and to allow users to aggregate multiple data records into one VSA.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCustomers that are using Jira for issue management and GitLab for CI\\CD need single source of insight about what's happening within the entire software delivery lifecycle. \n\n### Assumption \n\n1. [GitLab SaaS first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#saas-first) with [Atlassian cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/why-cloud). \n1. PostgreSQL is a blocker for this integration, and a new datastore is needed - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367178+ \n1. Authentication and authorization will be done with API token. \n2. No support for \"mixed\" stages - start and stop events on API-based stages can be from the API. \n3. No bidirectional integration - data flow is Jira--\u003e GL only. VSA will only visualize the Jira data.\n4. Data refresh will be in `near real-time` - updates every 15m.\n4. VSA-Jira integration needs to be compatible with other GitLab-Jira integrations.\n5. Group-level only.\n6. About VSA DORA - we will start with only \"Deployment Frequency\" and \"Lead Time for Changes\".\n7. \"Tasks by Type\" chart is out of scope. \n\n\n\n### Reference use cases \n\n1. Basic flow for [custom VSA stages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/value_stream_analytics.html#stage) base on [Jira events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342780#note_1018483527).\n:\n\n   * Task\\issue create in JIRA\n   * Branch created in GL\n   * Merge request is merged in GL\n   * Task\\issue closed in JIRA\n\n2. Common flow - TBD\n3. Advanced flow - TBD \n\n### Research Goals\n\n\n1. Outline a possible POC architecture, major steps, and effort estimation for POC the basic flow.\n3. Summarize the main gaps in delivering this integration for customers.\n\n### Investigation and clarification questions:\n\n\n1. Is it possible to use some of the existing [Jira integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/) technical design?\n\n\n- Can we mapped the events using the [Import Jira tool](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/jira.html#import-jira-issues-to-gitlab)?\n- In the Jira-based stages can we have a link to [view Jira issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/issues.html#view-jira-issues) for deep-dive stage performance investigation? \n\n3. Any other tools from Ecosystem:Integrations](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ecosystem/integrations/) group that can be relevant to solving this problem?\n2. Can we add filtering to the API? `group`, `project`, `label`, `milestone`?\n5. What enhancements need to be done for the [VSA stage event schema](https://www.figma.com/file/rZ6ZHRCXRxy0Wb83FECK5q/VSA-API---conceptual-model?node-id=3396%3A634)?\n6.

`GraphqlController#execute: getCiConfigData and getPipeline`.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-07-14_at_10.29.17_AM](/uploads/d18d8cc9b7ea276afab510aa06d0aeb2/Screen_Shot_2022-07-14_at_10.29.17_AM.png)\n\nAs a result, it has created an unhealthy error budget in the last 7 days:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-07-14_at_10.33.03_AM](/uploads/8061c26d2e96b066d73c073fd50db3a0/Screen_Shot_2022-07-14_at_10.33.03_AM.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\nIn order for the error budget to return to a healthier state, before we can fix the slow requests, we need to add better logging in `config_compose` and `config_mapper_process` to better understand what is contributing to the slower behavior which will then help with knowing how to improve performance.\n\nBased on the noted provided [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349968#note_846096732):\n\n* `yaml_process_duration_s` = `config_compose_duration_s` + `config_expand_duration_s` + other processes\n* `config_expand_duration_s` = `config_external_process_duration_s` + other processes\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-02-17_at_12.39.16](/uploads/e7a161046d13eaf42e8ec6a30b87d504/Screen_Shot_2022-02-17_at_12.39.16.png)\n\n* Most of the time is spent on `config_compose` and `config_expand`.\n* We don't know much about internal durations of `config_compose`.\n* Most of the time in `config_expand` is spent in `config_external_process`.\n* Most of the time in `config_external_process `is spent in `config_mapper_process`.\n\n## Prioritization Table\n\n\u003c!--\n_NOTE: If the issue is not part of an epic, the implementation table can be removed.

discussion in the investigation [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332892#note_1010425935), we are going to expose a mergability_status attribute that the front end can use to determine if it is mergeable or not.\n\nCurrently, the frontend uses a number of different attributes, and checks to see if and why not the MR is mergable, but consolidating this into one attribute in the backend, we can reduce the complexity and dependency between the Front and Back ends.\n\nThe backend currently does the following checks:\n\nCE + EE:\n\n```\n      ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckOpenStatusService,\n      ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckDraftStatusService,\n      ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckBrokenStatusService,\n      ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckDiscussionsStatusService,\n      ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckCiStatusService\n```\n\nEE only:\n```\n        ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckApprovedService,\n        ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckDeniedPoliciesService,\n        ::MergeRequests::Mergeability::CheckBlockedByOtherMrsService\n```\n\nThe functionality of this new attribute should be behind a feature flag in regard to performance related issues.\n\n**Backend implementation:**\n\nWe have two checks that check mergability, `mergeable` and `mergeable_state`, the first will run the     `MergeRequests::MergeabilityCheckService.new(self)` service + the `mergeable_state` method.\n\nThe `MergeabilityCheckService` checks from a 'git' point of view. It appears the current way we implement it is to run this service (if needed), and return a 'checking' status until it is completed (changed state). \n\nTo do this, we would need to handle the 'checking' case as well, and then after checking run the `mergeable_state` checks to see if there is anything stopping a merge.\n\nThe current checks, currently do not have a 'error' message associated with them, so we will need to implement these for each one, for example, `:failed_ci_check`, `:not_approved` ...\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION

This was done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85108.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com-top-initiatives/free-saas-user-efficiency/free-saas/-/issues/93#note_1026424298, we have now identified that we're missing one event: manifest deletions.\n\nDeleting a manifest on the new registry is a DB cascading operation that will also delete any tags. However, because the tag deletion happens behind the scenes on the DB, there is no tag delete event emitted in this situation. As result, a project's cached registry usage is not updated when a manifest is deleted. This is critical for active repositories (as soon there will be a tag creation/deletion event that will fix the out-of-sync project usage), but if the manifest being deleted is the last one on the repository, there will be no more events for that repository and we're stuck with a non-zero cached project usage on the Rails side forever.\n\n## Solution\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85108/diffs#291d6eaf4f8480001607e173f9402fb4dde7156a_63_77 we skip processing registry events if they don't target a tag. We need to change this. We should also process a delete event when there is no `target.tag` field in the payload, just a `target.digest`.\n\nSample manifest delete event payload:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"events\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"fe702f5b-4e46-4f82-abd8-f40047930dc2\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2022-07-14T12:18:45.019877+01:00\",\n            \"action\": \"delete\",\n            \"target\": {\n                \"digest\": \"sha256:a777c9c66ba177ccfea23f2a216ff6721e78a662cd17019488c417135299cd89\",\n                \"repository\": \"new/repo\"\n            },\n            \"request\": {\n                \"id\": \"f20013f5-0543-4991-89bf-058c228ceaaf\",\n                \"addr\": \"172.16.123.1:61829\",\n                \"host\": \"172.16.123.1:5000\",\n                \"method\": \"DELETE\",\n                \"useragent\": \"HTTPie/3.2.1\"\n            },\n            \"actor\": {},\n            \"source\": {\n                \"addr\": \"Joaos-MBP-GitLab.local:5000\",\n                \"instanceID\": \"d063c416-d185-456f-8fd3-e94d13fed32c\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-14T11:30:41.001Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T01:01:16.983Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T08:08:10.674Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["Unplanned","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","devops::fulfillment","feature::addition","group::utilization","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367862","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/367862","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/367862/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/367862/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#367862","relative":"#367862","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#367862"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":111635549,"iid":367859,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add `author_id` column to `vulnerability_state_transitions` table","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nIn order to capture the requirement mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365058#note_1025542385 we need to add `author_id` column to `vulnerability_state_transitions` table\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1.

One of the consequences of that is that we are not alerting on project mirroring delay. \n\n### Current state\n\nThe state of mirroring is stored in `project_mirror_data` table in Postgres. `gitlab_exporter` is surfacing this information using a number of SQL queries: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-exporter/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab_exporter/database/row_count.rb#L47 .
