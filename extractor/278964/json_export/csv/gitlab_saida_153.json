If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nFollowing comment https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2351#note_263237910\n\nI think just having gitlab-ci.yml template added for AWS (deploy to EC2, ECS, Fargate) would suffice in the short term. We can even use the tool we suggest in our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/deployment/).\n\nI feel that most customers would like to understand our best practices and documentation around how to best deploy using our product and what's needed to be successful. Adding into AutoDevops functionality would be most awesome, but that may be a different issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nCreate a `gitlab-ci.yml` template for deploying to AWS EC2 using [Using Dpl as deployment tool](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/deployment/)\n\nActions needed to be done\n\n* [ ] Create `gitlab-ci.yml` template\n* [ ] Create documentation on how to use the template \n\nWe can later expand on this and add deploying to  ECS, Fargate.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-03T11:07:23.700Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T23:10:24.838Z","closed_at":"2020-10-21T14:11:56.202Z","closed_by":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"labels":["Alliances - AWS","Category:Continuous Delivery","Deliverable","Release::P1","cicd::active","devops::release","direction","group::release","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"user_notes_count":65,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":1,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201742","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201742","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201742/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201742/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#201742","relative":"#201742","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#201742"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2351,"epic":{"id":16529,"iid":2351,"title":"Streamline AWS Deployments","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2351","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30288864,"iid":201730,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor package details frontend in preparation for upcoming improvements","description":"## Summary\n\nRefactor some of the package ~frontend code in anticipation of more package registries and changing the ~UX to match the new container registry. \n\n## Improvements\n\nThere are two main areas which we can improve:\n\n* Package details `installation` instruction components\n* Preparing for the merge of the list and details views into an SPA structure\n\nMy proposal would be to:\n\n1. Convert how the existing package installation instructions are generated from computed props in single components to using `getters` from the Vuex store.\n\t* This could be a single MR where we move the logic from the computed props to the `getters`, then update the existing components to use these getters (with new tests).\n2. Change the implementation of specific installation components for each package type to a generic one that uses the store.\n\t* This will also be a single MR to remove the existing `installation` components and convert to a single component.\n3. Do the same for the `information` component and generate the package info from the store.\n\t* This is a single MR too as it's unrelated to the other two, it could be deferred or worked on later (there are some outstanding questions around certain package types metadata).\n\nThe goal of this is to move most of the installation and information logic into the store where it can be shared across different views.\n\nThe next step would be to change the package ~frontend to work like the new container registry using the Vue Router. This means we'll be using one store for both the list and detail views, giving us extra options like showing installation instructions directly on the list page, etc. This work will be a separate issue spread across a number of MR's and any ~UX enhancements will also follow as new issues.\n\n## Risks\n\n* Package installation features may be effected but the risk is very low.\n\n## Involved components\n\n* `ee/app/assets/javascripts/packages/details/components/*.vue`\n* `ee/app/assets/javascripts/packages/details/store/*.js`\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n* Will reduce the amount of code the ~frontend needs\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n* Should reduce the amount of repeated / similar tests for the `installation` components","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-03T09:39:09.749Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T10:16:03.854Z","closed_at":"2020-06-04T10:16:03.810Z","closed_by":{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick

This means the pipeline result is based on the latest `master` even though the feature branch is behind some commits.\n  - Forked pipeline workflow can follow the current workflow of merging.\n  - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25449 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/41397\n- [x] Ask current maintainers for feedback (tentative date: 2020-02-24) \n- [x] Communicate broadly (tentative date: 2020-02-26):\n  - [x] Company call\n  - [x] Eng. week-in-review\n  - [x] Slack: `#development`, `#backend`, `#frontend`, `#quality`, `#backend_maintainers`, `#frontend_maintainers`, `#ux_maintainers`\n- [x] Enable \"Merge pipelines will try to validate the post-merge result prior to merging\" (Settings \u003e General \u003e Merge Request) (tentative date: 2020-02-27)\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Authors won't have to rebase their branch as frequently anymore (basically, only when there are conflicts) since the Merge Results pipeline will already incorporate the latest changes from `master`. This should result in faster review/merge cycles since maintainers won't have to ask for a final rebase: instead, they'll only have to start a MR pipeline and set MWPS.\n- This step should bring us very close to the actual Merge Trains feature by testing the Merge Results against the latest `master` at the time of the pipeline creation.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Starting a MR pipeline before merging will increase the review/merge cycle time by a pipeline's duration.\n- This will result in more Git refs (the merge refs) and more pipelines.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Will this prevent merging if `master` is currently broken?\n  - If maintainers start a MR pipeline + MWPS, yes it should prevent any merges into `master` until `master` is fixed (although, we don't enforce green pipelines as a condition to be able to merge (this is tracked at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/326).\n- Will this feature prevent a merge if the pipeline is has a transient/flaky failure?\n  - Yes, but the problem can already occurs currently, and retrying the failing job usually solves it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-31T16:39:04.505Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T20:46:32.154Z","closed_at":"2020-02-27T10:05:37.468Z","closed_by":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy

We should be able to display these errors in the upstream bridge job.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_15.07.38](/uploads/ae6f82782d8284b948c96f473cc4daa3/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_15.07.38.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe can reach failure reasons of downstream pipelines via `Ci::Bridge#sourced_pipelines`.\n\nHowever, we don't always create downstream pipelines. Examples:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/12-9-stable-ee/app/services/ci/create_cross_project_pipeline_service.rb#L52\n\nAfter implementing #213666, in this issue, we need store failure reason information of downstream pipelines in bridges. (More discussions about it: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28120#note_312091893)\n\nThen we can have this behavior:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-03-26_at_17.49.17](/uploads/61a993c569ffe152bda5dd15c5393764/Screen_Shot_2020-03-26_at_17.49.17.png)\n\n---\n\nWe also need to add failure reason for strategy:depend situations. We may do this in another issue/MR.\n\nDiscussion: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28120#note_318999395\n\n\u003e I would also consider adding `downstream_pipeline_failed` failure reason to a the list of failure reasons supported by `Ci::Bridge`. It seems like a small effort, and might improve the situation here significantly. We probably would need to add this to `self.drop!(...)` in `Ci::Bridge#inherit_status_from_downstream`\n\n---\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOld Proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n1. Persist all pipeline creation errors in `Ci::Pipeline` model. Maybe we can reuse `Ci::Pipeline#yaml_errors` and rename it to `Ci::Pipeline#creation_errors`?\n1. When creating a downstream pipeline we now persist always the association between bridge job and downstream pipeline, so we can always reference the downstream pipeline from the bridge job.\n1. Change `Gitlab::Ci::Status::Build::Failed#failure_reason_message` to append related downstream pipeline errors if `failure_reason_message` is called to display bridge job errors.\n\nWe could look into changing the `failure_reason_message` to append any additional errors from the downstream pipeline.\n\n```ruby\nclass Ci::Status::Build::Failed\n  def failure_reason_message\n    messages = []\n    messages \u003c\u003c self.class.reasons.fetch(subject.failure_reason.to_sym)\n    messages += subject.additional_errors\n    messages.join(', ')\n  end\nend\n\nclass Ci::Bridge\n  def additional_errors\n    return [] unless failure_reason == 'downstream_bridge_pipeline_creation_failed'\n    \n    # this is not performant and queries need to be optimized\n    sourced_pipelines.map do |source_pipeline|\n      source_pipeline.pipeline.yaml_errors\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nclass Ci::Build\n  def additional_errors\n    []\n

downstream pipeline creation errors out (e.g. an invalid YAML config), the relationship between the bridge job and the downstream pipeline is not saved.\n\nThis is because the relation is being added in the `Seed` pipeline chain step and the chain is broken in `Confing::Content` or `Config::Process` which comes before `Seed`.\n\nThis is required for displaying the downstream creation errors in upstream bridges.\n```\n\nThis was resolved with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/207234\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Use cases to solve\n\n-

For one of our projects, on certain merge requests, the merge request diff is returning 500 Internal Server Error.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n*  Modify large files, in our case `.properties` files with `~9000 lines` encoded using `ISO-8859-1` or `UTF-8`.\r\n*  Create merge request involving those files with several other files.\r\n*  Consult the merge request and try to access the changes

*bug* behavior?\r\n\r\nAs shown in the screenshots the merge request diffs does not show, so we cannot review the code.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\r\n\r\nThe diff changes

Evaluation: Bring your own Vault Integration","description":"### Problem to solve \nIn the large vision for HashiCorp Vault we want to provide users access to Vault as a part of their GitLab experience natively - for both GitLab.com and self-managed instances. As a long term implementation we are evaluating and refining requirements on two main issues: \n\n1) [Bundling Vault with Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/4317) - this would allow users with Self-managed instances to have an integrated Vault with their GitLab Instance \n2) [Provide a single instance for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/28584) - this would allow all users on GitLab.com to have a Vault instance with their GitLab account \n\nWe have a lot of different directions and ways to support users in their journey to use Vault for Secrets Management with GitLab. \n\nAs far as priorities go they are in this order: \n1) Support existing GitLab + Vault Users - \"Bring your own Vault\" (BYOV) \n2) Use Vault for Internal GitLab.com Secrets and Token \n3) Use Vault for Customers of GitLab.com Secrets Management Needs \n4) Support New Installations of Vault with Self-Managed Instances \n\nWe will use this issue to establish the best path forward to support users with existing Vaults in the immediate term (use case 1). \n\n### Further details\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/118624, we are evaluating the handling of secrets and tokens with the GitLab application. This can be the foundation for supporting use cases 2, 3, and 4. For some of our existing customers, their set up (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/28321#note_269481081) they do not want to have to use GitLab to store, administer, or update secrets - they want to defer all of this to Vault. As a result, we should investigate the most flexible way to support GitLab receiving tokens from Vault easily. \n\nThis has been presented in two issues:\n  A) [Identity API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/24123) - where an API would identify which project/job a given Job Token belongs to (and is valid), then redirect users if token it not valid from the CLI \n\n  B) [Allow a user to set up Vault in K8](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/9982) - this would use the Vault Helm chart to install Vault but all configuration and managing of secrets would still be on the User and would likely require implementation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/118624 to manage token/key/secrets passing \n\n\n### Next actions \n\n* [x] Get familiar with HashiCorp Vault and understand the issues link here\n* [ ] Evaluate the easiest/quickest path to better support GitLab users that have a Vault with GitLab \n* [ ] Create or update issues for implementation, add weights and close this issue","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-30T14:11:56.981Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T12:27:22.168Z","closed_at":"2020-04-21T16:17:46.645Z","closed_by":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie Porter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4905402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jreporter"},"labels":["Category:Release Evidence","Category:Secrets Management","Release::P1","UX","backend","cicd::active","devops::release","frontend"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"}],"author":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie Porter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4905402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jreporter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199737","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":1},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199737","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199737/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199737/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#199737","relative":"#199737","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#199737"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30116560,"iid":199736,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove `pipeline.any_report_artifact_for_type` method","description":"`any_report_artifact_for_type` is used exclusively in [Pipeline Presenter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/presenters/ee/ci/pipeline_presenter.rb#L22) \n\nThe pipeline has an alternative method to fetch reports [`batch_lookup_report_artifact_for_file_type`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/2a15e2380a687555c7b6ae0623912a1c44ba6a0e/ee/app/models/ee/ci/pipeline.rb#L107)\n\nWe should use it since:\n1.

Without this visibility, it is difficult to custom tune Cilium rules as there is no easy way to verify that the rule is working as designed.  The current alternative of SSH'ing into each container to view the logs is inefficient for customers with lots of environments or containers, and provides the information in a format that is difficult to quickly interpret.  Ultimately, customers need an easy way to determine whether or not the Cilium rules are functioning as designed and to determine what attacks are occurring against the customer's application.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later. --\u003e\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n\u003c!-- Personas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nNote: some customers may choose to send the logs to a central logging solution before forwarding them on to a SIEM. The solution needs to work for this use case as well\n\nAssumption: Nearly all GitLab Ultimate users are running a SIEM\n\nAssumption: The customer will be responsible for ensuring a networking route exists between the SIEM and the deployed environment\n\n* Users will be able to configure and save global settings to have Cilium logs exported to a SIEM or Central Logging Solution\n* Global settings will be configured on the Settings -\u003e Integration page and will include the following:\n   * IP address or hostname\n   * Port\n   * Protocol (UDP or TCP)\n* The format will be JSON format, will be sent via Syslog protocol, and will not be customizable\n* The JSON will be sent on one line per message\n* Global settings will be applied for all environments where Cilium is deployed\n* Changes to global settings will be pushed to any environments where Cilium is already running\n* Syslog messages will be sent from the K8 cluster directly to the specified IP address\n\n### Designs\n\n![SIEM1](/uploads/e39e5b5ddce2922c131449f165208642/SIEM1.png)\n\n![SIEM3](/uploads/82fa61147ad2dedd07d833f46b1e6734/SIEM3.png)\n\n### Not Required Functionality\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\nFunctionality that is planned for the future but is **not** required to meet the requirements of this issue include the following:\n* The ability to view the logs directly in GitLab will not be considered at this point\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\nPermissions should be consistent with the GitLab permission model\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\nDocumentation for Container Network Security does need to be updated to describe how to configure CNS SIEM settings\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? \n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\nThe following tests will be performed as appropriate:\n* Unit tests\n* End-to-end tests\n* Test with at least one SIEM (Note: Sending via Syslog will make us compatible with 99% of the SIEMs, so testing with just one to confirm connectivity will be adequate)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\nSuccess Criteria:\n* Users are able to view their Cilium logs in a SIEM\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n* Latency from the time a log is generated to when it is sent to the SIEM is not greater than one minute\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-29T22:01:45.492Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T11:46:12.444Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T16:52:56.815Z","closed_by":{"id":4906322,"username":"zmartins","name":"Zamir Martins","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zmartins"},"labels":["Category:Container Network Security","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","Technical Writing","UX","backend-weight::1","devops::govern","direction","documentation","frontend-weight::1","group::security policies","missed-deliverable","missed:12.10","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},{"id":4906322,"username":"zmartins","name":"Zamir Martins","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zmartins"},{"id":4946308,"username":"ngaskill","name":"Nick Gaskill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4946308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ngaskill"},{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"}],"author":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-05-08","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199666","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199666","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199666/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199666/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#199666","relative":"#199666","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#199666"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2108,"epic":{"id":14369,"iid":2108,"title":"Container Network Security - Minimal to Viable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2108","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 22, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30084215,"iid":199587,"project_id":278964,"title":"New SCIM users not created with group SAML connection","description":"### Summary\n\nUsers not previously sync'ed are being created in GitLab.com but without a SAML link to the group, unverified, and without terms of use accepted.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn Azure AD, \n\n1.

The API endpoint will then be consumed by the ~frontend on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33743.\n\nGiven there could be a number of different jobs that would run code coverage in a project, we will have to split this into 2 endpoints:\n\n1. For fetching all the available job names for the past 3 months. The values returned here will be rendered in the dropdown.\n2. For fetching the coverage values for the past 3 months for the given job name.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

understand that release and know what to expect regarding the evidence collection, which is not present in historical releases.\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers would be able to identify when a Release is created with a date in the past through a label and timestamp in the UI.\n\n#### Problem overview\n\nWhen a Release is created with a future `released_at` attribute, it is identified as an **Upcoming Release** ([see documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#upcoming-releases)). This affects the creation of Evidence: with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/38103, Evidence creation is scheduled for the `released_at` timestamp, rather than when the Release object was created.\n\nThere is also the concept of **historical releases**, when a Release is created with a date in the past. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/38103 no Evidence is created for these Releases, as it is not easily known which milestones and issues were present at this historical data.\n\nWithin the Release model, a helper method identifies historical Releases. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### UX DoD (Definition of Done)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to see the UX DoD (Definition of Done) tasks 🔽\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n#### Entry Criteria for Design\n\n- [ ] Problem has been validated\n- [ ] Has UX effort accounted for in long term cycle, _we know unknowns_\n\n#### Criteria for UX DoD\n\n- [x] ~UX label is added to the issue\n- [x] User stories and acceptance criteria have been created\n  - [ ] Edge cases were considered\n- [ ] Cross-team dependencies have been identified, if applicable\n- [ ] Prototype or mock for each user story have been created\n  - [ ] Empty states\n  - [ ] Responsiveness\n- [x] If changes involve copy, ~\"UI text\" label has been added\n- [x] Pajamas: UI Component design have been identified\n  - [ ] Pajamas issue is created (new workflow)\n- [x] Marked as Ready for engineering evaluation per user story moved into ~\"workflow::planning breakdown\" \u0026 ~\"needs weight\" \n\n#### Entry Criteria for Ready for Development\n\n- [ ] Scope has been defined and reviewed with engineering\n- [ ] User stories have been weighed and are less than **5 MRs**\n- [ ] Create new issues for follow up user stories\n\n#### Criteria for Engineering DOD ([in addition to defined process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done)) \n\n- [ ] UX review for MRs that include user experience changes - mandatory for ~frontend that has impact to UI/UX\n- [ ] Update SSOT in issues:\n   - [ ] Update prototypes of deliverables\n   - [ ] Add link to documentation\n- [ ] Create new issues for follow up and open scope\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n* In the API, a release can be created with the `released_at` attribute in the past (as in, prior to the date in the user's local environment/GitLab instance).\n* If a past `released_at` is used, no Evidence is collected for the Release ([see documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#schedule-release-evidence-collection)).\n* When the `released_at` attribute is set in a past date, and the release is created/updated, the release item in the UI should display a badge component next to the release title.\n  * The label should read: `Historical release`\n  * A tooltip should be displayed on hover: `This release was created with a date in the past. Evidence collection at the moment of the release is unavailable.`\n  * ~frontend use the Neutral color (gray) for the badge.\n  * ~frontend verify the possibility to use the [gitlab-ui Badge component](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-badge--default)\n  * ~frontend \u0026 ~UX should comply with the [Pajamas Badge Guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/components/badge/)\n* The release timestamp in the UI should read: `Created \u003ctimestamp\u003e ago by`, followed by the user avatar. Hovering the copy should display a detailed timestamp.\n  * ~frontend make an update to the ~\"UI text\" \n* Ordering of release items in the overview page. Releases should be displayed following the **most recent** to **older** order in the Releases overview page, ordered by the `released_at` attribute. For example:\n\n```\n- v5.1 feb 2020 (Upcoming release)\n- v5.0 jan 2020\n- v4.0 dec 2019\n- v3.0 nov 2019 (Historical release)\n- v2.0 oct 2019\n- ...\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

invite doesn't give expected permission level","description":"### Summary\n\nIf a group is invited as members to other group using \"Invite group\" and a \"Max access level\" is given, it is not taken into account as expected. If a user on the group invited is \"Maintainer\" and \"Max access level\" has been set as \"Reporter\", that user still has \"Maintainer\" permission level on that new group to where his group has been invited.\n\nAlso, if user on group invited is \"Reporter\", and \"Max access level\" has been set as \"Developer\", the user is promoted to developer on this group. This is inconsistent.\n\nSide note: There's no documentation on \"Max access level\" for \"Invite group\".\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a groupA with members and invite a userA as member.\n2. Set user permission level to \"Maintainer\".\n3. Create another groupB.\n4. Use \"Invite group\" and invite groupA to this group.\n5. Set \"Max access level\" to \"Reporter\".\n6. Log with the userA account.\n7. Check that you actually have \"Maintainer\" permissions on the groupB.\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis is an example of a group. It has another group invited as members, with \"Max access level\" set to \"Reporter\".\nhttps://gitlab.com/testing-group-invite2\n\nUser @kryword should have no maintainer access to projects in testing-group-invite2, but it has. It should be limited to Reporter.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPermission level set for members of invited group is the ***less*** restrictive between \"Max access level\" and the permissions of the user on the group invited.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPermission level set for members of invited group should be the ***most*** restrictive between \"Max access level\" and the permissions of the user on the group invited\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nSwap current behaviour to use the most restrictive permission level between \"Max access level\" and the permission of the user on the group invited, instead of using the less restrictive.\n\nAlso document \"Max access level\" on the wiki.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-29T09:09:40.750Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T20:06:09.123Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T21:21:24.283Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","inbound-slack","oncall","page-security","priority::2","security","severity::2","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"}],"author":{"id":4984575,"username":"cristian.berner","name":"Cristian Berner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4984575/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cristian.berner"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-04-05","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199415","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199415","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199415/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199415/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#199415","relative":"#199415","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#199415"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30052391,"iid":199388,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project integrations inherit instance level settings by default","description":"We are implementing https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2430 to transition Service Templates to an inheritable instance-level configuration as part of the [mass-integration epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2137).\n\nThis is an iteration that will enable us to eventually accomplish the next goal of group-level integration settings from which projects can inherit by default.  \n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/196525 defines the UI work for moving Service Templates into Integration settings in the Admin Area.

Modifying the service template does not modify the service/integration settings for the new project.\n\n**Desired Behavior (Instance-Level Integration):** When the instance-level integration is enabled, we do not create a new service record when a new project is created, and the project inherits the instance-level settings. A user can deactivate the integration at the project level or override the inheritance by entering custom values. This triggers the creation of a project-specific service record to override the instance-level settings.\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-29T02:54:50.038Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T20:10:37.528Z","closed_at":"2020-05-20T17:12:48.326Z","closed_by":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","customer","devops::manage","direction","group::ecosystem [DEPRECATED]","missed:12.10","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"}],"author":{"id":4554077,"username":"nhxnguyen","name":"Nick Nguyen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554077/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nhxnguyen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199388","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199388","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199388/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199388/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#199388","relative":"#199388","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#199388"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2430,"epic":{"id":17736,"iid":2430,"title":"Integrations: Instance-level and project-level configuration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2430","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30050115,"iid":199380,"project_id":278964,"title":"Correctly wrap cycle analytics features at mobile viewports","description":"### Summary\nFrom [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35823#note_241386689), at viewports between 768px and 996px the filters don't wrap correctly\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Exporting the logs out to a customer's SIEM is the cheapest and fastest path to making the logs available and visible to our customers.  For that reason, the proposed implementation of this feature has shifted to focus on building UI that will allow for easy export of logs out to an external SIEM.  At some future point in time, we can revisit a path to also make the logs visible in GitLab, as the two are not mutually exclusive.\n\nNote: some customers may choose to send the logs to a central logging solution before forwarding them on to a SIEM.  The solution needs to work for this use case as well\n\nAssumption: Nearly all GitLab Ultimate users are running a SIEM\n\nAssumption: The customer will be responsible for ensuring a networking route exists between the SIEM and the deployed environment\n\n* Users will be able to configure and save global settings to have WAF logs exported to a SIEM or Central Logging Solution\n* Global settings will be configured on the Settings -\u003e Integration page and will include the following:\n   * IP address or hostname\n   * Port\n   * Protocol (UDP or TCP)\n* The format will be JSON format, will be sent via Syslog protocol, and will not be customizable\n* The JSON will be sent on one line per message\n* Global settings will be applied for all environments where WAF is deployed\n* Changes to global settings will be pushed to any environments where WAF is already running\n* Syslog messages will be sent from the K8 cluster directly to the specified IP address\n\n### Designs\n\n![SIEM1](/uploads/e39e5b5ddce2922c131449f165208642/SIEM1.png)\n\n![SIEM3](/uploads/82fa61147ad2dedd07d833f46b1e6734/SIEM3.png)\n\n### Not Required Functionality\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\nFunctionality that is planned for the future but is **not** required to meet the requirements of this issue include the following:\n* The ability to view the logs directly in GitLab will not be considered at this point\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\nPermissions should be consistent with the GitLab permission model\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\nDocumentation for WAF does need to be updated to describe how to configure WAF SIEM settings\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? \n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\nThe following tests will be performed as appropriate:\n* Unit tests\n* End-to-end tests\n* Test with at least one SIEM (Note: Sending via Syslog will make us compatible with 99% of the SIEMs, so testing with just one to confirm connectivity will be adequate)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\nSuccess Criteria:\n* Users are able to view the logs for their WAF in a SIEM\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n* Latency from the time a log is generated to when it is sent to the SIEM is not greater than one minute\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Technical Discovery\n\nIn case there is a need to create a new table (to save the information of the target host), it should have a reference [cluster table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/db/structure.sql#L1573).\n\nThe information save in the DB could used in order to add a second host into [ELK custom values](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/vendor/elastic_stack/values.yaml#L25). [Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuring-output.html) is not very clear if this is an elastic search host only or any host. Otherwise we could look into integrating a syslog solution for supporting a wider number of hosts.\n\nA reinstallation of ELK might be required (`helm update --install`) or an update of the configmap `values-content-configuration-elastic-stack`.\n\n\n### Links /

Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Convert the `:release` yaml to a `releaser-cli` command line\n- Expose Release steps via the API\n\n#### Convert the `:release` yaml to a `releaser-cli` command line\n\nIn it's current form, the `releaser-cli` understands yaml in this form (under the `:release` node):\n\n```yaml\nrelease_job: {\n  stage: 'release',\n  only: 'tags',\n  script: ['make changelog | tee release_changelog.txt'],\n  release: {\n     name: 'Release $CI_COMMIT_SHA',\n     description: 'Created using the release-cli $EXTRA_DESCRIPTION',\n     tag_name: 'release-$CI_COMMIT_SHA',\n     ref: '$CI_COMMIT_SHA'\n  }\n```\n\nThis produces the following command line:\n\n```bash\nrelease-cli create --name \"Release $CI_COMMIT_SHA\" --description \"Created using the release-cli $EXTRA_DESCRIPTION\" --tag-name \"release-$CI_COMMIT_SHA\" --ref \"$CI_COMMIT_SHA\"\n```\n\nThis issue does not cover the extended yaml for binary assets (not currently supported by the `releaser-cli`).\n\n\n#### Expose Release steps via the API\n\nCurrently the API exposes only the `script` and `after_script` steps, i.e. it is possible to called the `releaser-cli` like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"steps\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"script\",\n            \"script\": [\n                \"job script\",\n                \"release-cli create --name \\\"Release $CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --description \\\"Created using the release-cli $EXTRA_DESCRIPTION\\\" --tag-name \\\"release-$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --ref \\\"$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\"\"\n            ] \n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nGoing forward we can name the steps, in this the step would be named `release`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"steps\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"script\",\n            \"script\": [...] \n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"release\",\n            \"script\": [\n                \"release-cli create --name \\\"Release $CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --description \\\"Created using the release-cli $EXTRA_DESCRIPTION\\\" --tag-name \\\"release-$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\" --ref \\\"$CI_COMMIT_SHA\\\"\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nExisting permissions apply - access is via

It appears though we've release child/parent pipelines only behind the trigger keyword, with no actual (or at least documented) way to trigger them, exacerbating this continued split.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the trigger keyword on a free CE project. See that it does not work (no `trigger` keyword is available). Try again on EE project at free tier and see it work.\n\n### Example Project\n\nTBD\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`trigger` keyword is unavailable.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`trigger` keyword is available.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nN/A\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on gitlab.com.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nAt this point I believe it's best to make the `trigger` keyword available in core. We have a stewardship promise to not move features up, and anyway this is only providing a very small bit of value but giving an option to use a native keyword instead of a `curl` to the API. We will continue to differentiate the multi-project pipelines feature through dashboards and multi-project views rather than preventing ease of use in the .gitlab-ci.yml.\n\nDocumentation will need to be updated as it relates to the `trigger` keyword.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-28T10:20:13.107Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T10:42:23.461Z","closed_at":"2020-02-20T12:11:56.467Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","documentation","group::pipeline execution","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":2243533,"username":"jyavorska","name":"Jason Yavorska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2243533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jyavorska"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":12,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199224","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199224","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199224/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/199224/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#199224","relative":"#199224","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#199224"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30011704,"iid":199221,"project_id":278964,"title":"Step 4: Version Control for Snippets: Update API to adapt it to snippet repositories (MVP)","description":"**Important:** All the new functionality must be implemented behind the feature flag `:version_snippets`.

Each device the test runs on produces a junit_result.xml file. This results in the following quirk in displaying the test results:\n\u003e\n\u003e When a test succeeds on all devices, it is listed in the results view *exactly once*. If the test fails on 4 devices, but succeeds on 3 devices, the test is listed as failing 4 times, and succeeding one time.\n\u003e\n\u003e We thought to work around this by setting the suite name of each of the resulting files to the device characteristics, but it seems like the suite name is ignored by GitLab, and so this was unsuccessful.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Change `Jobs` to `Tests` in the text under Summary\n* Relabel 'Test Suites' to 'Job' to better reflect where the data is from\n* In the detail view change out `classname` to `suite` to better reflect the test being run\n* ~~In the detail view add a toggle to sort the tests in the order ran OR sort failed tests first.~~ - instead the [failed tests will be shown by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217514) and have an option to show all tests.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNone.\n\n### Documentation\n\nNone.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n* Changes detailed are made, UX

The first potential problem is: the Job fails completely due to a system outage, and the job request is lost from Redis. This should be a low chance of this happening, as while Redis is a in-memory DB, a snapshot is written to disk and restored after a crash.\n\nThe second problem is it is not possible to control when a Sidekiq job will run. Even when the job is queued immediately, it is possible that something changes in the Evidence before the job was run, eg: a new Issue is added.\n\nMaking jobs 100% reliable is a much larger problem that will likely require tracking calls to Sidekiq and if they succeeded inside Postgres or use [Sidekiq Pro](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Reliability). It's quite possible we don't really need this level of reliability.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nIngress (Probably the best option)\n\n![image](/uploads/743385f40f8832dd4826824ce462557f/image.png)\nIngress is actually NOT a type of service. Instead, it sits in front of multiple services and act as a “smart router” or entrypoint into your cluster.\nYou can do a lot of different things with an Ingress, and there are many types of Ingress controllers that have different capabilities.\nThe default GKE ingress controller will spin up a HTTP(S) Load Balancer for you. This will let you do both path based and subdomain based routing to backend services. For example, you can send everything on foo.yourdomain.com to the foo service, and everything under the yourdomain.com/bar/ path to the bar service.\nThe YAML for a Ingress object on GKE with a L7 HTTP Load Balancer might look like this:\n\n```\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: my-ingress\nspec:\n  backend:\n    serviceName: other\n    servicePort: 8080\n  rules:\n  - host: foo.mydomain.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - backend:\n          serviceName: foo\n          servicePort: 8080\n  - host: mydomain.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /bar/*\n        backend:\n          serviceName: bar\n          servicePort: 8080\n```\n\nLoad Balancer \n\n![image](/uploads/c303a39aeb5584deedec13c73685e7a0/image.png)\n\nThere are two methods supporting in Kubernetes to achieve the load balancer service:\n**Configuration file**\nTo create an external load balancer, add the following line to your service configuration file:\n   ` type: LoadBalancer`\n\nYour configuration file might look like:\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - port: 8765\n      targetPort: 9376\n  type: LoadBalancer\n```\n**Using kubectl**\nYou can alternatively create the service with the kubectl expose command and its --type=LoadBalancer flag:\n\n```\n kubectl expose rc example --port=8765 --target-port=9376 \\\n         --name=example-service --type=LoadBalancer\n```\n\nAnother option may be (less recommended)\nNodePort\nA NodePort service is the most primitive way to get external traffic directly to your service. NodePort, as the name implies, opens a specific port on all the Nodes (the VMs), and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service.\n![image](/uploads/a9539c337060fe09d5aabe4d8a197fea/image.png)\nThe YAML for a NodePort service looks like this:\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:  \n  name: my-nodeport-service\nspec:\n  selector:    \n    app: my-app\n  type: NodePort\n  ports:  \n  - name: http\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 80\n    nodePort: 30036\n    protocol: TCP\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThere are 3 proposed approaches described above, please evaluate these approaches and provide a breakdown of pros and cons for each approach. If possible, also provide a rough estimate of effort involved (S, M, L, XL).\n\nAccording to the recommendations below:\nIngress (and Ingres Controller providers like NGINX, HAproxy) are probably your best bet moving forward. These are native mechanics of K8S, which we should leverage if at all possible.\n\nUnless the consumer has a very good understanding of K8S as a platform, they *absolutely* don't want to be managing LoadBalancers *providers* themselves. Don't get me started on the networking requirements of NodePorts, and exposing VM nodes directly to the internet over random ports, across who knows which platform.\n\n1. An Ingres controller is deployed, providing a Service. This Service is generally of type LoadBalancer or NodePort. Traffic is routed from *outside* the cluster, into that Service by whichever means are deployed.\n1. The controller's Pods that back the Service receive the traffic for all Ingress's serviced by the controller (see `kubernetes.io/ingress.provider`, `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotations)\n1. That Pod then decide the appropriate destination for the traffic, based upon whatever logic the server binary inside makes use of.\n   * In the case of NGINX Ingress, there is a fully rendered `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`\n1. That binary then forwards the traffic, as it deems fit, to the appropriate Services or Pods directly.\n\n*/etc/nginx/nginx.conf* key sections (trimmmed)\n\n```\n        upstream upstream_balancer {\n                server 0.0.0.1; # placeholder\n                balancer_by_lua_block {\n                        balancer.balance()\n                }\n                keepalive 32;\n                keepalive_timeout  60s;\n                keepalive_requests 100;\n        }\n        ## start server gitlab.separate-containers.party\n        server {\n                server_name gitlab.separate-containers.party ;\n                listen 80;\n                set $proxy_upstream_name \"-\";\n                listen 443  ssl ;\n                location /admin/sidekiq {\n                        set $namespace      \"default\";\n                        set $ingress_name   \"demo-unicorn\";\n                        set $service_name   \"demo-unicorn\";\n                        set $service_port   \"8080\";\n                        set $location_path  \"/admin/sidekiq\";\n                        set $proxy_upstream_name \"default-demo-unicorn-8080\";\n                        proxy_pass http://upstream_balancer;\n                }\n                location / {\n                        set $namespace      \"default\";\n                        set $ingress_name   \"demo-unicorn\";\n                        set $service_name   \"demo-unicorn\";\n                        set $service_port   \"8181\";\n                        set $location_path  \"/\";\n                        set $proxy_upstream_name \"default-demo-unicorn-8181\";\n                        proxy_pass http://upstream_balancer;\n                }\n        }\n        # TCP services\n        server {\n                preread_by_lua_block {\n                        ngx.var.proxy_upstream_name=\"tcp-default-demo-gitlab-shell-22\";\n                }\n                listen                  22;\n                proxy_timeout           600s;\n                proxy_pass              upstream_balancer;\n        }\n```\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?
