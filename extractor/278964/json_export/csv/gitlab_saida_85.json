Similar concern applies to old versions that we might not have invested in supporting.\n\nAs a result, it is difficult to identify what is supported and what is not.\n\n### Further details\n\nAny supported language, package manager and file format should be explicitely listed so that we can quickly identify what's a real bug or what is additional feature request to support another version.\n\n### Proposal\n\nExplicitely state the supported versions in the [Supported languages and package managers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#supported-languages-and-package-managers) section of our user documentation.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] iterate through downstream tests in [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) and note current versions of language (if exists in rep) and lockfiles used\n- [ ] iterate through downstream tests in [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) and note java versions supported as well as versions of maven, gradle, sbt\n- [ ] iterate through downstream tests in [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) and note minor python versions used for python 2 and 3, as well as versions of pip, pipenv, setuptools\n- [ ] iterate through downstream tests in [bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit) and note ruby version and bundler version used\n- [ ] iterate through downstream tests in [retire.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js) and note and note npm version used\n- [ ] document

signal danger, or some kind of error or failure.\n\nI've taken a stab at colouring them a random shade of green (GL designers almost certainly have a better palette in mind).\n\nPlease could we look at changing the colour of successful pipelines to be some kind of green, indicating success? The colour green is already used for colour-coding stages and steps in pipelines, so it's reasonable to assume that this is a sensible change.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read through this...\n\n### Before\n\n![Screenshot_2021-02-08_at_13.38.53](/uploads/8631ebba16dd841f8e93a72256c02748/Screenshot_2021-02-08_at_13.38.53.png)\n\n### After\n\n![Screenshot_2021-02-08_at_13.43.01](/uploads/08ce7394ef70aa187ac698b16bdbcfec/Screenshot_2021-02-08_at_13.43.01.png)\n\n------\n\n## Design proposal\nUse `$data-viz-blue-500 #5772ff` for all and `$data-viz-green-700` `#366800` for success","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-08T11:47:42.589Z","updated_at":"2021-07-23T07:32:17.505Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T17:48:17.017Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline execution","pajamas::build","pd::finished","pipeline analytics","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"}],"author":{"id":177680,"username":"gee-forr","name":"Gabriel Fortuna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/25b34262c221944933ed0147a01f3074?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gee-forr"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320748","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/320748","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/320748/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/320748/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#320748","relative":"#320748","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#320748"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78633407,"iid":320746,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update the Package list item UI - Make action buttons in list items secondary","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nThe information hierarchy of the delete buttons in each list item of the Package and Container registries is distracting and makes it difficult for users to easily navigate down the page. \n\n### Proposal \n\nTransition the list view action buttons to be secondary button style. This should mean the button is made of a Red Outline and a Red Icon. The background should be white. \n\n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release post content\n\nWith the maturity of GitLab Secure scanning tools, we've needed to add more granularity into our release process. Prior to this release GitLab shared a major version number for [all our analyzers and tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks). This required all tools to share a major version and prevented the use of [semantic version numbering](https://semver.org/). Beginning in 13.10 GitLab SAST will deprecate the `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG` in our managed SAST.gitlab-ci.yml CI template in favor of `major.minor` tags for each analyzer. \nIf you override or maintain custom versions of `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` you will want to update your CI templates to stop referencing `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG`. We strongly encourage [inheriting and overriding our managed CI templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#overriding-sast-jobs) to future proof your CI templates. This change will allow you to instead override with a pinned `major.minor` version to more granular control future analyzer updates. We will remove `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG` with GitLab 14.0, releasing May 22, 2021. \n\n### Problem to solve \n\nGitLab's Secure scanning tools have continued to mature, necessitating our need to add more granularity into our release process. Prior to this release GitLab shared a major version number for [all analyzers and tools used in SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks). While this approach provides simplicity for customers, it introduces an unintended coupling between analyzer projects. In short, having one variable to declare the version of analyzers to be utilized forces us to keep the analyzer versions synced rather than allowing the analyzers to be versioned naturally according to new features being introduced over time. We need to undo this coupling.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n- [x] Add `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG` as a variable in the `bandit-sast` job.

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-05T18:28:24.949Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T22:38:24.360Z","closed_at":"2021-06-07T14:48:41.211Z","closed_by":{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},"labels":["Deliverable","GitLab Core","backend","deprecation","devops::secure","group::static analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:13.9","release post item","release post item::in review","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"}],"author":{"id":5329074,"username":"tmccaslin","name":"Taylor McCaslin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5329074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmccaslin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/301216","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":21,"completed_count":15},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"15 of 21 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/301216","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/301216/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/301216/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#301216","relative":"#301216","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#301216"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5408,"epic":{"id":205427,"iid":5408,"title":"14.0 removals for Static Analysis","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5408","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78515123,"iid":301215,"project_id":278964,"title":"Deprecating SAST analyzer SAST_GOSEC_CONFIG variable in favor of custom rulesets","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

Reuse existing finder code, so we don't need to duplicate that logic.\n    \u003e - Move everything into `TemplateFinder` class methods, so no more `template_names` methods.\n    \u003e - Handle the special case for issues/MRs with an `uncached: true` param on `all_template_names`, instead of aliasing the method.\n    \u003e - I kept the names `all_template_names` / `all_templates_array` for now, but something like `dropdown_entries` / `dropdown_entries_array` would seem much clearer to me.\n    \u003e   - That one use in the API seems redundant, so I reverted that to use the finder directly.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e WDYT about this approach? It would still need some work, e.g. some of the added specs are now redundant, or should be moved into the specs for `TemplateFinder`.

In most cases the amount of time it takes to load the tabs is considerably longer than loading their search results (eg. issue search may take 1s to load, but notes, blobs, wiki_blobs take 30s to load each). This doesn't seem like a problem on the face of things because they are async loaded after the results are loaded but the problem worsens when the user then performs another search before the tab counts are loaded.\n\nAt this point their new search is now queued behind all the slow tab counts since Elasticsearch limits how many concurrent searches it would perform. And again the problem compounds if they switch tabs or click the next page of results. Every single page load is again queueing up many more count searches which are again ahead of the users main search in Elasticsearch's queue.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe do really want to keep tab counts (discussed a little in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218565) due to the fact that they help the user decide if it's worth clicking on the tab to see results. People don't want to click on a tab and wait ages for results if it turns out the tab is just going to be empty anyway. But this is actually a self-perpetuating problem because the main reason switching tabs is slow is because of the counts loading in the first place. If we get the searches loading faster then the value of tab counts is lowered.\n\nOne main step we can take in the right direction (short of removing the counts per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218565 ) is to just set a timeout on count loads. We can set a 1s timeout and then if they don't load quickly you just won't see the tab count. Based on the Elasticsearch timeout implementation you actually get to see a count but it may be smaller than the full count because it stops counting when it hits the timeout.\n\n## Technical notes\n\nI did some benchmarking which shows that setting a 1s timeout makes a big difference in terms of throughput for loading counts. My testing also showed that you still get results but when it times out the response looks like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"took\": 4393,\n  \"timed_out\": true,\n  \"_shards\": {\n    \"total\": 120,\n    \"successful\": 120,\n    \"skipped\": 0,\n    \"failed\": 0\n  },\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"total\": {\n      \"value\": 10000,\n      \"relation\": \"gte\"\n    },\n    \"max_score\": null,\n    \"hits\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWeirdly though I set the timeout to `1s`, as can be seen in the above response, it often took longer than 1s to timeout, likely due to the async nature of Elasticsearch. Either way it did indeed timeout and did remove the search from the queue quickly thus leading to higher throughput. Furthermore we can see in the above response that we do still get a count in the event of a timeout. That will give us the option to decide if we want to show the partial count to the user (minimal effort) or if we want to detect the timeout and show some indicator to the user that we could not fetch the count.\n\n### Benchmarking\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ebenchmark-timeout.rb\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```rb\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'benchmark'\nrequire 'rest-client'\nrequire

We can configure this in the admin UI too. But we could have a separate client side default for the count queries. I looked into this too as I wanted to ensure that if the client side times out and closes the connection it would additionally be quickly removed from the queue on the server side and thus quickly free up threads. This seemed to work as hoped and setting a client side timeout of 1s will massively improve throughput even further than the server side timeouts. But it will have the tradeoff that we won't get back a partial count. So it depends if we want the partial count or not as to whether we should use the client side timeout.\n\n\n### More examples of queuing causing problems\n\nThere is more evidence that these counts are causing queuing which is causing slow searches in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292439#note_499088147 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292439#note_478042497","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-05T04:02:50.845Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:04:56.315Z","closed_at":"2021-02-16T20:50:49.448Z","closed_by":{"id":4888751,"username":"changzhengliu","name":"Changzheng Liu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4888751/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/changzhengliu"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","SUS::FY22 Q1 - Done","bug::performance","devops::data_stores","group::global search","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/301146","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/301146","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/301146/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/301146/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#301146","relative":"#301146","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#301146"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5240,"epic":{"id":184767,"iid":5240,"title":"Performance Improvements for Elasticsearch Latency","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5240","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78464787,"iid":301142,"project_id":278964,"title":"Replace Namespace#self_and_descendants with linear version","description":"We are now storing the Namespace path from `root_ancestor` to `self` on each Namespace.

Proposal\n\nChange the [Dependency Scanning CI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)\n- to enable the new behavior, and make the scanning job exit with a non-zero exit code when vulnerabilities are found \n- to allow the job failure when vulnerabilities are found\n\nThis is done by changing the definition of `.ds-analyzer` in the CI template:\n- update the `variables`, and set the variable that changes the behavior \n- don't set `allow_failure` to `true`, but instead set [allow_failure:exit_codes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#allow_failureexit_codes) so that it matches the exit code returned when vulnerabilities are found\n\nThe new environment variable that changes the behavior and the new exit codes for when vulnerabilities are found are specified in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324634#environment-variable.\n\nSee experiment in

It is hard to find the most critical issues of those to address, even in the smaller view of the Merge Request Widget.\n\nThe Code Quality Merge Request Widget and the Full Report now sort Code Quality violations by Severity. This allows you to quickly see the most important code quality violations that need addressed in the Merge Request Widget or the project overall in the Full Code Quality report.\n\n### What\n\nIn the merge request widget for **code quality**, there is a lot of item duplication.

This leaves the permissions in an uncertain state, as the unchecked \u0026 dimmed checkbox implies external management but does not apply the ostensible parent setting.\n\nThis is a confusing GUI state since it may not be clear that the group restrictions are not applied when checked at the group level. The checkboxes can only be updated by unchecking the group-level setting, editing the project, then enabling the group setting.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a group\n1. Create a project inside the group\n1. Deselect \"Reject unverified users\" \u0026 \"Reject unsigned commits\" in the project in Project → Settings → Push Rules\n1. Set \"Reject unverified users\" \u0026 \"Reject unsigned commits\" in Push Rules in the parent group\n1.

Remove it from `app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/mixins/pipelines.js`, where its imported as `SvgBlankState`.\n  - This will reduce the size of the Vue mixin a bit\n- Import `GlEmptyState` **locally**

Here are a few points to keep in mind while developing this: \n\n- Ideally, we want to create a new endpoint for this so that this form is easily linkable.\n- This is a big issue. Consider breaking this up into multiple Merge Requests. Just to give an idea, perhaps consider creating a merge request for each of these sections:\n  - Name \u0026 Description\n  - Details\n  - Identifiers\n  - Evidence\n  - Solution\n- When the form is submitted, it should redirect back to the Vulnerability Report page and display a success toaster like designed here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/204818/designs/z04_Confirmation-Toast-in-Vuln-Report.png\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/204818/)\n- [Desired outcome - mock](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/204818/designs/m01_Manual-result_first-run-experience.png)\n- [Location field discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346916#note_774449732)\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated. The plan can also\ncall-out responsibilities for other team members or teams.\n--\u003e\n\nHere is an example API call: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/10272#note_651413684\n\n- [x] Create new page for \"add manual vulnerability\" feature\n- [ ] Implement the form in the design **except** for the `Add evidence` section and its respective button and field (since that is tracked in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333620)\n- [ ] Clicking the Submit button should redirect the user to the vulnerability details page\n- [ ] The Submit button should be enabled at all times. If there are missing required fields when it is clicked, the required fields should be highlighted in red with an error message underneath them, and the page should scroll to the first required field.

But the `project_key` is not unique across projects therefore incorrect project can be found. Afterwards, `valid_project_key?(project, match[:slug])` will return `false` which is correct as incorrect project has been found.\n\nWe should ideally search project by its `full_path`. But we get the path in the `slug` form so it is not that easy.\n\nWe use [`Gitlab::Utils.slugify`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/utils.rb#L80) method for that. With this method, eg. `group/test-one` and `group/test/one` paths will be resulting to the same string `group-test-one`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-03T21:17:42.641Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T00:33:42.754Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T18:09:47.834Z","closed_by":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"labels":["Category:Service Desk","Deliverable","backend","devops::plan","group::respond","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"}],"author":{"id":6158134,"username":"BeowuIf","name":"Beowulf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6158134/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/BeowuIf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"user_notes_count":38,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300964","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300964","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300964/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300964/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300964","relative":"#300964","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300964"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78386927,"iid":300961,"project_id":278964,"title":"Impersonation start/stop audit events not appearing on the group-level page","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAudit Events for \"impersonation start/stop\" are not appearing in the group-level Audit Events page.

However, this field is required. See [JSON schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/v3.0.0/dist/dependency-scanning-report-format.json#L9). We could and should fix the schema to make this field optional, but there's no easy fix because the analyzer generate reports in schema v3.0.0, whereas the latest version of the schemas is v13.0.0.\n- The solution is to upgrade the [report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/) package to make it generate reports that validate v13.0.0, and update the analyzer to use this package, but this is a significant effort.\n- A workaround would be to fix v3.0.0 and publish the fix as v3.0.1, but the schemas would have a broken history (inconsistent changelog). Also, we would have to update the `report` package so that it sets the `version` field to v3.0.1, to match the schema version, and this adds to the work.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTrigger a pipeline in one of the Secure test projects supported by [bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit) or [retire.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js).\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nJSON schema validation fails, in the Dependency Scanning QA job:\n\n```\n'dependency_files' is a required property\n```\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/jobs/1003714231\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nSuccessful schema validation\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- fix: publish a new version of the Dependency Scanning report schema where `dependency_files` optional, update `report` lib to use that new version, update all 5 Dependency Scanning analyzers =\u003e The way to go.\n- fix: ~~make `dependency_files` optional in JSON schemas v3, publish as v3.0.1, update report lib and analyzers to set `version` field of the report to `3.0.1`; this is a workaround since v3 shouldn't changed.~~ All 5 Dependency Scanning analyzers now create reports in version [v14.0.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/v14.0.0/dist/dependency-scanning-report-format.json) of the report format.\n- workaround: change the `compare_report.sh` script in order to set `dependency_files` to an empty JSON array right before schema validation, when this is a DS report; this workaround would be removed after implementing the proper solution\n   - implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/204\n   - ported to image integration tests in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/194\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] drop [src/dependency-scanning-report-format.json#L28](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/v14.0.0/src/dependency-scanning-report-format.json#L28), and publish a new version of the schema where `dependency_files` is optional\n- [ ] update the [analyzers/report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report) package, and bump to the new version of the schema; this is similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/-/merge_requests/4\n- [ ] update all 5 Dependency Scanning analyzers\n   - update the `analyzers/report` in project dependencies\n   - update the `version` of the expected report, in the `qa/expect` directory\n   - publish new version\n- revert existing workarounds\n   - [ ] remove workaround for job integration tests, implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/204\n   - [ ] remove workaround for image integration tests, implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/194\n\n/cc @willmeek @ifrenkel @brytannia","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-03T10:16:43.732Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T08:35:30.641Z","closed_at":"2022-02-14T20:21:34.715Z","closed_by":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","blocked","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::pipelines","priority::4","section::sec","type::maintenance","won't do","wontfix","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300877","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300877","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300877/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/300877/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#300877","relative":"#300877","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#300877"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":78346090,"iid":300874,"project_id":278964,"title":"Change Author to Owner for CICD attributes","description":"### Summary\n\nOn the `/-/settings/ci_cd` page when there are [`Pipeline subscriptions`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/multi_project_pipelines.html#trigger-a-pipeline-when-an-upstream-project-is-rebuilt) controls where you can subscribe to other project pipelines:\n\n![image](/uploads/2bda482a8847da8e9f3b25fad2646bb4/image.png)\n\n\nWhen we are displaying the list of subscriptions we show the project's owner as `Author` and with [`user_avatar_without_link`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f3d7d0630a992553b917680d718af2f1f36395c4/ee/app/views/projects/settings/subscriptions/_project.html.haml#L6) we show an avatar for it.

This is bad because the method name suggests that it's argument is always a User instance and it can be customized with user specific attributes.  \n\n### Proposal\n\nChange `Author` to `Owner` and
