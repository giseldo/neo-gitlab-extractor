longer your `gitlab-ci.yml` scripts are, the more difficult they are to maintain and scale.

The error report came from users. We might have detected the error if we have a specific metric about it.\n\nWhen [implementing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41102) the child-of-child pipelines feature, we introduced [a new failure reason](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41102/diffs#37adba96366d81a4a5295bdbe86b46e1300be01a_29_29) `reached_max_descendant_pipelines_depth: 1009`.\n\nAfter rolling out the feature for some users, the number of jobs that were failed with the reason `1009` increased.\n\nThis issue is opened for \"whether we can improve upon our Grafana dashboards and alerting given that we are aware of the error returned\" section of [the corrective actions issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258217) after discussing it with [Grzegorz](https://gitlab.com/grzesiek).\n\n## Proposal\n\nCurrently, we have [a dashboard in Grafana](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/000000159/ci?orgId=1\u0026viewPanel=82) about job failures. The data is provided by Runner.\n\nSimilarly, we can also add a metric and create a dashboard by providing data from the Rails side where we call `drop` method on jobs.\n\nDummy example;\n\n```ruby\nfailure_reason = :reached_max_descendant_pipelines_depth\n\ncounter = Gitlab::Metrics.counter(:gitlab_ci_job_failures, 'Job failures')\ncounter.increment(reason: failure_reason)\n\n@bridge.drop!(failure_reason)\n```\n\nOf course, having this metric/dashboard is not enough itself. Either we implement an alert mechanism for unusual increases or we check the dashboard when rolling out a feature.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-15T19:10:32.438Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:04:05.312Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T20:09:58.050Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["CI/CD Core Platform","Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Pipeline Authoring","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","missed:13.11","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/283807","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283807","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283807/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/283807/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#283807","relative":"#283807","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#283807"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":74379615,"iid":283314,"project_id":278964,"title":"Upgrade requests library to latest version for API Fuzzing","description":"### Problem\n\nVarious python scripts used by API Fuzzing depend on the `requests` library.

Also, having one (well-named) number to track makes it simples to build dashboards and reports.\n\n## Proposal\n\n* Add a new usage ping metric that combines the individual metrics.\n* This metric will count the number of unique users engaging any importer feature.\n* Name this metric clearly, something like `usage_activity_by_stage.manage.unique_users_all_imports`\n\nThe above-described proposal is technically challenging and will be a larger effort, as it combines the users data for projects, groups, and individual issue importers in order to dedupe them to arrive at unique user counts.\n\nTherefore, we will approach this solution by iterating, as follows:\n1. Create a new usage ping that contains unique user counts for project importers only. This can be done much faster, as we already have a similar solution. - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297431\n1. Compare the count for project importers to the counts of issue and group importers to decide if the added precision warrants the additional investment.\n1. If needed, play this issue to instrument the full user counts. Otherwise, cancel this issue.\n1.

Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/758607/Centralized-SMAU-GMAU-Dashboard) to use the new metric.\n* Clean-up of the current usage pings that contain user counts. -

verify which ones they want\n  - [ ] in the threat monitoring page, we already have tabs, so we would want to use filters instead of the tabs","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-13T17:37:54.682Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:51:16.473Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T16:53:23.776Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"labels":["Category:APM alerts","Category:Container Network Security","GitLab Ultimate","cross-group","devops::monitor","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::security policies","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"},{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"}],"author":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/282515","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 7 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/282515","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/282515/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/282515/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#282515","relative":"#282515","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#282515"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3438,"epic":{"id":60085,"iid":3438,"title":"MVC: Initial Project Level Alert Dashboard","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3438","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 12, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74335925,"iid":282503,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project Import from object storage via API","description":"## Summary\n\nCurrently, the Infrastructure SRE team is frequently asked by Customer Support to run manual exports or imports because they fail due to an enforced size-limit on GitLab.com on http transfers via web and API.

Following the :footprints: iteration value, we will do this via API, the same way we already have in the project export.\n\n## Future considerations\n\nThis issue only adds the import storage credentials to the API.

The reason is that when we specify diff position, the API validation logic incorrectly requires the request to specify both old and new line. But the comment should either be on the old or on the new line.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create an MR with a simple change (I changed one line of code and created an MR from Web IDE https://gitlab.com/viktomas/test-project/-/merge_requests/3/)\n1. Get the version with\n    ```sh\n    curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer TOKEN\" 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/20486274/merge_requests/3/versions' | jq\n    ```\n    \n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"id\": 124417604,\n        \"head_commit_sha\": \"1d0f0059d3a11b8f24d1b2493646e367c7ebe3b6\",\n        \"base_commit_sha\": \"1f0fa02de1f6b913d674a8be10899fb8540237a9\",\n        \"start_commit_sha\": \"1f0fa02de1f6b913d674a8be10899fb8540237a9\",\n        \"created_at\": \"2020-11-13T14:09:41.537Z\",\n        \"merge_request_id\": 77967925,\n        \"state\": \"collected\",\n        \"real_size\": \"1\"\n      }\n    ]\n    ```\n1. Use the triplet of commit_sha to craft a new comment request\n    ```sh\n    curl  --request POST --header \"Authorization: Bearer TOKEN\" --form \"body=Via API\" \\\n    --form \"position[old_path]=test.js\" --form \"position[new_path]=test.js\" \\\n    --form \"position[old_line]=20\" \\\n    --form \"position[head_sha]=1d0f0059d3a11b8f24d1b2493646e367c7ebe3b6\" \\\n    --form \"position[base_sha]=1f0fa02de1f6b913d674a8be10899fb8540237a9\" \\\n    --form \"position[start_sha]=1f0fa02de1f6b913d674a8be10899fb8540237a9\" \\\n    --form \"position[position_type]=text\" \\\n    https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/20486274/merge_requests/3/discussions\n    ```\n1. This **REST API call** correctly creates a comment\n1. Doing the same thing from GraphQL is not possible\n1. Go to https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer\n1. Get the MR ID\n    ```graphql\n    {\n      project(fullPath:\"viktomas/test-project\"){\n        mergeRequest(iid: \"3\"){\n          id\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n1. craft equivalent of the REST API call\n    ```graphql\n    mutation AddComment {\n      createDiffNote(input: {body: \"test\", noteableId: \"gid://gitlab/MergeRequest/77967925\", position: {headSha: \"1d0f0059d3a11b8f24d1b2493646e367c7ebe3b6\", baseSha: \"1f0fa02de1f6b913d674a8be10899fb8540237a9\", startSha: \"1f0fa02de1f6b913d674a8be10899fb8540237a9\", paths: {oldPath: \"test.js\", newPath: \"test.js\"}, oldLine: 20}}) {\n        note {\n          body\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n1. you get an error\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"errors\": [\n        {\n          \"message\": \"Argument 'newLine' on InputObject 'DiffPositionInput' is required. Expected type Int!\",\n          \"locations\": [\n            {\n              \"line\": 2,\n              \"column\": 100\n            }\n          ],\n          \"path\": [\n            \"mutation

Pick an issue and assign yourself if you currently are not assigned.\n1. Preparation:\n   1. Figure out on which pages your CSS is used, note down the HAML files. Note: Sometimes page specific CSS can be used on multiple pages!\n   1. Move the file from `app/assets/stylesheets/pages` to `app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`\n   1. Remove it from `page_specific_files.scss`\n   1. Add the file to `config/application.rb`\n   1. Add `- add_page_specific_style 'page_bundles/example'` to all haml templates you have identified that are using these styles. (available once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43680 lands, in order to drive bias for action you can use `= stylesheet_link_tag 'page_bundles/example'`) for now.\n1. Use CSS variables for all the colors. This is **crucial** for dark mode.\n   1. If a color doesn't have an exact match with [Pajamas colors](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/colors), choose the nearest color from the Pajamas colors. If there isn't an exact match, see whether a dark mode variable is available: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/themes/_dark.scss\n   1. If you have dark-mode related questions, consider pinging `@psimyn`.\n1. Ensure that the changed pages work properly\n1. Merge away!\n\n#### Notes\n\nIn order to quickly get our application.css size down, hold off on any unneeded optimizations, however while you are looking at the page specific styles, you can choose to optimize the following things *or* preferably create follow-up issues:\n\n1. Replacing certain properties with utility classes\n1. Sometimes a page specific CSS might contain classes of *distinct* pages. Then we could split those. (e.g. pipelines css for lists vs pipelines css for details pages)\n1. Removing unused CSS\n\n#### EE specific styles\n\nee/ follows the same pattern described, simply place the file into `ee/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`.

[`toggle`](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toggle/#usage) would be more appropriate.\n\n### Why\n\nAccording to [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toggle/#usage) a checkbox is fine to use here, but I think a `toggle` might improve this interaction - anecdotally, when I want to turn something on or off, I look for a `toggle`.\n\n### Challenges\n\nIf we went with a toggle, the change should be immediately effective (i.e. the user shouldn't have to click \"save changes\" after toggling - the toggle itself should invoke the change immediately). This would likely require some refactoring of the current form.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-13T02:01:16.872Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:54:38.737Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T19:22:11.092Z","closed_by":{"id":516904,"username":"tauriedavis","name":"Taurie Davis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/516904/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tauriedavis"},"labels":["Pajamas","UX","devops::manage","frontend","group::integrations","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Pick an issue and assign yourself if you currently are not assigned.\n1. Preparation:\n   1. Figure out on which pages your CSS is used, note down the HAML files. Note: Sometimes page specific CSS can be used on multiple pages!\n   1. Move the file from `app/assets/stylesheets/pages` to `app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`\n   1. Remove it from `page_specific_files.scss`\n   1. Add the file to `config/application.rb`\n   1. Add `- add_page_specific_style 'page_bundles/example'` to all haml templates you have identified that are using these styles. (available once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43680 lands, in order to drive bias for action you can use `= stylesheet_link_tag 'page_bundles/example'`) for now.\n1. Use CSS variables for all the colors. This is **crucial** for dark mode.\n   1. If a color doesn't have an exact match with [Pajamas colors](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/colors), choose the nearest color from the Pajamas colors. If there isn't an exact match, see whether a dark mode variable is available: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/themes/_dark.scss\n   1. If you have dark-mode related questions, consider pinging `@psimyn`.\n1. Ensure that the changed pages work properly\n1. Merge away!\n\n#### Notes\n\nIn order to quickly get our application.css size down, hold off on any unneeded optimizations, however while you are looking at the page specific styles, you can choose to optimize the following things *or* preferably create follow-up issues:\n\n1. Replacing certain properties with utility classes\n1. Sometimes a page specific CSS might contain classes of *distinct* pages. Then we could split those. (e.g. pipelines css for lists vs pipelines css for details pages)\n1. Removing unused CSS\n\n#### EE specific styles\n\nee/ follows the same pattern described, simply place the file into `ee/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`. It is even possible to extend CE styles, see: [cycle_analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/84864ec304dca5ca85052cf8b41185286b48f5bc/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles/cycle_analytics.scss) and it's [ee version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/84864ec304dca5ca85052cf8b41185286b48f5bc/ee/app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles/cycle_analytics.scss).

https://chat.melroy.org\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn GitLab:\n\n* `New ...` -\u003e `New Group` -\u003e Fill-in the required fields (I selected a Public repo) and check the box `Create a Mattermost team for this group` -\u003e Press: `Create group` button.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThis action results in a time-out, showing 500 error message of GitLab.\n\n### What is the

The `deploy` should also be skipped, because it needs a failed job. This bug was [fixed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23405) for `when: on_success` jobs (#31526), but for `when: delayed` and `when: manual` were not considered in that fix.\n\n`.gitlab-ci.yml`\n\n```yaml\nimage: alpine\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  script: exit 1\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  script: exit 0\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  needs: [build, test]\n  when: delayed\n  start_in: 5 seconds\n  script: exit 0\n```\n\nPipeline:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-12_at_19.49.17](/uploads/46763fd4f3eedd12bad37e1360bfaa17/Screen_Shot_2020-12-12_at_19.49.17.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eold issue description\u003c/summary\u003e\nWhen running two jobs, where the second depends on the first, we normally get a canceled event for the second on the failure of the first. This is normal and expected. We can even make this very explicit by using the needs keyword.\n\nHowever, when we use rules to make this second job only work on certain tags, and make it delayed; the rules will make the job always be added to the pipeline, regardless of the previous outcomes. E.g. `on_success` is no longer honored.\n\nThis code existed 'pre-rules' for me as well, with except/only and was working as expected.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  script: exit 1\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ /^v\\d+\\.\\d+(\\.\\d+)+$/'\n      when: delayed\n      start_in: 2 minutes\n  needs:\n    - job: build\n      artifacts: true\n  script:\n    - echo \"Test success\"\n```\nHere, we expect the pipeline to not be allowed to be triggered on failure of execution of the 'build' step, however the timer happily ticks and on expiry runs the job.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Example Project\n\n- https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan/test-project/-/blob/f2c78177b4d7296aa88f1b47a3e895272424c4d6/.gitlab-ci.yml\n- https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan/test-project/-/pipelines/228912531\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nThe job 'deploy' runs, regardless of the state of 'build'\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nIf 'build' is canceled or fails, 'deploy' should be skipped same as `test`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n![image](/uploads/5f48b2b542dfe4a67523f2f8657d9816/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n~~It seems like with the new rules syntax ignores the 'on_success' behavior when doing delayed jobs, e.g. 'delayed' really means 'delayed_always'. If delayed should NOT do do this, then a new rule, delayed_on_success, which only runs when the previous job was successful, may need to be added.~~\n\nAdding the same condition

Remove On-demand landing page","description":"### Overview\nThe On-demand landing page was originally thought of as a one-time only page that would only show up if you've never run a scan before. Also, once other scanners use on-demand scans, it can be a way to select which scanner you want to use to create the scan. However, since DAST is currently the only scanner that uses on-demand scans and the landing page shows up every time you click on the link from the left nav, we should remove the page until we can have a more useful reason for the landing page to be shown.\n\n### Problem\nThe on-demand landing page shows up every time you click on the link in the left nav, but the page is useless as is and only creates an extra click to get where you want to go.\n\n### Solution\nRemove the current landing page and replace it with the On-demand DAST scan configuration page. This can be the workflow until we have a reason to reintroduce a more useful landing page.\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [ ] Documentation: No updates needed for https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#on-demand-scans\n- [ ] Feature flag: No\n- [ ] Performance:\n- [x] Testing: Unit tests should be updated.  No end-to-end coverage exists on this yet. \n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated. The plan can also\ncall-out responsibilities for other team members or teams.\n--\u003e\n\n~frontend \n\n- [x] For /on_demand_scans\n  - [x] Remove the landing page code\n  - [x] Show the `New on-demand DAST scan` initially\n\n\n## References\n\n1.

What impact would these changes have?\n\nThe goal of this is to test ideas and propose a solution we can then implement.\n\n### Implementation Plan \n\n1. [Test secure analyzers running as non-root user in OpenShift environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290240)\n1. [Test secure analyzers running as non-root user in automated offline testing environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/issues/695)\n1. [Merge and release secure analyzer Docker containers running as non-root user](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292207)\n1. [Document limitations of secure analyzers which run as non-root user](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292206)\n1. [Add Guidelines for Docker images to Secure Technical Documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292421)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nOnce we have a proposal we can hopefully test it with @willmeek  and then make a follow up issue or epic to implement.\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\nThe discovery conclusion provides one or multiple ways we can later implement to execute our Secure analyzers in an openshift environment.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nAs other secure (and other engineering) groups are impacted may want to chat in the main slack to find anyone else working this issue.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.\nRead the descriptions on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels to find the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-12T17:20:29.314Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T16:44:39.852Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T00:56:14.027Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Core","GitLab Premium","GitLab Starter","GitLab Ultimate","OpenShift","backend","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":3913516,"username":"NicoleSchwartz","name":"Nicole Schwartz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3913516/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NicoleSchwartz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281816","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281816","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281816/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281816/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#281816","relative":"#281816","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#281816"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4902,"epic":{"id":143565,"iid":4902,"title":"OpenShift support for Secure Software Composition Analysis","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4902","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74272901,"iid":281815,"project_id":278964,"title":"Convert \"Project\" -\u003e \"Members\" list view from HAML to Vue - Setup Vue application","description":"Required for https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4901\n\nOnce the data is passed to frontend in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281809 we will be ready to setup the Vue application. 95% of this should be shared components used by the group members view.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?

priority","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen using parent/child pipelines, variables are not passed to child according to documentation for [priority of variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/README.html#priority-of-cicd-variables)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nGitlab-ce 13.5.3 (eaa194f15e6) ubuntu packages\n(Also in GitLab Enterprise Edition 13.4.3-ee as reported in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273420) \n\nI conducted different tests by changing only the variable setup between child and parent pipeline.VAR is an example, can be anything. I tested various combinations between setting variable in schedule, parent pipeline and in bridge job calling the child pipeline. for each try I reported the values of the variable VAR, both in Parent and child \nBasically .gitlab-ci.yml has this structure:\n\n```\nvariables:\n  VAR: see below\n\nstages:\n  - job1\n  - bridge\n\njob1: \n stage: job1\n script:\n  - export\n\nbridge:\n  stage: bridge\n  variables:\n    VAR: see below\n  trigger:\n    include: child.yml\n```\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWith the setup above I performed the following tests:\n1. No variable VAR defined in schedule, Parent: VAR: false, bridge: VAR not present -\u003e job1 VAR=false, child VAR=false (as expected)\n2. schedule: VAR=true, Parent: VAR: false, bridge: VAR: $VAR -\u003e job1 VAR=true, child VAR=true (as expected)\n3. schedule: VAR=true, Parent: VAR: false, bridge: VAR not present -\u003e job1 VAR=true, child VAR=false (not really expected, I was expecting VAR in child to be true as schedule defined var should have priority)\n4. schedule: VAR not present, Parent VAR: false, bridge: VAR: $VAR -\u003e job1 VAR=false, child VAR=\"\\$VAR\"\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n```\ncase 3: job1 VAR=true, child VAR=true\ncase 4: job1 VAR=false, child VAR=false (and not the weirdly escaped string)\n```\n\nBasically the combined effect of 3 and 4 prevents to have this behavior: a default value set globally in parent job, modifiable by schedule variable settings and picked up by child jobs. It seems that child job either gets wrong priority and/or fails to escape the variable.\n\nNot sure about any workaround, maybe playing around with temporary variables or something like that.\nI can provide more information, but the gist is here.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe have 2 different bugs here:\n\n#### Bug 1.\n\n\u003e 3. schedule: VAR=true, Parent: VAR: false, bridge: VAR not present -\u003e job1 VAR=true, child VAR=false (not really expected, I was expecting VAR in child to be true as schedule defined var should have priority)\n\nfrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281201#note_496235308:\n\nThis could be caused by the fact that the pipeline schedule object from the parent pipeline is not propagated to the child pipeline in `Ci::Bridge#child_params`, like we do for `merge_request`.\n\nWhen we launched parent-child pipelines we only covered merge requests as MVC, [the rest needed to be done](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c50e046674c59d2dcb12610d92b9e0f605ce7de7/app/services/ci/create_pipeline_service.rb#L63-66).\n\nI believe by passing `schedule` downstream in `child_params`, the child pipeline will have an associated `schedule` object and the variables will be automatically propagated. Same bug may exist with `trigger_request` since it's not propagated either. While we fix that we could also propagate `external_pull_request` for completeness.\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eBug 2. (Out of scope) - not a bug but expected behavior \u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003e 4. schedule: VAR not present, Parent VAR: false, bridge: VAR: $VAR -\u003e job1 VAR=false, child VAR=\"\\$VAR\"\n\nfrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281201#note_511203592:\n\nThis happens because the top-level `variables:` is used as `default` values when the job-level `variables:` doesn't specify it. We basically merge job-level variables over the top-level variables. Because the job/bridge-level `variables:` specifies `VAR`, then it takes precedence over the top-level `VAR: foo`. This makes the variable `VAR: $VAR` to be treated literally since `$VAR` is nowhere else defined.\n\n```yaml\nvariables:\n  VAR: foo\n  VAR2: bar\n\njob:\n  script: echo $VAR\n  variables:\n    VAR: $VAR\n```\n\nThe above is equivalent to having:\n\n```yaml\njob:\n  script: echo $VAR\n  variables:\n    VAR: $VAR\n    VAR2: bar\n```\n\nI think if we were expanding the job-level variables using the top-level variables prior to merging them, it should fix it. This way `VAR: $VAR` is expanded using `{VAR: foo, VAR2: bar}` as dictionary which becomes `VAR: foo`. Then when merged, it still takes precedence over the top-level variable.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nExample project provided in duplicate issues \n-

calculation of seat overage in Licence.rb","description":"### Summary\n\nIn Licence.rb, there is an assumption that the licence being replaced starts at least 1 year before the licence.starts_at. This is not the case for all licences: Manually issued gitlab licences can be created with a period of exactly one year between starts_at and ends_at, and potentially other durations. \n\nIn the following situation this will result in a situation where the new licence of the customer fails to apply:\n\n- 2018-01-12 - Customer has a lot of active users on their instance: 100.\n- 2018-01-13 - Customer removes 50 users from their instance. Active users: 50.\n- 2018-01-15 - Customer installs a license for 50 users that is valid from 2018-01-15 to 2019-01-15, for a total time span of 1 year.\n- 2019-01-01 - Customer renews its license through the customer portal. It receives a license that is valid for 1 year, plus 2 weeks overlap with the previous license (2019-01-01 to 2020-01-15).\n- The license is validated in gitlab. GitLab validates the licence by comparing the licenses' `previous_user_count` with the maximum users in the year before the new licence was started. It queries the period between 2018-01-01 and 2019-01-01, and finds the maximum of 100 users (from before the start of the previous licence), and therefore fails to validate the licence because the count of 100 users is bigger than the `previous_user_count` - even though the number of seats in the previous licence was not violated / no overage was generated.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSee above.\n\n### Example Project\n\nN/A\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nLicences are validated based on incorrect assumptions\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nLicences are validated based on correct data.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nGL 13.5.2, GL 13.5.3\n\n\n### Possible fixes\ninclude a `previous_licence_period` in the licence as a companion for `previous_user_count`, to be able to correctly identify the period to use for the the `prior_historical_max` user count. Or don't issue licences that overlap with the licence they're replacing. \n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/license.rb#L559","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-11T14:19:43.905Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T10:00:09.009Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T10:00:08.893Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Provision","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::fulfillment","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"}],"author":{"id":2188580,"username":"matthias.vandemeent","name":"Matthias van de Meent","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2188580/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matthias.vandemeent"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281177","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281177","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281177/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281177/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7008"},"references":{"short":"#281177","relative":"#281177","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#281177"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74203302,"iid":281174,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add source sha256 to the internal pages api","description":"We want to use sha 256 as a cache key for the object-storage \"connection/archive\", we already collect it, so just need to expose it in the API.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-11T13:45:12.824Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T13:46:57.791Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T13:46:57.699Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Pages","Pages::Object Storage","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::release","group::release","section::ops"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

(+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e **thought**: We've changed the return type of this getter, using TypeScript notation, from the simple `string` to:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```typescript\n    \u003e type SecuritySummaryMessage {\n    \u003e   message: string;\n    \u003e   critical?: number;\n    \u003e   high?: number;\n    \u003e   other?: number;\n    \u003e }\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e And similarly for the `groupedTextBuilder` helper.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e This makes me a little uneasy, since JavaScript is weakly typed, it's easy to imagine these two functions diverging in their return type in future, causing subtle breakages. \n    \u003e \n    \u003e Our tests are quite thorough here, though, so perhaps this is fine.\n\n@aturinske wrote:\n\n\u003e I think that the best way to clean this up would be to pass the `security_summary` component all the data and let it generate the strings in there because that seems like a display concern anyways, so then these methods would go into the `security_summary` component and would not exist out here and then I do not have to worry about the type being output.\n\nThis approach would mean various utilities and getters could be removed or simplified. The component could just receive the plain counts of critical, high and other severity vulnerabilities, loading and error states, and generate the necessary message internally. Testing this would be straight-forward: given props, renders string. Some additional tests for the display/colouring logic too, but that's also simple.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-11T10:48:05.704Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:04:22.969Z","closed_at":"2021-03-25T20:16:18.490Z","closed_by":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay

This would allow most things to be seen in a more expected way when there is no background-color defined by the application.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-10T20:00:16.253Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T10:36:07.754Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T01:29:27.457Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Deliverable","UX","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"}],"author":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281026","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281026","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281026/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281026/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#281026","relative":"#281026","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#281026"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3138,"epic":{"id":44453,"iid":3138,"title":"Live Preview in the Web IDE","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3138","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74166544,"iid":281023,"project_id":278964,"title":"Global Search matching terms are difficult to read in dark mode","description":"In dark mode, we highlight the matching terms in a _very_ dark font color.

However, we've seen that users are not consistently consuming the content after they initially signup. To help users onboard themselves over a longer period of time as they adopt GitLab we'll test creating a new UI space for them to follow their onboarding progress. \n \n### Hypothesis\nBy providing users with a place they can easily navigate to, with reminders on their remaining items we will increase stage adoption and upgrades rates. \n \n### Experiment design\nIn this experiment, we'll enroll new namespaces (new signups) in either control or experiment cohorts. We'll then track the stage adoption and upgrade rates for namespaces in both the control and experiment groups. This experiment should be recorded in the experiments users table with a unique experiment_id. \n \n**Control**\n \nIn the control new namespaces will get the same experience today where they're given the onboarding issue board to onboard themselves. \n  \n**Experiment - variant 1A:**\nIn the experiment, new namespaces will land on the continuous onboarding page after signing up. The continuous onboarding UI element will remain present at the group and project level. The items within the continuous onboarding list will be automatically marked as \"completed\" when the namespace completes the underlying event (tracked in the table below). \n\n#### Flow\n\n![continuousOnboarding1A](/uploads/833da4d09043b15da5f21d9a9e803986/continuousOnboarding1A.gif)\n \n#### Page design:\n![image](/uploads/f9a630882e88cea061d1db50b0869ace/image.png)\n \nItems to be listed and associated events can be found in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/product/-/issues/1652/). We're in the final stages of clarifying the copy and events that will be utilized for the events. Once this process is completed we'll add the table to this issue. \n\n#### [📐 Design specs](https://www.figma.com/file/Tz3GdJPqSSQbviaSAnvFQH/Continuous-onboarding-Iteration?node-id=352%3A29893)\n\n**Experiment - variant 1B:**\n[This experiment variant](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/-/issues/306) will be built by the ~\"group::activation\" team and will be included in this multi-variant experiment. \n \n### Experiment tracking\nIn order to track the success of this experiment, we will enroll new signups (namespaces) into either the control or experiment 1A or experiment 1B groups, tracked in the experiments_users table with a unique experiment_id. We will enroll 33% of traffic into the control, 33% in variant 1 (design 1A, this issue) and 33% into variant 2 (design 1B, [being built by the Activation team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/-/issues/306))\n \nIn the experiment cohort, we'll also want to add events for: \n* Viewing the continuous onboarding page\n* Clicking on any items listed on the page, in the event details we should capture the item they clicked on. We should collect the display text and not the URL as the URL will relative to their namespace.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-10T19:55:15.764Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T14:04:17.085Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T17:07:16.046Z","closed_by":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"labels":["DEPRECATED Growth-Deliverable","Deliverable","Engineering","devops::growth","group::acquisition","growth experiment","missed-deliverable","missed:13.11","section::growth","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"}],"author":{"id":4413992,"username":"s_awezec","name":"Sam Awezec","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4413992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/s_awezec"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/281022","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281022","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281022/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/281022/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#281022","relative":"#281022","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#281022"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4875,"epic":{"id":142314,"iid":4875,"title":"[Engineering] Continuous onboarding","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4875","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
