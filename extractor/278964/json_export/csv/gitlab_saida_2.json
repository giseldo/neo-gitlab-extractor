Member-- source ---Namespace\n  Namespace-- Is A ---Group\n```\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6768 a parallel project membership system was established through the `members.member_namespace_id` column and the addition of the `ProjectNamespace` model. Every `Project` is parented by a `ProjectNamespace` model via the `projects.project_namespace_id` column.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  User --- Member\n  Member-- member_namespace_id ---Namespace\n  Namespace-- Is A ---Group\n  Namespace-- Is A ---ProjectNamespace\n  ProjectNamespace-- project_namespace_id ---Project\n```\n\nThis new system aligns our hierarchy so we only have `Namespaces` and not `Namespaces` and `Projects`.\n\nWe now need to replace all membership queries using the old polymorphic `source` system, with the new `member_namespace_id` system.\n\nAll replacements will need to be behind a feature flag.\n\n## To Do\n In this issue we want to address the way we gather members for the project members page. By creating the new MembersFinder we can leverage the new system and start by making changes in one place. This will also help us uncover any potential problems and gaps before rolling the changes further. \n\nThis change will be behind feature flag. \n\n### Availability and Testing\n\n- No new E2E tests or updates needed at this time. Since changes will be behind a feature flag, if the MR(s) for these changes updates a feature flag definition file, please review the `ee:instance-parallel` and `ee:instance-parallel-ff-inverse` jobs within `e2e:package-and-test`, which should be triggered automatically. \n- Otherwise, if these changes will be using an existing feature flag, please create a draft MR that includes these changes along with the feature flag definition file set to `default_enabled: true`. This will then trigger the jobs above to E2E test the changes with the FF both on and off (see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/feature_flags.html#automatic-test-execution-when-a-feature-flag-definition-changes for more details)\n- Feel free to ping `@vburton` if there are any questions on E2E test failures.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-14T13:20:04.948Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T16:28:11.629Z","closed_at":"2023-01-11T10:58:44.526Z","closed_by":{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia

ping context to redis_hll_counters.issues_edit.issues_edit_total_unique_counts_monthly","description":"## Background\n\nThere are two Product Intelligence data tracking systems in place at GitLab: [Service Ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) and [Snowplow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/) event tracking. Recently there was effort undertaken by ~\"group::product intelligence\" to mirror some of data reported by Service Ping with Snowplow event tracking to help GitLab members better understand wider community interactions with GitLab, and make better decision how to develop and improve it. \n \n## Problem\n\nThe snowplow events labeled with:\n- `redis_hll_counters.issues_edit.issues_edit_total_unique_counts_monthly`\ndoes not pass the required [context](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/schemas.html#gitlab_service_ping) yet to be usable for the data team.\n\n## Desired Outcome\n\nSnowplow event custom context (see [documentation](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/canonical-event/#contexts) about what context are) as defined [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/schemas.html#gitlab_service_ping) is passed to the event.\n\n## Implementation Guide\n\nFirst locate all places where `redis_hll_counters.issues_edit.issues_edit_total_unique_counts_monthly` is emitted (hint: see how Snowplow [frontend](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/implementation.html#implement-data-attribute-tracking) and [backend](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/implementation.html#implement-ruby-backend-tracking) tracking is implemented at GitLab\n\nIdentify what Service Ping RedisHll events were mirrored for example at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/issue_activity_unique_counter.rb#L169\n\n```ruby\n        def track_issue_cloned_action(author:, project:)\n          track_snowplow_action(ISSUE_CLONED, author, project)\n          track_unique_action(ISSUE_CLONED, author)\n        end\n```\nVia `ISSUE_CLONED` constant `g_project_management_issue_cloned` event is tracked\n\nFill out required context with eg: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/tracking/service_ping_context.rb for backend events\n\n```ruby\n      Gitlab::Tracking.event(\n        self.class.to_s,\n        name,\n        namespace: tracking_namespace_source,\n        user: current_user,\n        context: [Gitlab::Tracking::ServicePingContext.new(data_source: :redis_hll, event: name).to_context]\n      )\n``` \n\nOr create context manually for front end events eg: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/projects/pipelines/charts/components/app.vue#L85\n\n```vue\n\n        this.track('click_tab', {\n          label: SNOWPLOW_LABEL,\n          context: {\n            schema: SNOWPLOW_SCHEMA,\n            data: {\n              event_name: event,\n              data_source: SNOWPLOW_DATA_SOURCE,\n            },\n          },\n        });\n```\n\nTest you changes with [Snowplow Micro](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/implementation.html#snowplow-micro) included in gdk\n\nMake sure that all events from metric yaml definition [file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/metrics/counts_28d/20210216181504_issues_edit_total_unique_counts_monthly.yml#L18) has been tracked with snowplow context\n\nIn case of questions head to [`#g_product_intelligence` slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF) or tag `@gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/engineers` in comment in this issue\n\n## Testing\n\nUpdate related

What are some things you can think of that could go wrong - data loss or broken pages? --\u003e\n\n### Cleaning up the feature flag\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-11T09:15:38.179Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T12:02:13.197Z","closed_at":"2022-11-25T10:10:28.958Z","closed_by":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques

secret tokens can be leaked by maintainer changing URL","description":"**[HackerOne report #1757999](https://hackerone.com/reports/1757999)** by `joaxcar` on 2022-11-01, assigned to @greg:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce) | [Imported issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383113)\n\n## Report\n\nImported from h1: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383113\n\n#### Summary\n\nSince issue [#359989 (closed)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359989) was merged, webhook secrets are now hidden for maintainers of a project after they are saved. The UI and API gives no way of retrieving the secret after configuration.\n\nHowever, a maintainer with access to the project webhook settings could change the webhook URL to a different endpoint and extract the secret token via the request sent to that endpoint. \n\n#### Impact\n\nSecret webhook tokens are discoverable to project maintainers who change the webhook URL.\n\n#### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nSecret token value is retained, *not* reset upon changing the webhook URL.\n\n#### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nSecret token will be reset and not retained after changing a webhook URL.\n\n#### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n#### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues) to this section:\n\n1. Create a new project\n2. Go to https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/hooks and configure a webhook. Make sure you also add a secret token.\n3. Click save\n4. Invite another user to the project as a maintainer\n5. Log into GitLab as the newly-appointed maintainer\n6. Go to the project hooks as this user https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/hooks \n7. Modify webhook URL to point to an endpoint that can be used to sniff/extract the secret token (webhook.site)\n8. Test the webhook\n9. Get secret token from request header sent to the new endpoint\n10. (Optional) Change webhook URL back to original URL to restore functionality and reduce likelihook of detection\n\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381895","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-10T19:50:58.752Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T13:50:13.283Z","closed_at":"2022-12-07T12:38:58.075Z","closed_by":{"id":5791466,"username":"ngeorge1","name":"Nikhil George","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5791466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ngeorge1"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Category:Webhooks","Deliverable","Weakness::CWE-200","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::manage","group::integrations","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"}],"author":{"id":3645992,"username":"greg","name":"Greg Myers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3645992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/greg"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2023-01-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382260","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/382260","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/382260/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/382260/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#382260","relative":"#382260","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#382260"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9158,"epic":{"id":645118,"iid":9158,"title":"URL Masking Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9158","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118509547,"iid":382227,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add view event to  /almost_there (\"confirm your email\") page","description":"The purpose of this issue is to add structured events to the confirm your email page for both free and trial registration flows.

Or replication status in the admin area can be shown with errors.\n\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nAdmin Geo section\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n- [x] Test replication and verification of Dependency Proxy Manifests on a non-GDK-deployment. For example, using GitLab Environment Toolkit\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for a review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise, these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_replication --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376071 to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [x] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [x] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_replication`\".\n    - [x] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce the complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_replication --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the

The problem was related to the way the redirects generated by GitLab to S3 were signed.\n\nThis issue highlights that the same issue exists for generic packages (and possibly other package types) and that the same functionality should be available to support the use of a HEAD request to obtain key metadata values (e.g. size, etag) to assist with detecting when packages are updated in the registry.\n\nNote that when `proxy_download` is enabled GitLab retrieves the details from S3 and passes them back to the requesting client, and there is no problem. But enabling this setting is not always an option for customers due to the impact it has on server load and network traffic and associated costs.\n\nGET requests to retrieve the package file work OK whether `proxy_download` is enabled or not. \n\nThis issue was reported by a self-managed Premium customer ([ZD internal link](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/342316)). \n\nNote that there is currently an [open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381504) relating to HEAD requests for Maven projects no longer working in 15.4.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Configure the GitLab package registry to store package files in an S3 bucket.\n1. Set `gitlab_rails['object_store']['proxy_download'] = false` in GitLab to disable proxying of requests to object storage. Doing this means a GitLab will return a redirect response to the client directing it to retrieve the package file from S3 directly, with temporary credentials.\n1. Publish package file as a generic package to the GitLab package registry, e.g.:\n\n    ```\n    curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003ctoken\u003e\" --upload-file packagefile.pkg    \n    \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/24/packages/generic/my_package/0.0.1/packagefile.pkg\"\n    ```\n\n1. Run the following HEAD command via curl:\n\n    ``` \n    curl  -L --head --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003ctoken\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/24/packages/generic/my_package/0.0.1/pkgfile.pkg\n    ```\n\n1. Observe that a redirect to AWS S3 is received from GitLab and the response to that is a 403 error, e.g.:\n\n    ```\n    HTTP/1.1 302 Found\n    Server: nginx\n    Date: Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:19:21 GMT\n    Content-Type: text/plain\n    Content-Length: 518\n    Connection: keep-alive\n    Cache-Control: no-cache\n    Location: https://ubuntu-2004-15-4-3-registry.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2c/62/2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3/packages/24/files/9/pkgfile.pkg?X-Amz-Expires=600\u0026X-Amz-Date=20221110T081921Z\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX%2F20221110%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=7bea0ecc102039ddceba7ab9d49dbb39b2a685e7763d85e4aaa9ad0b4a700111\n    Vary: Origin\n    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n    X-Request-Id: 01GHG9YGSDPSBG50S2MRED19G0\n    X-Runtime: 0.084538\n    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000\n    Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\n\n    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n    x-amz-request-id: 2MZW7GXKM1M87KPW\n    x-amz-id-2: os5Gro+WgqLmqhW4qDVstAmUkZI1y2NWjUZM0wZ73M40DGWA/SGkoEP6RAKJZRCcHuRLl4ySpQg=\n    Content-Type: application/xml\n    Date: Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:09:58 GMT\n    Server: AmazonS3\n    ```\n\n\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status f6ab943eb4eb9ac222104875826a739e42569b2c`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com enable_environments_search_within_folder true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com enable_environments_search_within_folder true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e enable_environments_search_within_folder true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing estimated time when this feature flag will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set enable_environments_search_within_folder \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set enable_environments_search_within_folder \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set enable_environments_search_within_folder true`\n- [x] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete enable_environments_search_within_folder --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [x] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [x] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `enable_environments_search_within_folder`\".\n    - [x] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete require_approval_on_scan_removal --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `require_approval_on_scan_removal`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_assign_job_token_on_scheduling true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing estimated time when this feature flag will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_assign_job_token_on_scheduling \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_assign_job_token_on_scheduling false\n```\n\n\u003c!-- A feature flag can also be used for rolling out a bug fix or a maintenance work.\nIn this scenario, labels must be related to it, for example; ~\"type::feature\", ~\"type::bug\" or ~\"type::maintenance\".\nPlease use /copy_metadata to copy the labels from the issue you're rolling out.

The UI and API gives no way of retrieving the secret after configuration. Just like hidden tokens in integrations. The issue states\n\n\u003e Use type=\"password\" for the Secret token field input. We also have to make sure that the values are not exposed to the frontend\n\nAfter the fix the input field only show a line of dots when trying to edit a webhook. But the webhook logs at the same page still contains the secret in plain text.\n\nThe docs states this about the secret\n\n\u003e You can specify a secret token to validate received payloads. The token is sent with the hook request in the X-Gitlab-Token HTTP header. Your webhook endpoint can check the token to verify that the request is legitimate.\n\nThis change to the input field of the UI was made intentionally to hide the secret from other maintainers (as they do not necessarily have access to the receiving service). The leaked token (LOW confidentiality) gives an unauthorized other maintainer the ability to spoof requests to the receiving server (LOW integrity). And the impacted service is the receiving service (Scope changed). This was my rating of this, feel free to edit it as see fit!\n\n####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Log in to gitlab  \n2. Create a new project  \n3. Go to https://gitlab.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/hooks and configure a webhook. Make sure to add a secret  \n4. Click save  \n5. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the list of configured hooks.  \n6. Click edit on the new hook  \n7. You can now see that the secret is hidden  \n8. Scroll down and click \"test\", a test call will be made to the hook  \n9. Bellow the hook info there should now be a log entry, click the log entry  \n10. Scroll to the bottom of the log page to the request headers, there is the secret in plain text\n\n####  Impact\n\nThe UI leaks secret tokens that should not be accessible after configuration\n\n####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nSecret token headers are shown in webhook logs\n\n####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe secret token header should be redacted in the logs\n\n####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![secret.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c40f297a-c5a1-45ad-bad2-3aa14dd5a219/secret.png)\n\n![token.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/55cfc65b-166d-479f-a48f-a243ec5807f7/token.png)\n\n####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nThe UI leaks secret tokens that should not be accessible after configuration, allowing unauthorised maintainers to use the token\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

duplicate of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213138 blocked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213123. The testing feature of a lot of integrations is not working. We should create a sub-epic and organize all the work under https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5033.\n\nThis will also require ~UX.\n\n### What do we have to do here?\n1. Technical investigation. We should investigate what changes we need to implement the feature.\n2. Backlog organization. We should create follow-up issues (backend, frontend, UX), organize the existing ones, or create sub-epics. Basically, we have to organize all the work to be done and clarify possible blockers.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nPlease reach out to @sgregory2 to work out a test strategy alongside an implementation strategy.\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

Feature categories map directly to groups, but groups are more likely to change. Say, using this example, `project management` was split into two groups, one focused on team planning, and one focused on planning analyitcs, we'd probably want this to stay with the group assigned team planning.

It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nAdd a new tab to the Metrics Dictionary page to describe information that is collected that is not represented by a YAML file.

Make `bulk_insert` return ids for multiple events and fetch these events again from database using these ids.\n2. For single events use simple ActiveRecord insert. `event.save!`\n3.

The push events missing can be see by filtering for `push events` under a projects activity feed. Additionally, missing push events can cause CI Pipelines to not trigger as expected. All reports are from November 2nd 2022.\n\nIn one case, I've doubled checked the project events via rails console and found that the event didn't exist. This will be included in an internal note.\n\nZD Tickets:\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/341367\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/341529\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/341494\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/341332\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/341614\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUnable to reproduce.

As it appears to be hard coded up stream, this is going to be a lot messier than putting something in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. \n\n### Workaround\n\n- Define `pool.ntp.org` in /etc/hosts\n- It'll be necessary to define IP addresses, but to partly mitigate this, it should be possible to define multiple entries, in the same way that the NTP client would use multiple time sources.\n- If one of the NTP servers is shut down, the check is likely to fail intermittently.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nConfigure /etc/hosts to point pool.ntp.org to a local IP address that doesn't serve NTP:\n\n```plaintext\n# sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check\nChecking Geo ...\n\nGitLab Geo secondary database is correctly configured ... not a secondary node\nDatabase replication enabled? ... not a secondary node\nDatabase replication working? ... not a secondary node\nGitLab Geo HTTP(S) connectivity ... not a secondary node\nGitLab Geo is available ... \nGitLab Geo is enabled ... yes\nThis machine's Geo node name matches a database record ... no\n[snip]\nHTTP/HTTPS repository cloning is enabled ... yes\nMachine clock is synchronized ...

Given the wide scope of this issue, we'll start by focusing on **project rename** operations. Although out of the scope of this issue, project transfer operations should follow the same principle/implementation.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe inability to rename projects with registry data has been a known limitation of the GitLab Container Registry since its MVC release in %8.8. Right now, attempting to rename a project that has non-empty (at least one tag) container repositories leads to an error.\n\nThe current workaround is to delete all tags and only then the project can be renamed. As expected, this is far from being user-friendly and efficient.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project. We'll assume the project's full path is `my-group/my-project`;\n2. Tag and push an image to `registry.domain.com/my-group/my-project`;\n3. Attempt to rename the project. This fails with the message `Cannot rename project because it contains container registry tags!`\n\n## Current Implementation\n\nThis is the sequence of main actions on the Rails side whenever a user attempts to rename a project with registry data:\n\n1. [`ProjectsController#update`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/controllers/projects_controller.rb#L116-116)\n2. [`Projects::UpdateService#execute`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/services/projects/update_service.rb#L10-10)\n3. [`Projects::UpdateService#validate!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/services/projects/update_service.rb#L52-52)\n4. [`Projects::UpdateService#renaming_project_with_container_registry_tags?`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/services/projects/update_service.rb#L139-139). Here Rails loops over all known container repositories and queries the registry (using the OCI tags list operation) for each, in order to determine if any have tags. If so, the update is aborted and the message `Cannot rename project because it contains container registry tags!` is shown to users.\n\nIf no registry data was found in (4), the execution would proceed as follows:\n\n1. [`Projects::UpdateService#after_update`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/services/projects/update_service.rb#L101-101)\n2. [`Projects::AfterRenameService#execute`](hhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/services/projects/after_rename_service.rb#L40-40)\n3. [`Projects::AfterRenameService#first_ensure_no_registry_tags_are_present`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8fc45a11fdc4b1487514025334977859570c4c08/app/services/projects/after_rename_service.rb#L52-52). Here the validation from (4) above is repeated and the rename fails with message `Project #{full_path_before} cannot be renamed because images are present in its container registry` if there are any tags left.\n\n## Required Changes\n\nWithin this section, we'll assume a sample scenario where a user wants to rename the project `old-name` with full path `my-group/old-name` to `new-name`. Under `my-group/old-name`, we have five container repositories:\n\n- `A`: `my-group/old-name`\n- `B`: `my-group/old-name/sub-1`\n- `C`: `my-group/old-name/sub-1/sub-1-1`\n- `D`: `my-group/old-name/sub-2`\n- `E`: `my-group/old-name/sub-2/sub-2-1/sub-2-1-1`\n\n### Update Operation\n\nThere is currently no support for renaming a repository on the registry side. On its database, a repository has `path` and `name` attributes, where `name` is the last path segment of `path`. For example, for `A`, `name` is `old-name` and `path` is `my-group/old-name`. For `B`, `name` is `sub-1` and `path` is `my-group/old-name/sub-1`.\n\nSo, we have to update the `name` and `path` for the base repository (if exist) - `A`, and the `path` for all sub-repositories (if any) - `B`, `C`, `D` and `E`.\n\nThe most obvious option would probably be looping over the project's container repositories on the Rails side (looking at the `container_repositories` table) and sending an update request to the registry for each. However, besides increased latency, this approach poses two main problems:\n\n1. **Integrity:** If a non-transient failure occurs while updating `C`, we'd be left with a broken state where `A` and `B` have been renamed but not `C`, `D`, and `E`. While we could have some elaborated healing mechanisms, things can go wrong in many ways in between. For example, users push/pull images to/from the wrong repositories.\n\n2. **Security:** We can't guarantee that an unknown bug won't lead to repositories on the registry side that are unknown to Rails. In fact, we know this happened in the past (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217702). For example, imagine that another sub-repository `my-group/old-name/sub-3` exists on the registry but is unknown to Rails. If:\n\n   1. We don't update the path of this repository;\n   2. The project had sensitive data on the registry, so not all `my-group` members had access to it;\n   3. The project rename from `my-group/old-name` to `my-group/new-name` goes through;\n   4. A user `X` that had no access to `my-group/old-name` creates a new project, using the same `my-group/old-name` name;\n   5. User `X` gains access to the registry data that was left behind on `my-group/old-name/sub-3` :boom: \n\n   This only gets worse if we think about project transfers between groups or even namespaces :see_no_evil: \n\nFor the reasons above, we'd be better off doing an atomic bulk update on the registry side for the base repository and all (that exist, not just known by Rails) sub-repositories under it.\n\nTo make this happen we'll need a new `PATCH /gitlab/v1/repositories/\u003cpath\u003e/` API operation. This operation will accept changes to repository attributes, starting with their `name`. This should be called by Rails to update the `name` of a project's base repository. Internally, it should also update the `path` of the base repository and all its sub-repositories (if any).\n\n\u003csup\u003e*\u003c/sup\u003e Before attempting the update, the operation should start by ensuring that no repository with path `my-group/new-name` OR `my-group/new-name/%` exist. Otherwise, a `409 Conflict` should be returned. `path` has a unique index on the database, so, even if a repository was created between checking if it exists and the actual rename, a failure would occur and cause the transaction to be aborted. Nevertheless, we should avoid empty updates whenever possible (as those drive database bloat upwards), and check before.\n\nFor scalability and performance reasons, this feature will start by being **limited to projects with no more than 1000 container repositories**. For GitLab.com, this covers 99.98% of all projects ([source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/snippets/2280014#note_1191326600)). We can then increase this later based on metrics and pending a decision in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357014 (internal). Attempting to update more than 1000 repositories (base and sub-repositories) should yield a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response.\n\nI don't see the need to perform updates on `container_repositories` on the Rails side because we only record the `name` of repositories (last part of the path segment) and it is set to `\"\"` (empty) for base repositories. The full path of a repository is assembled in real-time based on the project's full path and the repository `name`.\n\n### Pre-Validation\n\nAs explained above, the current Rails implementation is split into two main parts: 1) pre-validation to ensure that the rename is technically possible and 2) post-rename changes.\n\nIdeally, the devised solution would guarantee the following:\n\n1. We can check that the target repositories name/path is not yet taken on the registry *prior* to performing the rename. This would be part of the Rails pre-validation steps;\n2. We can prevent writes to origin and target repositories between the pre-validation steps and the rename completion. This is to avoid race conditions and prevent data consistency/integrity issues.\n\nFor (1), we can do so by providing a \"dry-run\" option on the same  `PATCH /gitlab/v1/repositories/\u003cpath\u003e/` API operation. Having this validation functionality as a separate operation could mean not doing it before the actual update as initially described in \u003csup\u003e*\u003c/sup\u003e.\n\nFor (2), we could stop providing JWT tokens with write permissions on the Rails side for all *known* repositories associated with the project being renamed. However, this would not include repositories unknown to Rails, and clients that obtained a token before this lock period started could still use it for writes against the repositories before the token expired (15 minutes for GitLab.com).\n\nA more robust option for (2) means acquiring a special \"rename lease\" on the registry side before every write operation. In practice this would imply the following:\n\n- When processing the dry-run rename request, the registry would acquire a rename lease for paths that match `^my-group\\/(old-name|new-name)($|\\/.*$)`. This lease would have a short TTL of `N` seconds after which writes against a matching repository would be no longer blocked. If the dry-run succeeds (the rename is technically possible), Rails would be informed in the response that it had `N` seconds to complete the operation. If the dry-run did not succeed, the lease would be released ahead of time.\n\n- When receiving the non-dry-run rename request, the registry would ensure the lease is still alive and enough time remains before it expires (e.g., it won't expire before the configured DB transaction timeout of 10 seconds). If so, the rename proceeds, otherwise it's halted and Rails should get back to square one. Leases would be released at the end of a request, regardless of the result.\n- Across the whole registry API, a write request against a given repository (be that a blob upload, a tag delete, etc.) would only be allowed if a rename lease for the target repository does not exist.\n\nOn the Rails side, project owners/maintainers would be informed in the UI that renaming a project causes all its container repositories to be locked against writes for the whole duration of the operation.\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain

Since `Guest` users can view epic data, there is no concern of leaking data by allowing this behavior.\n\n**In this issue, we will change the minimum role requirement in both groups to `Guest`.** Note, this change is creating consistency with the change in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381307.\n\n**Note**: Permissions should be updated in all endpoints (REST, internal GraphQL)\n\n**Note 2**: Updated permissions should include checks for `related_epics` feature\n**Note 3**: The policy `:admin_epic_relation` added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106415 should be used to replace `:admin_epic`.\n\n## Docs Support\n\nFor issues requiring an update to GitLab docs, please note that this is part of the definition of done for this issue.
