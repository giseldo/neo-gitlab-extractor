structured the validation code such that it will return the last successful validation for a given `project_id` and `url_base` if one already exists. this means that if there is a more recent

Additional Information in Vulnerability Report export","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nInclude more comprehensive information in Security Dashboard exports to allow for complete and connected documentation. Additional fields enable linking of detections and responses that would otherwise be absent.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThe current export from the Vulnerability Report lacks information. The vulnerability objects contain more details than are exported. For example, what project/file/line the vulnerability was found in.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nIf somebody is exporting the data to CSV they are probably doing so because they need to maintain a record for security compliance, and the security dashboard isn't cutting it (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/272485). The export is great! However, it doesn't provide all the information that is available in the web UI.\n\n![image](/uploads/ee3df25ef68029862524062b4c4a9ffd/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/a74d2b2eec72febe6132b8d26e444447/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nInclude the following really useful fields in the CSV export for the Project, Group, and Security Center exports:\n\n* Date Detected\n* Location of detection\n   * for files: file path and name, line number(s)\n   * for apps/endpoints: the URL\n   * for containers: the image name and container location\n* Activity, specifically if a vulnerability is no longer detected\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdate https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#export-vulnerabilities to capture the newly-added fields. It would be helpful to add examples of what the location fields might contain when the results is for a file, an image, or a URL.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

Upon attempting to complete the order, they received the error:\n\n\u003e {\"last_name\":[\"can't be blank\"]}\n\nThis prevents the purchase, and resulted in a support ticket. The workaround was for customer to create a customerDot account, and proceed with purchase in the traditional manner.\n\nI'm opening this bug on the gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com project for now because it's not fully clear to me yet where exactly the bug is at, though I suspect it's on the .com side. We can move it as needed.\n\nMy suspicion that this is a .com bug is based on a few factors:\n\n1. [Quite some time ago](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13661), gitlab.com began [experimentally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/engineering/-/issues/64) requiring a \"Last Name\" field for new user registration\n   1. A [separate MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42346) recently began to \"split\" legacy names into a first and last name field. If I understand the design in that MR, it *can* cause an empty string for a last name\n1. [Kibana log](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7e98fff77a38dda1a9a7ed869137d7d2) of the customer hitting `SubscriptionsController#create` via `/-/subscriptions/new` on GitLab.com.  There is no associated Sentry errors for customer.gitlab.com that I can locate\n1. Prior to the support ticket being created, customer never had a customersDot account, so it's not possible that they would have attempted a purchase from customer portal. However, I'm unfamiliar with the behind-the-scenes code, so it's possible group billing page is calling out to customerDot to process the transaction. To the best of my knowledge, purchases from customersDot do require a `last_name` field.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPresumably using any GitLab.com user without a `last_name` (or a blank one), from any group not currently on a paid tier, navigate to Settings \u003e Billing page, click \"Upgrade\" under any of the 3 paid tiers. Note, \"Upgrade\" is displayed regardless if it's a new subscription or an actual upgrade from a lower tier.\n\nProceed normally by filling in details.\n\nPurchase fails.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNew purchase workflow from GitLab.com UI results in inability to purchase.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nA successful transaction\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Use customersDot.\n* *Possibly* edit GitLab.com user profile `name` field to be two \"words\", causing the name to split into a first and last name. This was not confirmed\n  * It is currently [not possible](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CDLCBGEDV/p1603382908188600?thread_ts=1603381169.185600\u0026cid=CDLCBGEDV) to edit one's profile and manually enter a Last Name, nor is it possible for an admin to enter one.\n\n### Related Issues / Epics\n\n1.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Previously only scala users with \u003c1.3 were supported because we supported `ivy`, we now support both `ivy` and `coursier` dependency managers.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDependency Scanning support for scala projects using `sbt` is not compatible with projects using sbt 1.3+.\n\nAfter 1.3+, `sbt` uses `coursier` as a default dependency manager, rather than `ivy`. As `gemnasium-maven` relies on an `ivy` report generated by the `sbt-dependency-graph` plugin, processing of `coursier` projects fails.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn order to be compatible, `gemnasium-maven` needs to add support for the `coursier` dependency manager.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe `gemnasium-maven` analyzer uses the `sbt-dependency-graph` plugin to create a graph of the scanned project's dependencies. The graph currently created uses the `ivyReport` format which only works with the `ivy` dependency manager. The analyzer needs to change the output format. One that supports both `ivy` and `coursier`\n\nThere are 2 modes that are available which render a dependency graph (required by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229818): `dot` and `graphml`. The decision to use one of these should be based on robustness of representation and community support for this format. The weight for either choice ought to be similar as `golang` parsers exist for both of these formats.\n\nNote: Based on further investigation it seems that `dot` is much more robustly supported as a `golang` lib and a module we already use (`gonum`) builds in basic parsing (`dot` -\u003e `graph`) for this format.\n\nAdditionally:\nThe [sbt-dependency-graph README](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-dependency-graph#sbt-dependency-graph) states:  `Note: Under sbt \u003e= 1.3.x some features might currently not work as expected or not at all (like dependencyLicenses)` - the solution should validate different dependency configurations to make sure dependency processing is robust. One concrete robustness criterion should be for [dependency scanning of sbt sub-projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255045).\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [ ] add QA job to `gemnasium-maven` that demonstrates sbt 1.3.0 support; this QA job uses an existing branch of [tests/scala-sbt](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/scala-sbt), or else a new branch\n- [ ] update the `sbt` builder of `gemnasium-maven` to generate an `sbt` dependency report using a call to `dependencyDot` of the `sbt-dependency-graph` plugin (ensure that this functionality works in `sbt` 1.4 as the plugin is in-sourced: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271345#note_444624604)\n- [ ] add new dependency file parser to `gemnasium`, to process the dot file and generate a dependency graph (we already use `gonum/graph`), and enable this parser in `gemnasium-maven`\n- [ ] if possible, remove the parser that processes ivy reports from `gemnasium`\n- [ ] double-check the `gemnasium-maven` offline functionality (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/master/Dockerfile#L36, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/tree/master/utils/sbt-dependency-graph-plugin) to ensure that inclusion of the plugin continues to work in offline mode given the fact that the plugin was in-sourced in `sbt` 1.4\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n- [ ] [Dependency Scanning documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#supported-languages-and-package-managers) needs to be updated to document support for `coursier`.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n- [ ] test sbt \u003c 1.3 (existing)\n- [ ] test sbt 1.3 (needs to be added)\n- [ ] test sbt 1.4 since usage of the `sbt-dependency-graph` plugin and some functionality may have changed\n\n#### Involved components\n\nAnalyzers:\n\n- [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) needs to be updated\n- [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven-plugin) needs to be updated\n\nTests:\n- [scala-sbt](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/scala-sbt/)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template.

rules:\n\n* [x] Update project-level push rules in API -\u003e `PushRules::CreateOrUpdateService`\n* [x] Update project-level push rules in app and API -\u003e `PushRules::CreateOrUpdateService`\n* [-] Delete project-level push rules in API -\u003e `PushRules::DestroyService` - not needed as there is no facility to delete push rule from the controller. \n\n### Related links\n\n- This was

cookies","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nGitlab administrators now have the option to configure Gitlab so that the Piwik/Matomo integration is used without cookies, per the Piwik API. \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nGitlab-Piwik/Matomo integration currently invokes the Piwik API in a way such that end-users receive additional cookies from Piwik. These cookies are sometimes undesirable for a number of reasons, including the legal requirement to inform users of their existence.\n\n### Intended users\n\nThe following roles will have an interest in this option:\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhen this option is enabled, the burdened is lessened for the informing of users of cookies that are stored in their browser. \nIn a broader context, new users (and users with a new browser) might not need to confirm the acceptance of cookies.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe add an option to gitlab.yml and to the piwik handling code to request via the Piwik API to not use cookies.\n\n### Further details\n\nA Data analysis team wants to track a self-hosted Gitlab installation using Piwik. However, the Data Security officer notes that it is\nrequired to disclose the use of the corresponding cookies to new users. Since Piwik has the option of disabling these cookies, \nthe various parties negotiate the possibility of using Piwik but without cookies. The System Administrator then configures\nthe Gitlab installation to use Piwik, but without the use of Piwik-generated cookies.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nOnly changeable for site administrators and requires a unicorn-restart.\n\n### Documentation\n\nI could find no existing documentation on the Piwik-Gitlab integration feature. It is purely documented within the comments of the configuration file (`gitlab.yml`) and corresponding Omnibus installation. I suspect there is little value in providing this documentation, unless the configuration option is migrated to the UI, which is way above my skillset.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n* Unit test changes\n  * Unit tests should ensure the new configuration option does not break existing functionality\n  * Unit tests should test `true` and `false` values for different generated javascript\n* Integration test changes\n  * In conjunction with a Piwik service, when option is true, the client should not receive Piwik-generated cookies. When it is false or undefined, the client will receive Piwik-cookies as it does now.\n* End-to-end test change\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSee Testing\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nN/A\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n?\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-22T14:03:27.097Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T20:00:59.759Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T20:00:59.664Z","closed_by":{"id":4373269,"username":"ali-gitlab","name":"Alishan Ladhani","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4373269/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ali-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","devops::growth","group::product intelligence","section::growth","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4373269,"username":"ali-gitlab","name":"Alishan Ladhani","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4373269/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ali-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":1083216,"username":"otheus.uibk","name":"otheus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f223e6842a7683aa71cbe0110da8d8d4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/otheus.uibk"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4373269,"username":"ali-gitlab","name":"Alishan Ladhani","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4373269/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ali-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271263","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/271263","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/271263/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/271263/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#271263","relative":"#271263","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#271263"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73171332,"iid":271258,"project_id":278964,"title":"Converge on a test session solution for futher validation research","description":"## Problem to Solve\n\nBy automating the creation of issues, the QA team has been piloting the relationship of [test session reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcase-sessions/-/issues?page=3\u0026state=opened) and [test cases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues).

I'm not sure that this will be better or worse than it is right now though.\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.\n--\u003e\n\n## Involved components\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease select the appropriate label from the following:\n    ~\"feature::addition\"\n    ~\"feature::maintenance\"\n    ~\"tooling::pipelines\"\n    ~\"tooling::workflow\"\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-21T17:08:30.833Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T10:10:43.658Z","closed_at":"2021-02-18T21:17:59.524Z","closed_by":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"labels":["Category:Code Quality","Deliverable","backend","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.7","missed:13.8","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"user_notes_count":46,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271077","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/271077","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/271077/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/271077/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#271077","relative":"#271077","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#271077"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4609,"epic":{"id":126342,"iid":4609,"title":"Code Quality Notices on MR Diffs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4609","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":73110857,"iid":271020,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Gitleaks to report capture group","description":"### Problem to solve\nThe secrets analyzer should be updated to include the addition of `captureGroup` in gitleaks.toml configuration files.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nThe Parallel `matrix` keywords allow you to run a job multiple times in parallel, using different variable values for each instance of the job, in this release we've added the Parallel keyword to a trigger job allowing you to run multiple downstream pipelines in parallel  (child or multi projects pipelines) using different variables value for each downstream pipeline, giving speed and flexibility to your pipelines.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nI can't run parallel matrix in job that triggers child pipelines.\nThis job fails in Linter:\n\n```yaml\ntest_pipeline:\n  trigger:\n    include: CI/tests.yml\n  parallel:\n    matrix:\n      - HW_REVISION:\n        - REV_A\n        - REV_B\n  variables:\n    HW_REVISION: $HW_REVISION\n```\nWith this error:\n\n```\njobs:test_pipeline config contains unknown keys: parallel\njobs:test_pipeline config should contain either a trigger or a needs:pipeline\n```\nSo looks like I can't use `parallel` keyword in job with `trigger`\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\nAnybody who use the matrix builds and want to move some jobs in separate pipeline.\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager).

The assets are artifacts of the job.\n\nThe fields have been added to the backend code, and the report schema. All that is left is identifying how to generate the asset links.\n\nRelates to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/260432\n\n### Proposal\n\nTwo asset types of asset links are needed, download all artifacts and individual file artifacts. The asset links can be constructed by the scanner as they are deterministic.\n\nExample download all artifacts for job:\n\n`https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-fuzzing-poc/-/jobs/739364672/artifacts/download`\n\nExample download single artifact for job:\n\n`https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-fuzzing-poc/-/jobs/739364672/artifacts/file/gl-api_fuzzing-logs.log`\n\n#### Change EndPoint to include scheme\n\nCurrently the target endpoint (server) definition lumps all schemes together. This makes it impossible to reconstruct the full URL as the scheme isn't recorded with the actual requests being sent.\n\nTo allow actual requests to be re-constructed correctly for the assets, the `EndPoint` will be keyed as the base url instead of url authority (host:port).\n\n#### Add new `FUZZAPI_REPORT_ASSET_PATH` variable\n\nA new variable is needed to provide the path to save report assets to. This folder is where report assets will be saved too. The CI template will use this variable to pickup the assets.\n\n### Tasks\n\n1. [x] Generate assets on disk\n1. [x] Add asset links to security report\n1. [x] Update template to pass project path and job id to scanner engine\n1. [ ] If UX works with asset fields, update docs\n1. [x] Generate new default sqlite db\n1. [x] Disable debug messages in py lib\n\n/cc @sethgitlab @stkerr","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-21T00:26:03.890Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T14:51:50.531Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T16:50:43.707Z","closed_by":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"labels":["Category:Fuzz Testing","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"}],"author":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/270929","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":5},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/270929","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/270929/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/270929/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#270929","relative":"#270929","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#270929"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4484,"epic":{"id":116343,"iid":4484,"title":"Implement API Fuzz testing results in Security Dashboard","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4484","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73063637,"iid":270896,"project_id":278964,"title":"Search Autocomplete: Review how icons are generated","description":"The search autocomplete drop down uses icons from Group and Projects for displaying items from those items and references which belong to them.

We are currently showing the path (parent Group(s)/namespace) along with the Group or Project title all in one line.

Unfortunately, we don’t add any other context into that calculation.\n\n## Current Problem\n\nHere’s the essentials of the current implementation:\n\n```ruby\n# We set a cookie with a random, unique id if none already exists\ncookies.permanent.signed[:experimentation_subject_id] = {\n  value: SecureRandom.uuid,  # looks like: 02bb3668-4600-4646-baa0-01f0985e444b\n  secure: ::Gitlab.config.gitlab.https,\n  httponly: true\n}\n\n# In order to use that uuid to check for inclusion in/exclusion from an experiment, we convert it to an \"index\" number\ncookies.signed[:experimentation_subject_id].delete('-').hex % 100\n# =\u003e 02bb3668-4600-4646-baa0-01f0985e444b \u003c-- the initial uuid\n# =\u003e 02bb366846004646baa001f0985e444b \u003c-- the uuid without '-' characters\n# =\u003e 3630519015627625743904611280021767243 \u003c-- the hex value of the uuid\n# =\u003e 43 \u003c-- that hex value mod 100\n\n# When we ask if a specific experiment is enabled, we send along the experiment key and the above \"index\" number\nExperimentation.enabled_for_value?(experiment_key, experimentation_subject_index)\n# experiment_key could be :group_only_trials or :customize_homepage\n# experimentation_subject_index is the above number (43 in this case)\n\n# Which means that for any given percentage breakdown (let's say 50%), the same user will **always** be in the same group (i.e. control or experimental)\nExperimentation.enabled_for_value?(:default_to_issues_board, 43) # =\u003e true\nExperimentation.enabled_for_value?(:group_only_trials, 43) # =\u003e true\nExperimentation.enabled_for_value?(:customize_homepage, 43) # =\u003e true\n```\n\nI'm not sure that this is what we want.\n\n## Suggested Solution\n\nI think a very simple solution would be to include the `experiment_key` as part of the `experimentation_subject_index` calculation:\n\n```ruby\nExperimentation.enabled_for_value?(experiment_key, experimentation_subject_index(experiment_key))\n\ndef experimentation_subject_index(experiment_key)\n  return if experimentation_subject_id.blank?\n\n  Zlib.crc32(\"#{experiment_key}#{experimentation_subject_id}\") % 100\nend\n```\n\nGranted, this changes that value for existing experiments, so we might either need to set a cut-off or provide a new way \u0026 an old way. I think we could add more metadata to the `EXPERIMENTS` hash at the top of the file to help accommodate the migration.\n\nPlease review [the MR](!45733) for further details on what the solution looks like in practice.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-20T20:52:55.371Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T17:44:12.058Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T16:09:06.893Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"labels":["Engineering","devops::growth","group::acquisition","section::growth"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"}],"author":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/270858","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/270858","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/270858/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/270858/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#270858","relative":"#270858","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#270858"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73044054,"iid":270585,"project_id":278964,"title":"Block quick actions for test case issue type","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nOn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/245303 we introduced some code to block features by issue type,\nwe also did block promotions quick action for test cases.  \n\nThis is a follow up to block additional quick actions that are not supposed to be allowed for test cases.  \n\nBlock the following quick actions for test cases:    \n\n* /assign @user  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50396\n* /reassign @user1 @user2 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50396\n* /epic \u003cepic\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40509\n* /confidential https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/50460\n\n\n\n### Urgency\n\nIf these quick actions are used currently, no real harm will occur as we aren't displaying these attributes anyway.

(+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e @philipcunningham I wonder if this change was necessary? The `id` field was [already expressed as a Global ID](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html#exposing-global-ids). I think we can freely swap a `GraphQL::ID_TYPE` in a type with `::Types::GlobalIDType[::DastScannerProfile]` because the client receives both as a `String`, and in this case, both fields produce the same `String`. cc @alexkalderimis to fact-check me here :slight_smile:.\n\n\u003c/hr\u003e\n\n\u003e @philipcunningham I wonder if we could:\n\u003e \n\u003e * Change the `id` field to be a `::Types::GlobalIDType[::DastScannerProfile]`\n\u003e * un-deprecate `id`\n\u003e * deprecate `global_id`\n\u003e \n\u003e It may seem a bit odd to un-deprecate, but I think this should be fine.
