[{"id":72293053,"iid":263102,"project_id":278964,"title":"Gitlab::Git::PreReceiveError: You are not allowed to manage designs of this project","description":"### About\n\nWhen moving an issue we copy the design collection. Copying the design collection involves adding commits to the design repository. It looks like some users have permission to move the issue (`:admin_issue` on the target project), but not permission to push to the design repository of that project and are being denied by [`GitAccessDesign#check_can_create_design!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/461dd303229febe5f136cc56001811f5b1c1088e/lib/gitlab/git_access_design.rb#L27-31). \n\n### Proposal\n\nWe could use the `Project#default_owner` to perform all of the git actions instead of the `current_user` (git actions are performed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/949ff817eedac1b89c1879097e437a217125048c/app/services/design_management/copy_design_collection/copy_service.rb#L99),

[here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/949ff817eedac1b89c1879097e437a217125048c/app/services/design_management/copy_design_collection/copy_service.rb#L127) and [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/949ff817eedac1b89c1879097e437a217125048c/app/services/design_management/copy_design_collection/copy_service.rb#L158)). \n\nWe will still record the correct `Version#author` of the design in PostgreSQL (as we do now), and we would [still check the user can `:admin_issue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/949ff817eedac1b89c1879097e437a217125048c/app/services/design_management/copy_design_collection/copy_service.rb#L80) the target issue before performing the copy (`admin_issue` is in-line with the permissions in [`Issue#can_move?`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/949ff817eedac1b89c1879097e437a217125048c/app/models/issue.rb#L300) so we know users who kicked off an issue move will have that permission).\n\n### Sentry

This allows an attacker to forge `GET` requests within the domain of `gitlab.com` or a self-hosted GitLab instance on the behalf of a victim and deny the service of said simple PyPi API endpoint to users. This vulnerability applies to both, `gitlab.com` and self-hosted GitLab instances and requires user interaction (i.e, a single click).\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a new project or refer to an existing project with the package registry enabled ([by default](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/#disable-the-package-registry), the package registry is enabled).  \n2. Create a PyPi package by uploading a package file through GitLab\u0026#39;s API:\n\n    ```bash  \n   curl -v \u0026#34;https://__token__:$PAT@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT/packages/pypi\u0026#34; -F content=\u0026#39;@/tmp/help\u0026#39; -F requires_python=3.8 -F version=1 -F name=\u0026#39;totally_innocent_package\u0026#39; -F sha256_digest=\u0026#39;../../../../../../..\u0026#39;  \n    ```  \n    with `$PAT` being your personal access token and `$PROJECT` being the ID of the targeted project.  \n3. Visit: `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21471488/packages/pypi/simple/totally_innocent_package`.  \n4. Click on the link `help`.  \n5. Observe being redirected to `gitlab.com/help`.\n\n*Note*: the project I use in this example is only visible to me, please let me know if you want me to change that.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can mislead a user to think that they download a package file by clicking on its link, whereas they will be directed to another resource on the same domain. Especially with self-hosted GitLab instances [on a relative URL](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#configuring-a-relative-url-for-gitlab) (e.g., `example.com/gitlab`), the attacker can route the victim to a malicious, possibly attacker-controlled, resource (e.g., a phishing website). Secondly, injecting unallowed characters into the URL\u0026#39;s path leads to a status code `500` on the simple PyPi API endpoint, effectively denying service for users (refer to an example of that below).\n\n#####  Examples\n\nThe exemplary project in the reproduction steps illustrates how to route a victim to another resource. I have verified that these steps also apply to a self-hosted GitLab instance with the latest version of GitLab, i.e., 13.4.2.\n\n######  Denial of Service\n\n1.

Especially with self-hosted GitLab instances [on a relative URL](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#configuring-a-relative-url-for-gitlab) (e.g., `example.com/gitlab`), the attacker can route the victim to a malicious, possibly attacker-controlled, resource (e.g., a phishing website). Secondly, injecting unallowed characters into the URL\u0026#39;s path leads to a status code `500` on the simple PyPi API endpoint, effectively denying service for users.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-06T18:48:32.822Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T13:03:31.147Z","closed_at":"2022-05-02T21:54:38.590Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew

individual Release page to use GraphQL","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe main **Releases** page ([this one, for example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases)) uses GraphQL (implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214241), but the individual **Release** page ([this one, for example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v13.4.0-ee)) still uses the REST API.\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the individual **Release** page to use GraphQL.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis will be _much_ simpler than converting the main **Releases** page, because:\n\n1. We know we already have all the data we need in the GraphQL endpoint\n1. We don't have to deal with pagination, since this page only shows a single release\n   1. This was the primary source of complexity when completing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214241.\n1. We already have patterns in place for making GraphQL queries for this data\n\n### Benefits\n\nCurrently, any improvements we make to the **Releases** page that involve backend data ([for example, something like this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205349)) will only be visible on _one_ of the pages (depending on which endpoint we update).\n\nAfter this change, these pages will automatically stay in sync because they will both be using the same endpoint (GraphQL).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThere should be no changes to permissions or security as part of this change.\n\n### Documentation\n\nNo documentation is necessary for this change.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-06T16:11:32.519Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T18:59:31.499Z","closed_at":"2020-10-21T18:59:31.465Z","closed_by":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie

duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nFollow-up of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40740#note_422135528.\n\nWhen using an explicit mapping for a rails `Enum`, we can set it to `nil`:\n\n```ruby\nenum status: { unscheduled: nil, scheduled: 1 }\n```\n\nBut doing so, the generated method `#status_unscheduled?` doesn't work as expected as it will return `false` for models that have `status` set to `nil`.\n\nThis appears to be a rails ~bug \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n* `#status_unscheduled?` returns `false` for models with `status` set to `nil`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n* `#status_unscheduled?` should return `true` for models with `status` set to `nil`\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nFrom @sabrams \n\n\u003e is this a :bug: in Rails :speak_no_evil:? If I'm [reading the source correctly](https://github.com/kamipo/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/enum.rb#L193), the `{attribute}?` enum method will add `to_s` to `nil` here, which will cause this to be `nil.to_s == nil // \"\" == nil =\u003e false`. Note 4 lines above the code I linked is `label.to_s`.\n\n* Check the other methods: `#unscheduled!` and `#unscheduled`\n* Check with the `master`

These groups can be top-level or sub-groups.\n- There should be a limit of 20 segments for the instance (for performance reasons because segments will be used for [DevOps Adoption](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247130)).\n- There should be a limit of 20 groups per segment (again for performance reasons).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-06T07:13:00.042Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T19:17:55.131Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T07:30:14.690Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"labels":["Next Up","backend","devops::manage","direction","frontend","group::optimize","missed:13.6","priority::1","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262395","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262395","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262395/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262395/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#262395","relative":"#262395","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#262395"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4169,"epic":{"id":92077,"iid":4169,"title":"[DevOps adoption] Instance-level adoption + Segments","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4169","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72234074,"iid":262394,"project_id":278964,"title":"Show user status in snippets authored by","description":"## Description\n\nIdentified on `.com`.

Navigate to the creation of a new repository, import from Bitbucket Server\n2. enter your credentials and server url\n3. Click on 'List your Bitbucket Server repositories'\n4. only the 26.-n. repositories are shown (probably alphabetically ordered)\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe importer asks the Bitbucket server only from the 26. repo upwards.\nA webserver-access log to the bitbucket-server from GitLab:\n```\n\u003cIPADDRESS\u003e - \u003cUSERNAME\u003e [06/Oct/2020:01:29:25 +0200] \"GET /rest/api/1.0/repos?start=25\u0026limit=25 HTTP/1.1\" 200 6379 \"-\" \"-\"\n\u003cIPADDRESS\u003e - \u003cUSERNAME\u003e [06/Oct/2020:01:29:26 +0200] \"GET /rest/api/1.0/repos?start=50\u0026limit=25 HTTP/1.1\" 200 73 \"-\" \"-\"\n```\nAs seen above, a request with GET-Parameter start=0 isn't made, so the first 25 repos are ignored by GitLab. If I add dummy repos with a low alphanumeric value (e.g. a0 ... a24), they are count as the first 25 repos and all my real repos are showing up in the importer.\nThis was probably introduced with code belongs to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/22825, but I'm not sure at that.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAlso the first 25 repos should be imported, so a additional request with start=0 has to be made.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\nSystem information\nSystem:         Debian 10\nCurrent User:   git\nUsing RVM:      no\nRuby Version:   2.6.6p146\nGem Version:    2.7.10\nBundler Version:1.17.3\nRake Version:   12.3.3\nRedis Version:  5.0.9\nGit Version:    2.28.0\nSidekiq Version:5.2.9\nGo Version:     unknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:        13.4.2\nRevision:       b08b36dccc3\nDirectory:      /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:     PostgreSQL\nDB Version:     11.9\nURL:            https://git.alex-detsch.de\nHTTP Clone URL: https://git.alex-detsch.de/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:  git@git.alex-detsch.de:some-group/some-project.git\nUsing LDAP:     no\nUsing Omniauth: yes\nOmniauth Providers:\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:        13.7.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default:      /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:              /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:            /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

The component is `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/vulnerability_count_list.vue`. Currently the `query` and its `arguments` are hardcoded in the component. If we slightly refactor the component to take a query and its arguments as properties we can reuse the same component. If the component becomes too complex for this, we can also create one component per dashboard. In any case, considering the effort needed for the implementation, I believe a 2 would be appropriate as weight.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T21:44:30.082Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T05:28:53.979Z","closed_at":"2020-12-01T05:28:53.895Z","closed_by":{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David

So a file containing 200k tests, will make 200k/300=**667** calls to redis.\n\nOn usage ping calculations, there will be an additional call to `PFCOUNT` to count the unique test case HLL.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\nIf the calls to redis are too slow or too frequent the redis instance could experience difficulties.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n* [Redis Overview Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/redis-main/redis-overview?orgId=1)\n* [Redis Logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/kibana#/discover?_a=h@7c049e4\u0026_g=h@e9f5e5a)\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n## Beta groups/projects\nWe will reach out to several smaller projects to enable this feature for them before turning it on for the main gitlab project, and ultimately the gitlab dot com instance.\n\n@zeffmorgan do you have any good ideas as to which smaller projects, using junit reports, could help us test this feature?\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Ensure https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44473 is merged\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with `#production` and `#g_delivery` on slack.\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [x] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n/cc @iamricecake","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T18:19:44.130Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T15:47:24.918Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T12:25:50.063Z","closed_by":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","analytics","bug::performance","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline insights","section::ops","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262092","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":12,"completed_count":12},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"12 of 12 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262092","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262092/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262092/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#262092","relative":"#262092","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#262092"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72206406,"iid":262086,"project_id":278964,"title":"[User Availability] Allow users to schedule un-setting of their status values [FE]","description":"This is the ~frontend implementation issue.

The ~backend implementation issue, which blocks this issue, is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326052\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe \"Days to completion\" scatterplot was added to group-level Value Stream Analytics under https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12078.  Currently this chart displays the *total* time spent in the given stage by all items that completed the stage on each date.  Using total seems fundamentally flawed.\n\nIf multiple items coincidentally exit the given stage on the same date, the value for that date will tend to be much higher than other values.  However, that high value does not indicate high or low functioning - in fact it is probably useless information because it cannot be compared to the other data points.\n\nMore generally, this chart was [originally described](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12078#days-to-completion) as, \"Essentially, the added value of all stages in Cycle Analytics for that date.\"  However, time does not equal value.  In fact, it is [obviously](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43446/diffs#note_418962804) more valuable to deliver the same work in *less* time.  So totals are possibly even counterproductive.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- The \"Days to completion\" scatterplot should display *average* time to complete the stage (not total/combined time).\n- This should be reflected in [the documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/analytics/value_stream_analytics.md#days-to-completion-chart) per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43446#note_424939811.\n\n### Related links\n\n- In #249803, @gweaver said: \"I don't really understand how this is being calculated or what it is telling me.\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T16:03:36.693Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T16:51:13.465Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T07:54:12.874Z","closed_by":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"},"labels":["devops::manage","frontend","group::optimize","priority::3","release post item","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"},"user_notes_count":42,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262070","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262070","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262070/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262070/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#262070","relative":"#262070","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#262070"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5272,"epic":{"id":188272,"iid":5272,"title":"[VSA] Usability improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5272","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72201822,"iid":262067,"project_id":278964,"title":"Global Search - Results (Vue Component)","description":"## UI Component\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-05_at_10.40.31_AM](/uploads/8b8bc0994310f7ea48858f6b90dbadeb/Screen_Shot_2020-10-05_at_10.40.31_AM.png)\n\n## Current Code\n\nContainer HAML: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/search/_results.html.haml\n\nNested Scoped HAML: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/app/views/search/results\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThere may be some hidden requirements in this component that won't truly be apparent until you start implementing it.  It's important to remember that the current **Nested Scoped HAM** is NOT scalable.  As we continue to grow the Search product it becomes increasingly difficult to manage this many partials that have their own internal design pattern.  The end result is very different UX between the different scopes' search results.  You can see this already by comparing the **Issues** search results to any other scope.\n\nThis component should aim to have **ONE** main result container that is data-driven and can handle all the different scopes in a consistent way.  This being said, the What to do may not fully cover everything but it should get you started.\n\n## Cleanup\n\n1. Move [_filters.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/search/results/_filters.html.haml) out of the `results` folder and up to the top level `search` folder\n2. Replace reference from `search/results/filters` to `search/filters` here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/search/_results.html.haml#L23\n\n## What to do\n\n1. Add HTML ID to the **existing container HAML** (this is where we will mount the Vue component)\n2. Create Vue components that will be replacing functionality\n3. Use shared Vuex store when initializing components created in `step #2` in [search/show/index.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/pages/search/show/index.js)\n4. **cleanup:** Can remove the (now old) [HAML partials folder (and all files)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/app/views/search/results)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T15:49:57.951Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:17:46.219Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T21:07:05.261Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","devops::data_stores","frontend","group::global search","javascript","section::enablement","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

By doing this we can begin to create a share Vue instance and Store without disrupting the majority of the HAML.  This shared instance will allow us to leverage the \"nice\" things about Vue and communicate between our Vue components asynchronously without the need of the rails controller and a refresh.\n\n## How\n\nWe create a top level Vue App that hooks in on the [show.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/search/show.html.haml).  It then passes the entire nested HAML as the Vue element.  Essentially what happens is we get a Vue app that fully wraps itself around the HAML.\n\nFrom here we create a Plugin that allows us to `mount` Vue components to locations in the HAML while preserving the rest of the HAML.\n\n## Is this different than how we _typically_ use Vue?\n\nThis is very similar to how we use Vue in most of our GitLab code base.  The main difference is that instead of initializing individual Vue instances for isolated components, we instead hook them directly to a functional Vue instance that sits at the top level.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T14:58:10.315Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:17:48.447Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T21:02:20.935Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"labels":["devops::data_stores","group::global search","javascript","section::enablement","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"}],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262058","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262058","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262058/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262058/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#262058","relative":"#262058","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#262058"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72197648,"iid":262056,"project_id":278964,"title":"Global Search - Dropdown Filter (Vue component)","description":"## UI Component\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-05_at_9.38.24_AM](/uploads/d9b7c4ca9ca904bc8877c58ee6cdeef4/Screen_Shot_2020-10-05_at_9.38.24_AM.png)\n\n## Current Code\n\nHAML: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/search/results/_filters.html.haml\n\nExisting Vue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/search/components/dropdown_filter.vue\n\n## What to do\n1.

We only can notice this with group access requests. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen a user requests access to a group, there should be a mail dispatched to the group owner.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nGitlab Omnibus installation on CentOS 7.8, Gitlab 13.3.6-ee and 13.4.2-ee\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\nProxy:          no\nCurrent User:   git\nUsing RVM:      no\nRuby Version:   2.6.6p146\nGem Version:    2.7.10\nBundler Version:1.17.3\nRake Version:   12.3.3\nRedis Version:  5.0.9\nGit Version:    2.28.0\nSidekiq Version:5.2.9\nGo Version:     unknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:        13.3.6-ee\nRevision:       d7bc82f4b06\nDirectory:      /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:     PostgreSQL\nDB Version:     11.7\nURL:            http://gitlab.example.com\nHTTP Clone URL: http://gitlab.example.com/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:  git@gitlab.example.com:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:  no\nGeo:            no\nUsing LDAP:     no\nUsing Omniauth: yes\nOmniauth Providers:\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:        13.6.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default:      /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:              /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:            /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\nChecking LDAP ...

It was highlighted during the review that the `:active` scope on the `User` model, and similarly the new `:without_bots` scope, can be problematic on GL instances as large as GL.com.  This was a known issue for the `:active` scope for a while as the `HistoricalDataWorker` is prone to time out on larger instances due to the query `User.active.count` ([originating from this code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/d25e82aae956103802543c2edd5166463039e145/ee/app/models/historical_data.rb#L15)).\n\nDuring the ~database review, it was suggested to use `Gitlab::Database::BatchCount` to count the active users in batches in order to avoid this timeout in this worker.  Then, we can use the count from `HistoricalData` to pull the active user count instead of calling `User.active.without_bots` ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42034/diffs#e726cacea6395b713543cf9931902d24dc44eda9_291_292)), which should be a much more efficient query.\n\n## Follow up\nThe following discussion from !42034 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @brodock started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42034#note_417765692):  (+12 comments)\n\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e explain SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"users\" WHERE (\"users\".\"state\" IN ('active'))  AND (\"users\".\"user_type\" IS NULL OR \"users\".\"user_type\" IN (NULL, 6, 4))  AND (\"users\".\"user_type\" IS NULL OR \"users\".\"user_type\" NOT IN (2, 6, 1, 3, 7))\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e Aggregate  (cost=312971.70..312971.71 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=98775.785..98775.786 rows=1 loops=1)\n    \u003e    Buffers: shared hit=399841 read=107791 dirtied=33650\n    \u003e    I/O Timings: read=93735.233\n    \u003e    -\u003e  Index Only Scan using index_users_on_state_and_user_type on public.users  (cost=0.56..296378.78 rows=6637166 width=0) (actual time=23.388..97786.319 rows=6783558 loops=1)\n    \u003e          Index Cond: (users.state = 'active'::text)\n    \u003e          Heap Fetches: 492659\n    \u003e          Filter: (((users.user_type IS NULL) OR (users.user_type = ANY ('{NULL,6,4}'::integer[]))) AND ((users.user_type IS NULL) OR (users.user_type \u003c\u003e ALL ('{2,6,1,3,7}'::integer[]))))\n    \u003e          Rows Removed by Filter: 4\n    \u003e          Buffers: shared hit=399841 read=107791 dirtied=33650\n    \u003e          I/O Timings: read=93735.233\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e Time: 1.646 min\n    \u003e   -

We are not utilizing the cache when we parse the markdown so we have to do it all the time, even if the content didn't change.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe `Banzai::Rendered.render` has an existing caching mechanism but it's not being utilized in `Projects::BlobController#show`. It can be used when `cache_key` exists in the `context` argument. The caching mechanism utilizes `Rails.cache` which will automatically expire after 2 weeks.\n\nUse the caching mechanism and set the `cache_key` based on blob's `id` and `commit_id`. This way, each version of the file can be cached when read.\n\n## Feature flag\n\nThis is introduced behind the `cached_markdown_blob` feature flag.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T13:21:00.737Z","updated_at":"2020-10-15T07:19:38.615Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T06:57:42.030Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/66118). Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217722) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T06:48:33.538Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T16:11:02.038Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T02:07:20.692Z","closed_by":{"id":4985794,"username":"cwoolley-gitlab","name":"Chad Woolley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf06f1fc667817854991b558103a9e2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","feature flag","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","missed:13.11","missed:13.12","missed:13.9","missed:14.0","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","tw-weight::3","type::maintenance","workflow::staging"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":4985794,"username":"cwoolley-gitlab","name":"Chad Woolley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf06f1fc667817854991b558103a9e2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4985794,"username":"cwoolley-gitlab","name":"Chad Woolley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4cf06f1fc667817854991b558103a9e2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262013","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":40,"completed_count":26},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"26 of 40 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262013","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262013/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/262013/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#262013","relative":"#262013","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#262013"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72161750,"iid":262011,"project_id":278964,"title":"Provide a Configuration option to prevent Maintainers from adding/editing environments to projects","description":"### Release notes\n\nIf you are looking for a way to maintain separation of duties in GitLab by using Maintainers and Developers, but are discouraged that Maintainers can add or remove environments, we have now have a solution!

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nCurrently, the Projects API has a beautiful way to `Get a single project`, as described [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#get-single-project). Through that API, a user can see lots of settings about a specific project, including Merge Request merge settings (such as source branch deletion after merge, merge method, etc). However, there's no place where the API shows whether a project requires, prevents, encourages, or allows the squashing of commits. This seems like a definite hole in the API response, and it would be helpful to be able to obtain this information from a single API command.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a user of GitLab and the GitLab API, I would like to be able to see whether a given project requires, prevents, encourages, or allows the squashing of commits from a single `Get a single project` API command. With this addition to the API response, users will be able to better tune merge request command-line tools to only set a new merge request to squash if the project itself allows the squashing. Personally, my command-line tool asks a user upon the creation of a new merge request whether they'd like to squash the merge request. However, the tool asks the same question even on projects where squashing the final merge request isn't allowed. Furthermore, if a project _requires_ the squashing of commits, then my tool shouldn't need to ask the user whether to squash or not; it should automatically fill that in for the user. With this suggested addition to the `Get a single project` API response, users (including me) will be able to improve their GitLab workflow automation, which companies and individuals continue to use and rely on every day.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\nPretty much anybody who utilizes the GitLab Projects API will be able to use this feature. This could include Sasha (Software Developer), Devon (DevOps Engineer), Simone (Software Engineer in Test), Priyanka (Platform Engineer), and others.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to use the [`Get a single project` API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#get-single-project) call to see whether a given project prevents, allows, encourages, or requires the squashing of merge requests. The API should give information that directly correlates to the project's settings as if the user navigated to this Settings page:\n\n![image](/uploads/5a8300d813a932778f7c0b15de1ebed5/image.png)\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nPerhaps, create a new version of the Projects API that would include the squash commits data as part of the response. I'd even be willing to be a testing subject for the new version on Beta mode. And then, in a blog post (or for my reference, as a comment on this Issue), release the new version of the API.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nNo further details. Please contact me if questions or concerns arise.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\nThere should be no impact to any members. If a member previously didn't have access to a project, then seeing whether a project allows squashing or not shouldn't be given via the API. If a user previously had access to see merge-related settings from the API, then they should be able to see this information, too.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\nI'm assuming that this change will require changes to the documentation. The documentation [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#get-single-project) will need to be updated, and perhaps in other places as well, such as [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/).\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nI don't believe that updating the API or creating a new version allows any risks of downtime or would risk the quality of the API. It could be worth adding additional tests to verify the new API is successful, and continues to present the existing information to users when used. This could probably be accomplished through end-to-end testing, but I'm not 100% sure without seeing the existing test codebase.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\nThe success of this feature can be measured by answering this simple question:\n\u003e If I use the `Get a single project` API as described [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#get-single-project), then will it provide an option to see whether the given project allows, prevents, encourages, or requires the squashing of merge requests?\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nI believe this feature belongs in the free tier.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

This is especially hard today when the list is 100's or 10000's of entries long.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Sort the context with modified metrics first, then new, then removed, then the unchanged.\n* Update docs to reflect new order and meaning of the labels.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nPremium customers interested in tracking performance and resource utilization.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-02T18:34:08.327Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:40:31.771Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T22:45:06.453Z","closed_by":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","SUS::FY22 Q1 - Done","UX","closed::complete","customer","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline insights","merge request widget","section::ops","type::feature","usability","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"}],"author":{"id":2578846,"username":"wchandler","name":"Will Chandler","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8b92738249753faee7055e021f8221?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wchandler"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/260388","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/260388","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/260388/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/260388/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#260388","relative":"#260388","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#260388"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5375,"epic":{"id":200562,"iid":5375,"title":"Verify:Testing - Visibility of system status FY22","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5375","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":72091946,"iid":260378,"project_id":278964,"title":"Free GitLab.com namespaces should display `Seats currently in use`","description":"## Summary\n\nWe do not show `Seats currently in use` for top-level namespaces which are on the Free plan.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution.--\u003e \n\n### Release notes\n\nGitLab has made it easier for you to build user management automation with a webhook that is triggered when a new member is added to a group. \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCustomers want to see when members are added to their groups.\n\nSome examples of why this is useful:\n* When a user is added, automatically grant access to specific subgroups or projects.\n* Ensure that users have the appropriate role. For example, no one other than a set of designated people should be group owners.\n* Capture the event in their own data store for auditing purposes.\n\nToday customers need to schedule calls to the API and therefore they don't get notified not immediately and so many API calls puts an unnecessary load on the system.\n\nCustomer Use Case:\n* Customer follows an inner sourcing model for the majority of their projects.\n* An internal SLA states that users should have access to all groups needed to perform their job within 5 minutes of gaining access to a system.\n* Today this need is met because all users that SSO in automatically have Guest access and have enough access to get started. The customer has created custom processes that calls the GitLab API and looks for any new user. If a user is found, their role is changed to Developer on the top-level group and they have access to the full group hierarchy.  \n* This customer needs to be able to hide certain groups (dark groups) from most users due to security/regulations. These groups are NOT in GitLab today but wish to migrate to it from another platform.\n* Using https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220203 , the customer can change their setup so that users have limited access when created and the dark groups can remain hidden. The customers automation would need to change so that users are added to each individual groups under the top level group except dark ones. \n* This setup will prevent them from meeting their internal SLAs since any post user creation automation will take longer than 5 minutes.\n* If a webhook was available for user creation, they could trigger their automation on that event instead of continuously polling the API. They could meet their SLAs and also greatly reduce the number of API calls they make to GitLab.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nGroup administrators should receive events when member actions are performed so that they can trigger their own automation!\n\n### Proposal\n\nDevelop a group webhook for Members. The webhook should trigger when members are added.\n\nImplementation steps: \n\n- [x] Add member_events column to web_hooks database table\n- [x] Add member events to webhook edit form UI\n- [x] Fire member events webhook when user added to group backend and specs \n- [x] Docs with example output \n- [ ] Enable feature flag for member events webhook so we can ensure it's not breaking anything \n- [ ] When we're confident it's working as expected, remove member events feature flag \n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

One is mandatory, the other two are optional. \n\nThis issue will focus on the required item, support for the `metadata URL`. \n\n### Proposal\nAdd support for v2 of Composer to GitLab Packages by adding support for the metadata-URL parameter. \n\n\n#### Metadata URL :package:\n\nThis is a new route that is required for V2:\n\n```\n/api/v4/groups/:id/-/packages/composer/p2/*package_name\n```\n\nThis new metadata-url should serve all packages which are in the repository.\n\nWhenever Composer looks for a package, it will replace %package% by the package name, and fetch that URL.\n- If dev stability is allowed for the package, it will also load the URL again with $packageName~dev (e.g. /p2/foo/bar~dev.json to look for foo/bar's dev versions).\n- Caching is done via the use of If-Modified-Since header, so make sure you return Last-Modified headers and that they are accurate.\n- Any requested package which does not exist MUST return a 404 status code, which will indicate to Composer that this package does not exist in your repository.\n- The foo/bar.json and foo/bar~dev.json files containing package versions MUST contain only versions for the foo/bar package, as {\"packages\":{\"foo/bar\":[ ... versions here ... ]}}.\n- The array of versions can also optionally be minified using Composer\\Util\\MetadataMinifier::minify(). If you do that, you should add a \"minified\": \"composer/2.0\" key at the top level to indicate to Composer it must expand the version list back into the original data. See https://repo.packagist.org/p2/monolog/monolog.json for an example.\n- If your repository only has a small number of packages, and you want to avoid the 404-requests, you can also specify an \"available-packages\" key in packages.json which should be an array with all the package names that your repository contain. Alternatively, you can specify an \"available-package-patterns\" key which is an array of package name patterns (with * matching any string, e.g. vendor/* would make composer look up every matching package name in this repository).\n\n\n\n### Future development\n\n#### New values in package.json\n\n##### providers-api \nThis optional field will be handled in a future issue. \n\n\"providers-api\": \"https://packagist.org/providers/%package%.json\",\n\nThe providers-api is optional, but if you implement it should return packages which provide a given package name, but not the package which has that name. For example, https://packagist.org/providers/monolog/monolog.json lists some packages which have a \"provide\" rule for monolog/monolog, but it does not list monolog/monolog itself.\n\n##### list\nThis optional field will be handled in a future issue. \n\nIt should accept an optional ?filter=xx query param, which can contain * as wildcards matching any substring.\n\nIt must return an array of package names as {\"packageNames\": [\"a/b\", \"c/d\"]}. See https://packagist.org/packages/list.json?filter=composer/* for example.\n\nIt should return the names of packages which names match the filter (or all names if no filter is present). Replace/provide rules should not be considered here.\n\n\n### Documentation\n- Update the documentation to say which versions are currently supported\n\n### Testing\nPart of the Package QA test suite,

Composer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297276)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-01T21:37:49.795Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T18:26:41.812Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T19:33:02.931Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve

There have been a few instances where a customer reports not seeing files in search, yet the project index status reports that the indexing has occurred. A manual reindex of the project has been shown to fix the issue.\n\nPreviously reported under: #250856\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\nWe have not been able to reproduce this locally. Though a few of the projects were imported, it's not definitely only happening to imports.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nProject data is partially indexed.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nAll files should be indexed correctly into Elasticsearch AND the index status should not be updated unless all files were successfully indexed.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259721#note_523934361 we should ensure we \"delete if exists\" the `IndexStatus` whenever we run [`ElasticDeleteProjectWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/591573d0f8bf311ac9f507182febe96b51688d88/ee/app/workers/elastic_delete_project_worker.rb#L14). Mostly this runs when a project is deleted so there won't be any `project.index_status`. But we can do something like `IndexStatus.where(project_id: project_id).delete_all` in this code to avoid this problem.\n\n\n### Workaround in the meantime\n\nAny project code can be completely reindexed by running the following (note that this can be slow for large projects as it reindexes every commit and file again):\n\n```ruby\nproject_id = # replace me with project ID\n\nproject = Project.find(project_id)\nindex_status = project.index_status\nindex_status.destroy\nElasticCommitIndexerWorker.perform_async(project.id)\n```\n\n#### Workaround for a whole group\n\nSince https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259721#note_523934361 implies that the problem is likely to affect an entire group we may want to index all the repositories in the group again. We should first check that the single project is fixed by the above before we do this since it is expensive for large groups:\n\n```ruby\ngroup = Group.find(\u003cID\u003e)\n\nproject_ids = group.all_projects.pluck(:id)\n\nproject_ids.each_slice(50) do |ids|\n  p ids # In case we fail half way through we have a trail of where we got up to\n\n  ids.each do |project_id|\n    project = Project.find(project_id)\n    index_status = project.index_status\n    if index_status\n      index_status.destroy\n    end\n      ElasticCommitIndexerWorker.perform_async(project.id)\n  end\n\n  sleep(1)\nend\n```\n\n### ZD Ticket (internal):\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/174790","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-01T17:12:09.236Z","updated_at":"2022-12-02T09:27:48.630Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T20:43:53.130Z","closed_by":{"id":4888751,"username":"changzhengliu","name":"Changzheng Liu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4888751/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/changzhengliu"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","customer","devops::data_stores","group::global search","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::enablement","severity::2","spike","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5708766,"username":"terrichu","name":"Terri Chu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5708766/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/terrichu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":11,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259721","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259721","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259721/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259721/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#259721","relative":"#259721","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#259721"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4855,"epic":{"id":141599,"iid":4855,"title":"Advanced Search administration and maintainability tasks","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4855","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72031597,"iid":259719,"project_id":278964,"title":"Verify and rollout `optimized_issuable_label_filter` feature flag","description":"## What\n\nThis is a placeholder issue to test and verify the performance of the label based search queries.\nThe optimization is currently behind a global feature flag (optimized_issuable_label_filter) which was introduced in !34503 (merged)\n## Owners\n\n- Team: group::optimize\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_manage_optimize`\n- Best individual to reach out to: ahegyi\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWith the optimized_issuable_label_filter feature flag, we expect that the response time improves when searching merge requests or issues by label(s).\n\nThe feature flag was enabled several times for shorter periods (SREs were involved in the first trials).

At first, this doesn't pose a security threat as such, but I couldn't find the mention of this permission in the docs.\nSteps to reproduce\n\n1. Make a private repository with 3 users (any user would suffice, 3 is minimum to show the bug)\n2. Provide one with guest access, and the other with the developer access.\n3. With the account granted with the developer access fork the repository.\n4. Using the guest account query for\n\n```graphql\nquery pathLastCommit($projectPath: ID!) {\n  project(fullPath: $projectPath) {\n            forksCount\n        }\n}\n```\n\n```\nvariables\n{\n    \"projectPath\": \"private_repository_name\", \n    \"path\": \"\", \n    \"ref\": \"master\"\n}\n```\n\nResponse\n```\n{\"data\":{\"project\":{\"forksCount\":1}}}\n```\n\n**What is the current bug behavior?**\n\nThe guest user can see how many forks the repository has had, can be used for side-channel attacks.\n\n**What is the expected correct behavior?**\n\nSince it isn't listed in the privileges for the guest user, it shouldn't be allowed.\nOutput of checks\n\n**This bug happens on GitLab.com**\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe guest user can see how many forks the repository has had, can be used for side-channel attacks. With known forks of the repository, it might be possible for the guest user to know any separate version of the code asides from the one in the private repository.\n\nPS: I reported this to the HackerOne platform and as it was rightly pointed out it is a bug would be better suited here hence the format.  \n\n**Possible fix**\nThe permission to access the `forksCount` as property should be removed, even with a very slight severity, I am sure this isn't intended behavior.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-01T15:22:50.182Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T20:55:54.436Z","closed_at":"2021-11-26T14:12:12.792Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"labels":["Deliverable","Eng-Consumer::Security","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","GraphQL","backend","devops::create","forking","group::source code","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":7147318,"username":"archerl","name":"Archer L","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f6cff490a28dcba5c1e8ec1de6a67ed0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/archerl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259693","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259693","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259693/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/259693/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#259693","relative":"#259693","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#259693"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7128,"epic":{"id":384256,"iid":7128,"title":"Security Engineering Allocation (Source Code BE): 10-NOV-2021","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7128","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72022713,"iid":259684,"project_id":278964,"title":"UX - Refactor DAST On-demand scan forms","description":"Follow-up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43660#note_421476578\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue describes the UX improvements suggested by @annabeldunstone with the existing On-demand scan profile forms:\n\n1.

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-01T12:41:05.873Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T14:50:19.740Z","closed_at":"2022-11-28T14:50:19.692Z","closed_by":{"id":12689435,"username":"timofurrer","name":"Timo Furrer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12689435/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/timofurrer"},"labels":["Category:Kubernetes Management","auto updated","customer","devops::configure","direction","documentation","feature::addition","group::configure","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
