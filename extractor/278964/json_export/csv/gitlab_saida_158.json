Whether the job is successful or not, the data left behind will eventually fill the disk.  For GitLab.com this has historically been resolved by having a massive NFS mount to the shared directory, and the appropriate cron job will perform the cleanup which applies to all sidekiq servers since the disk mount is shared between all servers.  This creates at least two issues:\n\n* Due to performance issues, the Infrastructure team has been trying to remove all NFS mounts.  With this removal, the sidekiq-import servers are slowly filling up their disk.\n* As we make the move over to Kubernetes, this will be more difficult.  All Pods do not run the clean up, and eventually those Pods will run the underlying node out of disk space.\n\nJobs should clean themselves after the data processing has completed.  This may require further investigation, however, the two identified queues that run our GitLab.com sidekiq-import fleet are the following:\n\n* github_importer\n* repository_import\n\nAfter a project import has been completed, data is left around on disk, which has caused deployment issues and will be an issue when these queues are migrated over into kubernetes. See the related issues below for more context and details.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. [ ] View disk space utilized on `#{GitlabInstallPath}/gitlab-rails/shared/tmp`\n1. [ ] Perform a project import\n1.

Generating one URL is quite expensive if we compare it to an average Redis cache call (fetching an integer value) which takes around 0.25ms.\n\nCulprit: `ActionDispatch::Jorney::Formatter#missing_keys`\n\n![missing_keys](/uploads/4632d53f6ec86c36df95cd3000730a46/missing_keys.png)\n\nImportant part from `missing_keys`:\n\n```ruby\n              unless /\\A#{tests[key]}\\Z/ === parts[key]\n                missing_keys ||= []\n                missing_keys \u003c\u003c key\n              end\n\n```\n\n* `missing_keys` method checks if all the required parameters are provided and valid.\n* `tests[key]` is the regex for `project_id` or `namespace_id`.\n* The regex is first casted to a string, then a new regex is created.\n* The regex needs to be compiled (I think the most time is spent here).\n* This process is executed for each link we generate.\n\n## Improvements\n\nTo reduce the computation time for the new regex, we should cache the newly created regex. This is tricky since the code is part of `ActionDispatch`. Performance after overriding (caching) the `missing_keys` method:\n\n```                                                        user     system      total        real\nproject_pipeline_url(project, pipeline)              0.396215   0.001382   0.397597 (  0.397596)\nnew_user_session                                     0.214758   0.006118   0.220876 (  0.220878)\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\nI'd expect a slight response time improvement (few ms tops), especially on large API calls (`per_page=100`) that contains generated URLS.\n\n## Risks\n\nOverriding framework code is risky. We should make sure that we have test cases for detecting changes in the framework code.\n\n## Involved components\n\nURL generation,

When user is invited as guest in private projects, user able to get the release information of the projects, but guest user cannot view the tag name and SHA of the commit in the release page or API. Recent update of gitlab (12.6), there is a feature to filter merge requests and issue based on releases. Turns out the endpoint to get the release name exposed the tag name and SHA to the guest user of private projects.\n\n### Proof of Concept  \n1.) User A create a private projects  \n2.) User A then create example tag/release in the project  \n3.) User A invite User B as Guest User to the project  \n4.) User B then access the releases.json endpoint, in this case : ```https://gitlab.com/jumbre/jumsol/-/releases.json```  \n5.) User B get this following response, which is exposing tag name and SHA commit used in the release (in Guest Role)  \n```json  \n[\n  {  \n    \"id\": 1160330,  \n    \"tag\": \"xzc\",  \n    \"description\": \"asd\",  \n    \"project_id\": 16040312,  \n    \"created_at\": \"2019-12-26T13:29:21.376Z\",  \n    \"updated_at\": \"2019-12-26T13:29:21.376Z\",  \n    \"author_id\": 4887622,  \n    \"name\": \"xzc\",  \n    \"sha\": \"51d3c429cc21be061a460ab8823e1e8e6be8cd04\",  \n    \"released_at\": \"2019-12-26T13:29:21.373Z\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"id\": 1160327,  \n    \"tag\": \"xxx\",  \n    \"description\": \"asdasd\",  \n    \"project_id\": 16040312,  \n    \"created_at\": \"2019-12-26T13:27:37.059Z\",  \n    \"updated_at\": \"2019-12-26T13:27:37.059Z\",  \n    \"author_id\": 4887622,  \n    \"name\": \"xxx\",  \n    \"sha\": \"51d3c429cc21be061a460ab8823e1e8e6be8cd04\",  \n    \"released_at\": \"2019-12-26T13:27:37.055Z\"  \n  }  \n]\n```\n\n## History\n\nIt seems this vulnerability was introduced by !18761 (merged). It doesn't filter out release properties by user permission.\nActually, we had exactly the same issue gitlab-foss#56402 (closed) in the past. We fixed the vulnerable API but seems the above MR introduced a new endpoint to expose release entries without proper permission check.\n\n## Impact\n\nExposed SHA commit of private projects to guest user\n\nBest Regards,  \n[@]rafiem","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-27T15:43:34.365Z","updated_at":"2022-07-04T17:10:01.757Z","closed_at":"2022-06-01T03:59:43.290Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Release Evidence","HackerOne","Next Up","Release::P2","Weakness::CWE-200","backend","bug::vulnerability","cicd::active","devops::release","group::release","priority::4","section::ops","security","security-backlog::valid","severity::4","type::bug","vintage","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/191332","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/191332","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/191332/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/191332/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#191332","relative":"#191332","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#191332"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29142460,"iid":191266,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove the branch pipeline with `build-qa-image` for merge requests","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21945 we moved QA and review jobs to be using `rules`, however that created an invalid branch pipeline for each merge requests.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22236 fixed the invalid pipeline, but there's still a branch pipeline with just a single `build-qa-image` job.\n\nIt's there because now `build-qa-image` has:\n\n``` yaml\nrules:\n  - \u003c\u003c: *if-canonical-gitlab\n    changes: *code-qa-patterns\n    when: on_success\n```\n\nWhich indicates that it should run for all branches.

It feel wasteful, to put process to sleep. I wonder maybe we can try to use `lease` mechanism here as well.\n\n### Possible solution\n\n- Reenqueue at a specific time immediately after the end of minimum duration.\n- Take another exclusive lease, open-ended, which expires exactly at the end of minimum duration.\n\nNote:\n\n[Sidekiq scheduled jobs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Scheduled-Jobs) introduces another delay that averages to the poll interval.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n### Checking for New Jobs\n\nSidekiq's scheduler is not meant to be second-precise. It checks for scheduled jobs approximately every 5 seconds by default (15 seconds before Sidekiq 5.1)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nA case where this matters:\n\n- There is a ton of work to do (backfill condition), therefore we don't really want to insert a lot of delay between jobs.\n- The job is performant, and even with maximum work to do, it always completes below minimum duration. Great!\n\nIf we ignore poll interval mechanics, we might think that with a minimum interval of 5s, the job will run every ~5s. But with a default poll interval of 5s, it would actually run closer to every 10s.\n\nTherefore we should subtract `average_scheduled_poll_interval` from minimum_interval. If the wait duration is \u003c 0, then reenqueue without a target time.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-24T02:07:32.212Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T08:49:46.509Z","closed_at":"2020-06-05T18:01:19.744Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["bug::performance","devops::systems","group::geo"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121697","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/121697","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/121697/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/121697/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#121697","relative":"#121697","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#121697"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29020940,"iid":121679,"project_id":278964,"title":"[QA] Enable K3d on CI/CD","description":"Now that https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19785 is merged,\n\nThe next iteration for QA using K3d is to enable this through CI/CD.

They have to create OOO using PTO Ninja, which will take care of setting Slack's status to the appropriate message that indicates the member is OOO during the OOO period, and then remove the status message when the person is back from the OOO.\n\n1. Setting both PTO and GitLab's status is a little bit of unneeded duplicated effort and is subject to human forgetfulness.\n\n### For MR authors:\n\n1. When they get a roulette suggestion for reviewer/maintainer, they'll need to check the suggested members' status on GitLab and on Slack (because one can forget to update GitLab's status) before assigning the MR to the suggested reviewer/maintainer. \n\n1. If the suggested members are OOO or at capacity, the MR authors need to search for another candidate that is suitable for the changes in the MR.\n\n1. If the MR author didn't pay attention to the suggested reviewer/maintainer GitLab's status and assign the MR to them directly, the MR will be on hold until the assigned member is back from OOO or until the MR author notice the delay and start investigating the reason behind it, then reassign to another reviewer/maintainer.\n\n### Concerns\n\n- If the suggested maintainer was available on the first roulette pick, then went on OOO, then they would still get picked for maintainer reviews.\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease describe the productivity problem that needs to be solved backed by charts from\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity-team/#engineering-productivity-team-metrics.\n--\u003e\n\n### Problem identification checklist\n\n- [ ] The root cause of the problem is identified.\n- [ ] The surface of the problem is as small as possible.\n\n## What are the potential solutions?\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease provide potential solutions here.

Rachel opens the GitLab app and navigates to their project.\n1. They navigate to `Releases` \u003e `Edit release`.\n1. In the `Edit release` form, they see a dropdown with the option to associate milestones to the Release.\n1. They can select an existing milestone from the dropdown, or search for all milestones (group \u0026 project level).\n  1. They can select 1 or N group or project milestones.\n1. Selecting 1 or multiple group milestone(s) closes the dropdown.\n1. Saving the form takes them to the `Release detail view`.\n1. The group milestone is associated to the Release.\n1. They can see the counter for closed issues in that given milestone.\n1. Rachel clicks the milestone name in the `Release detail view` and is taken to the `Milestone detail view`, where they can see all data for issues, merge requests, labels, etc. in that group milestone.\n\n### User stories\n\n#### Theme: Allow user to associate a group milestone in the **Edit release** form\n\n#### [🔮 See UX prototypes in the `Design` tab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121476/designs/group-milestone-1.png)\n\n##### Acceptance criteria\n\n- In the **Edit release** form, user should be able to see and search for group milestones in the `Milestone` dropdown menu.\n  - We want to reuse the dropdown behaviour being introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35265 -- show separators and badge counters for _project_ and _group_ milestones in the list.\n  - A helper text should be added below the existing form component.\n- Clicking a group milestone adds it to the selection in the dropdown.\n  - User should be able to add 1 or multiple project or group milestones at the same time.\n- All existing interaction in the dropdown selector stays the same.\n  - In the `create milestone` and `manage milestones` menu options, user should still be redirected to the **project** milestone pages. \n- When saving the changes in the Release form, user is taken to the Release detail view. The group milestone is now added to the release. \n\n#### Theme: Allow user to see a group milestone selection in the **Releases** page\n\n#### [🔮 See UX prototypes in the `Design` tab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121476/designs/group-milestone-5.png)\n\n- When associating 1 or multiple project milestones to a release, user should see the information reflected in the Release item (overview **and** detail page).\n- User should see:\n  - The group milestone name (clickable) in the UI.\n      - Clicking the group milestone name in the Release overview/detail page should take the user to the group milestone detail view.\n  - The data for closed issues from the milestone accounted in the progress bar.\n  - The issues counter for all the milestones associated to the release.\n- When a combination of group and project milestones are associated to a release, the counters should calculate them accordingly.\n  - Issues that are added to a group milestone and a project milestone at the same time should be calculated only once in the counter/progress bar.\n\n#### Issue breakdown\n\n~frontend \n\n* [Add Group milestones API (GET) methods to api.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232520)\n* [Update Release pages Vuex stores to handle Group milestones assocaited with a release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232530)\n* [Update the milestone dropdown combobox to display separated sections and badge counters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232569)\n* [Populate the milestone dropdown combobox on the Release edit/new page with Group milestones](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232577)\n* [Display group milestones on the Releases page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232581)\n\n~backend \n\n- [Allow for project releases to be associated with group milestones in the database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235387) **closed - duplicate**\n* [Support Group Milestones to be associated with Project Releases in API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235391) **completed**\n* [Expand Releases GraphQL endpoint for Group Milestone](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235494)\n\n##### Follow up\n\n- We need to make sure the issues counter should link to the `group issues list` if a group milestone is associated to the release item.\n\n#### Future iterations\n\nA few ideas of what could be included or looked at in future iterations:\n\n- Allow user to see releases associated to a group milestone in the Milestone overview page https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221223\n- Allow user to see releases associated to a group milestone in the Milestone detail page https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221224\n- Associate a milestone to a release when creating a New Release item (create release form) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214244\n- Associate a Releases to a group milestone from the Milestones UI https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221226\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

An additional query to the GraphQL will reveal the private program, the issue name and issue number.\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \nAs victim create two projects (one private and one public). As attacker create an issue in the public project.\n\nNow, if the victim moves  the issue to a private project, the attacker will have access to the private project namespace, but also will be able to gather information about the new issue by simply querying the GraphQL API\n\n### Impact  \nThis attack, will let an attacker to reveal the name of a private project, including issue name and issue number.\n\nThis scenario only seems to happen, when the new issue remains confidential in a private program. If the issue becomes non-confidential but still belongs to a private program. Then the GraphQL endpoint will return different information.\n\n### Example  \nFor exploiting this vulnerability, lets gonna use two different accounts:\n\n* `victim@gitlab.com`  \n* `attacker@gitlab.com`\n\nAs `victim@gitlab.com` lets create two different projects:\n\n* `0xroot/0xroot-project`: owner and public  \n* `sebasbf/private-program`: maintainer and private.\n\n\n![Projects.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/500200cd-a2ae-4ed8-b094-d9f83398ce70/Projects.png)\n\nThe account `attacker@gitlab.com` is a guest of the project `0xroot/0xroot-project` and decides to create a new confidential issue in the program, as shown below:\n\n![Projects_2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b0c58018-976e-4b7a-96fc-013a84b1663b/Projects_2.png)\n\n![Projects_3.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/f376f075-c142-46b5-8411-5ed17304eedc/Projects_3.png)\n\nGetting back to our `victim@gitlab.com` account. As project owner, we decide to move the confidential issue from `0xroot/0xroot-project` to the private program `sebasbf/private-program` and keep the issue confidential.\n\n![Issue_moved.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/2aa42443-8ab7-4daa-a0e5-838da69cdc80/Issue_moved.png)\n\nAs the attacker (`attacker@gitlab.com`), we will get the following notification in the issue ticket:\n\n![Attacker_Issue_moved.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/e467c016-c100-49a6-bd0f-de31f36a4e31/Attacker_Issue_moved.png)\n\nThis is something I wouldn't expect to see. As it reveals that the issue has been moved to a private program, including the program namespace and the issue number, which reveals information about a private program and how many issues have been created at the time.\n\nThis information, is no available otherwise through the web application interface.\n\nIf as an attacker, we decide to visit the victim's profile overview tab and the personal projects tab. We will see that such information about the private program is not public:\n\n![victim_overview_tab.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/55dc7e7e-0567-4706-b758-0666cc18a11f/victim_overview_tab.png)\n\n![Victim_personal_project_tab.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/95022322-99f6-4cd5-a927-7d29e18ccfae/Victim_personal_project_tab.png)\n\nAdditionally, if we open a a new graphql explorer tab as the attacker and submit the following query, we will gather similar results (please remember, that we are pinging a confidential issue in a private program, as we will get back to this later on):\n\n**GraphQL Query**:  \n```  \nquery HackerOne{  \n  project(fullPath:\"0xroot/0xroot-project\"){  \n    openIssuesCount  \n    nameWithNamespace  \n    issue(iid:\"4\"){  \n      state  \n      confidential  \n      description  \n      descriptionHtml  \n      discussions{  \n        nodes{  \n          id  \n          notes{  \n            nodes{  \n              author{  \n                name  \n              }  \n             bodyHtml  \n              project{  \n                path  \n              }  \n            system  \n            }  \n          }  \n        }  \n      }  \n      closedAt  \n      state  \n      webUrl  \n      webPath  \n    }  \n  }   \n}\n```\n\n**GraphQL Response**:  \n```  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"project\": {  \n      \"openIssuesCount\": 1,  \n      \"nameWithNamespace\": \"0xroot / 0xroot-project\",  \n      \"issue\": {  \n        \"state\": \"closed\",  \n        \"confidential\": true,  \n        \"description\": \"This is a confidential issue in 0xroot-project\",  \n        \"descriptionHtml\": \"\u003cp data-sourcepos=\\\"1:1-1:46\\\" dir=\\\"auto\\\"\u003eThis is a confidential issue in 0xroot-project\u003c/p\u003e\",  \n        \"discussions\": {  \n          \"nodes\": [  \n            {  \n              \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/IndividualNoteDiscussion/79a246bb9440d09f704c88e451f14285458f49e8\",  \n              \"notes\": {  \n                \"nodes\": [  \n                  {  \n                    \"author\": {  \n                      \"name\": \"Sebas\"  \n                    },  \n                    \"bodyHtml\": \"\u003cp data-sourcepos=\\\"1:1-1:34\\\" dir=\\\"auto\\\"\u003emoved to \u003ca href=\\\"/sebasbf/private-program/issues/2\\\" data-original=\\\"sebasbf/private-program#2\\\" data-link=\\\"false\\\" data-link-reference=\\\"false\\\" data-project=\\\"15883104\\\" data-issue=\\\"28720283\\\" data-reference-type=\\\"issue\\\" data-container=\\\"body\\\" data-placement=\\\"bottom\\\" title=\\\"Testing issue\\\" class=\\\"gfm gfm-issue has-tooltip\\\"\u003esebasbf/private-program#2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\",  \n                    \"project\": {  \n                      \"path\": \"0xroot-project\"  \n                    },  \n                    \"system\": true  \n                  }  \n                ]  \n              }  \n            }  \n          ]  \n        },  \n        \"closedAt\": \"2019-12-15T15:36:26Z\",  \n        \"webUrl\": \"https://gitlab.com/0xroot/0xroot-project/issues/4\",  \n        \"webPath\": \"/0xroot/0xroot-project/issues/4\"  \n      }  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```  \nAs you can see, the `bodyHtml` tag reveals a pretty fare amount of sensitive information about a private program for which I should not have access, including the `data-project`, the `data-issue` and the `data-project` tags.\n\n\nSomething that additionally caught my attention, is that if the victim set this new issue as non-confidential in the private program, the attacker will not have access to the information shown above. Let's see this with a practical example:\n\nAs the victim, I'm going to turn off the confidential attribute for this new moved finding into a private program:\n\n![Victim_non-confidential_issue_private_program.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ba5093da-6516-41b0-bb70-f39da2baa305/Victim_non-confidential_issue_private_program.png)\n\nIf as an attacker I try to repeate the same GraphQL query listed above, the results may differ considerably:\n\n**GraphQL Query**  \n```  \nquery HackerOne{  \n  project(fullPath:\"0xroot/0xroot-project\"){  \n    openIssuesCount  \n    nameWithNamespace  \n    createdAt  \n    issue(iid:\"4\"){  \n      state  \n      confidential  \n      description  \n      createdAt  \n      descriptionHtml  \n      discussions{  \n        nodes{  \n          id  \n          notes{  \n            nodes{  \n              author{  \n                name  \n              }  \n             bodyHtml  \n              project{  \n                path  \n              }  \n            system  \n            }  \n          }  \n        }  \n      }  \n      closedAt  \n      state  \n      webUrl  \n      webPath  \n    }\n\n  }  \n}\n```\n\n**GraphQL Response**  \n```  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"project\": {  \n      \"openIssuesCount\": 1,  \n      \"nameWithNamespace\": \"0xroot / 0xroot-project\",  \n      \"createdAt\": \"2019-12-14T21:17:42Z\",  \n      \"issue\": {  \n        \"state\": \"closed\",  \n        \"confidential\": true,  \n        \"description\": \"This is a confidential issue in 0xroot-project\",  \n        \"createdAt\": \"2019-12-15T15:35:48Z\",  \n        \"descriptionHtml\": \"\u003cp data-sourcepos=\\\"1:1-1:46\\\" dir=\\\"auto\\\"\u003eThis is a confidential issue in 0xroot-project\u003c/p\u003e\",  \n        \"discussions\": {  \n          \"nodes\": []  \n        },  \n        \"closedAt\": \"2019-12-15T15:36:26Z\",  \n        \"webUrl\": \"https://gitlab.com/0xroot/0xroot-project/issues/4\",  \n        \"webPath\": \"/0xroot/0xroot-project/issues/4\"  \n      }  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, this time the GraphQL endpoint does not reveal any sort of sensitive information about the issue.\n\n### What's the current bug behaviour?  \nMoved confidential issues into a private program, lets an attacker gather sensitive information about the program name, the issues counter, the program creation date, and the issue's name. Which otherwise shouldn't be accessible.\n\nAdditionally, the web application interface shows information about a private program, which otherwise is not publicly accessible neither through the victim nor attacker overview activity tab.\n\n### What's the expected correct behaviour?  \nThe way I see this I would expect few things to happen:\n\n- If a confidential issue is moved to a private program, for which I do not have access. I shouldn't be able to query the GraphQL endpoint and gather sensitive information about that private program. This is something that is currently happening when the moved issue to a private program is no longer confidential. But if the issue remains confidential, the attacker will be able to extract such sensitive information.\n\n- Additionally, I would expect the user interface to do not expose information about the private program and the issue number that has been generated, if the attacker does not have prior access to that program. This is some sort of information that otherwise is not being disclosed through the overview activity tab in the vctim and attacker account. So, I would expect a behavior in the same line for the issue page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nPlease see the attached screenshots on the **example** section\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nThis is affecting the gitlab.com site\n\n## Impact\n\nPlease see the above description provided\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [victim_overview_tab.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/55dc7e7e-0567-4706-b758-0666cc18a11f/victim_overview_tab.png)\n* [Victim_personal_project_tab.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/95022322-99f6-4cd5-a927-7d29e18ccfae/Victim_personal_project_tab.png)\n* [Victim_non-confidential_issue_private_program.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ba5093da-6516-41b0-bb70-f39da2baa305/Victim_non-confidential_issue_private_program.png)\n* [Projects_2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b0c58018-976e-4b7a-96fc-013a84b1663b/Projects_2.png)\n* [Projects_3.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/f376f075-c142-46b5-8411-5ed17304eedc/Projects_3.png)\n* [Projects.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/500200cd-a2ae-4ed8-b094-d9f83398ce70/Projects.png)\n* [Attacker_Issue_moved.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/e467c016-c100-49a6-bd0f-de31f36a4e31/Attacker_Issue_moved.png)\n* [Issue_moved.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/2aa42443-8ab7-4daa-a0e5-838da69cdc80/Issue_moved.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-21T23:59:29.731Z","updated_at":"2020-04-29T12:54:16.312Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T16:13:05.648Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["HackerOne","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3860200,"username":"egrieff","name":"Eugenia Grieff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3860200/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/egrieff"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-03-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/120026","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/120026","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/120026/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/120026/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#120026","relative":"#120026","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#120026"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28970318,"iid":119451,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create a top-level Merge Request section under Settings","description":"## Context\nAs part of the UX Scorecard (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/441), a first usability test around GitLab's Merge Request page showed that the approval rules can be difficult to understand. We followed up with a usability testing study (ux-research#270) to investigate this further and uncover new insights.\n\n## Objective\nThe purpose of this issue is to ideate and propose an iterative improvement to the placement of the Merge Request approvals settings. Currently, they live under Project\u003eSettings\u003eGeneral\u003eMerge Request approvals in the left sidebar.\n\n## Proposal \n\n1. Move \"Merge request\" into own section in \"Settings\" called `Merge request`\n1. Remove the collapse/expand buttons\n2. Add dismissible alert in previous location (keep alert in product for 9 releases)\n\n\n\n![image](/uploads/66ffdc95ebf979cc0e1a865ed41f39d0/image.png)\n\nIn a follow-up issue, we should then also update the layout for better scanability https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325194, and add a link to this new section from within the Merge Request area https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325240.\n\n## Problem validation\nIn this study, finding the Merge Request approvals setting was challenging for users who aren't familiar with the MR approvals feature. This is partially due to the fact that there are some concepts that seem related in GitLab (e.g. roles, Code Owners, protected branches) and this can send them down various paths to locate it.\n\nEven the participants who were familiar with the approvals feature experienced hesitancy when finding the setting. This hesitancy primarily came from the fact that they weren't sure if they should look in Settings\u003eRepository or Settings\u003eGeneral\u003eMerge Requests. Some did not see the approval rules setting at first because it was lower on the page.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eQuotes\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n- \u003e P1: \"Having the settings separated always confuses me a little bit because I'm not sure if I'm going to find something under General or Repository.\" \n- \u003e P2: Immediately goes to Settings\u003eGeneral\u003eMerge Requests. He starts searching through the \"Merge Requests\" section first and then lands on \"Merge commits.\" He continues to look and then settles on the \"Merge Request approvals\" section. Thinks it's not intuitive because there is Merge Requests and Merge Request approvals. So he thinks MR approvals should be under the Merge Request section.\n- \u003e P3: \"The natural place is Settings\u003eRepository...\" He first searches in Repository settings then clarifies the task, then looks at the Merge Request section, then the Merge Request approvals section. Expected it to be found in Settings but didn't expect to see it under \"General.\" He'd expect to see MR-related stuff as a submenu.\n- \u003e P4: He hasn't set up this part but what he would assume is that he should go to Settings\u003eMembers. He assumes the maintainer role should grant permission to be a reviewer in here. He then considers going to Project\u003eMerge Requests and changing the MR Assignee. When I emphasized \"all\" he then thought he should bulk update the assignee for all open MRs. After receiving another hint, he then thinks to go to Settings\u003eGeneral\u003e Repository but he doesn't find it there. His last resort is to go to Settings\u003eGeneral and finally sees Merge Request approvals.\n- \u003e P5: He first checks the Merge Request page to see where he can configure MR approvals. He then moves on to Project\u003eSettings but he spends a lot of time scrolling around and looking for the right place. He notes that he missed the Merge Request approvals setting area because he hadn't scrolled down the page.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Solution validation\n\nThe proposal was validated in the research  around navigating to settings ([Insight](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/011ea00e-71fc-4dce-9562-438055b8e9e8/insights/present/c2cb4b10-8c22-4134-b222-a86790a4e81b)).\n\n## Links\n- Insights Epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2333\n- [🎨 Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/UWOCjijYIRVWSbo80xNFmQ/Settings?node-id=36%3A206)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-21T02:43:47.576Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T14:04:52.434Z","closed_at":"2022-09-06T13:20:08.228Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","SUS::Impacting","Technical Writing","UI text","UX","UX FY21-Q4","approvals","closed::complete","cm-scorecard-rec","devops::create","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::code review","missed-deliverable","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","missed:15.3","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","settings","severity::3","tw-weight::5","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},{"id":201566,"username":"annabeldunstone","name":"Annabel Dunstone Gray","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/85c0203926134720f9a9aa8c6e264c78?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/annabeldunstone"}],"author":{"id":1851795,"username":"katokpara","name":"Katherine Okpara","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1851795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/katokpara"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":84,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/119451","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/119451","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/119451/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/119451/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#119451","relative":"#119451","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#119451"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4843,"epic":{"id":140379,"iid":4843,"title":"Optimize the usability and information architecture of the left navigation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4843","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28966294,"iid":119433,"project_id":278964,"title":"Redact quick action on incoming service desk emails","description":"We gave permission to support bot user perform quick action commands on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21948.

Currently, at the Project level, Webhooks are nested under Settings \u003e Integrations. When navigating to this view, the first thing a user sees are Webhooks and then Project Services (which are actually the \"Integrations\") We already have an issue to update the nomenclature here: ([39129](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39129)) but the order in which the functions are presented can be confusing.\n\n2. Overall, the current Integrations view is lacking hierarchy and focus. There are a lot of actions a user can take and there isn't a clear flow or path to follow.\n\n3. When thinking about how Integrations and Webhooks will scale across an Instance, Groups, and or Projects, it seems like treating them as separate items will allow us to better modularize their functions and ideally make configuring them simpler for our customers moving forward.

Running 8 jobs instead of 203 in these cases can save a lot of money (e.g. even if the 8 jobs would cost 1$, we'd save between `50*(4-1)*20(working days) = 3000$` and `100*(4-1)*20(working days) = 6000$`).\n  - Of course, with this change, some of these pipelines would be fixed and a new pipeline would be started because authors need other jobs to run (e.g. tests or Review Apps), but in the cases where people don't really look at pipelines output or when a MR is ready to be merged, that would avoid unnecessarily running many jobs.\n- This gives a quicker feedback (approximately 25 minutes since `gitlab:assets:compile pull-cache` starts immediately) to engineers when their MR fails any Danger checks.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\n- Some people would argue that when their MR isn't \"ready to be merged\", they'd prefer to have the pipeline run so that they can gather all the failures in one go.\n\n\u003e Ultimately, if I am *actively working* on something, I don't care about anything Danger complains about. I care only about working code (which MR labels and commit messages are not a part of). I view Dangerbot as a \"fix before assigning for review\", as they are essential runs for reviewers, maintainers, and metrics.\n\n\u003e Danger fails on translations, for instance. But I generate those last because the text might change as we work through a feature and I want to just run it once. Having to always have new translations generated in order to be sure the tests are passing as you add new code can lead to more cycles. Likewise, consider the interaction with the 10-commit rule, review suggestions, and people who want to rebase once at the end.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-19T14:38:20.925Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T17:12:14.347Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T17:12:14.282Z","closed_by":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"labels":["Danger bot","Engineering Productivity","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backstage [DEPRECATED]","ci-build","ep::pipeline"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This means you have to run a pipeline which takes time and uses runner minutes.\n\nNow you can get the same rebase with `ci skip` functionality in the Merge Request to rebase your branch without having to run a pipeline.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nFor large monorepos with semi-linear branching and many devs working out of the same repo, rebases are quite common and cause the pipeline to run repeatedly which is not desirable.\n\nIt was already possible to skip the creation of a CI pipeline when using `ci skip` (or `skip ci`) [in your commit message](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#skipping-jobs) or by using [push options](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/push_options.html#push-options-for-gitlab-cicd) and [through the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#rebase-a-merge-request), but it is not possible to skip CI when rebasing through the UI.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the ability in the UI for the merge request widget to rebase without triggering CI. The rebase button when offered will be converted to a primary info split dropdown button with the additional options stating:\n- `Rebase`\n- `Rebase without triggering CI`\n\nNote: The ability to send in a `skip ci` flag on the api call for a MR rebase is implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/38141\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

The full details of the report have been moved to a [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118782#note_621678220) to keep the description uncluttered.\n\nThe worst vulnerability exposed by the report is that a maintainer can execute scheduled pipelines using another maintainer's `CI_JOB_TOKEN`. Fixing this vulnerability is addressed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328553 and will **not** be addressed by this issue. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118782#note_575544233 for more details.\n\nA lesser vulnerability is that Maintainer B can edit a pipeline schedule created by Maintainer A without Maintainer A's knowledge. This vulnerability will be addressed by this issue.\n\n# Proposed solution\n\nForce maintainer or above user B to take ownership of the pipeline schedule in order to edit it. If Maintainer A then wants to edit the schedule, they must take ownership again or pipelines will keep running as maintainer B.\n\n## Technical details\n\nDisallow updating schedules owned by other users, by making `owner_of_schedule` mandatory in `Ci::PipelineSchedulePolicy` =\u003e `:update_pipeline_schedule`. Move `update_pipeline_schedule` into a new policy block so that other policies are not effected by this change\n\n**Note:** this is a breaking change for the pipeline schedule [edit action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/pipeline_schedules.html#edit-a-pipeline-schedule) in the REST API. Because it is a ~security fix, the breaking change should be communicated in a security blog post with the release of the fix and not before\n\nRelated Security Issue:
