The feature flag check remains, so that *replication* can be quickly and easily disabled in case a customer does not need to replicate this resource, or in case there is a serious bug or infrastructure problem causing excessive replication errors.\n\nAt the moment, there is no way to specify that the GraphQL field's feature flag should default enabled. Additionally, there is no need to disable the GraphQL API field, regardless of this feature flag, now that the feature is released. It just exposes the `package_file_registry` table.\n\nWhen we defaulted package file replication on in 13.1 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34702, we should have permanently enabled the corresponding GraphQL field.\n\n(We *could* modify GitLab's GraphQL code to allow us to default the field on, but the purpose of leaving these SSF feature flags in and defaulting them on is to allow disabling of *replication*.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Additional details\n* This text was added since the mockups were created:  \n![image](/uploads/622df555ffab306a586648030911d82d/image.png)\n\n* `Cancel` button needs to be added to the `Import group` view, similar to the `Create group` page:  \n![image](/uploads/77ed452cd777bf16e836f04a8a808f5a/image.png)\n\n* `Beta` warning and badge were added since the mockups were created and need to be preserved in the new view:  \n![image](/uploads/fcc92a97324a26c9db0de23f15a1d775/image.png)\n\n* `Invite Members` was added since the mockups were created and need to be preserved:

preserved.\n\n## User acceptance criteria\n\n* [ ] The new user experience looks like the mockups.\n* [ ] The breadcrumbs work as designed.\n* [ ] `Cancel` buttons work and take the user up one level in breadcrumbs.\n* [ ] Tab order works as expected on all pages. \n* [ ] Initial focus works as expected, focusing on the first input field on each page.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFollowing user docs need to be updated:\n* [ ] https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/\n* [ ] https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/import_export.html\n* [ ]

database migration testing prior to staging deployment","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nWe do not have a way to test migrations with production-like data.  Currently we have limited testing capabilities with #database-lab and in some cases some of our developers have an evaluation license to Postgres.ai.  Without the ability to quickly and consistently test against production-like data we are seeing migrations fail in staging and production.  Catching these errors at the staging and/or production level are much more costly than catching them at the development level.\n\n## Reach\n\nCatching these migration issues at the staging level are much more acceptable than at production.  However, catching at staging is still much more expensive than catching it in a developer environment.  Staging errors still cause escalations and require quick response.  \n\n## Impact\n\n1.5 Medium to high\n\n## Confidence\n\n\u003c!-- How do we know this is a problem? Please provide and link to any supporting information (e.g. data, customer verbatims) and use this basis to provide a numerical assessment on our confidence level in this problem's severity:\n\nWe have done a review of the last several reverted migrations and data size and integrity are a common theme.  High confidence.  Reference - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254811 --\u003e\n\n## Effort\n\nUnknown at this point in time.  We are working with Postgres.ai right now to evaluate whether this is an option to solve our ability for developers to test against production-like data. \n\n## Outcomes\n\n- Evaluate possible solutions (e.g. Postgres.ai)\n- Create rollout plan\n  - Research\n  - Evaluate cost\n  - Implementation\n  - Test\n  - Rollout\n  - Guidelines/Documentation\n- Create supporting issues as needed\n\n\ncc

When the project name loads, inspect the project name with Vue Devtools\n1.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nSupport versioning of the Terraform backend state for rollback or auditing purposes to drive the adoption of the GitLab Terraform offering.\n\n### User goals\n\nIaC project maintainers need to have access to previous versions of a Terraform state both for compliance and occasional debugging needs. \n\n### JTBD\n\nAs a Software Developer, I need a way to see previous versions of my infrastructure state, so that I can debug and fix infrastructure changes.\n\nAs a Compliance Manager, I need a way to see previous versions of Terraform state files, so that I have evidence about the state of infrastructure in retrospect.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n### User experience goal\n\nProvide an intuitive way to project maintainers to view the list of state file versions of a Terraform project. The users should be able to see the related `git commits` to the state file versions, number of resources created by the version and the Terraform version that the version was created by.\n\n### Proposal\n![Versions-default_data_values](/uploads/189ffecf19483be1ea7412e598abeba7/Versions-default_data_values.png)\n\n![Versions-default](/uploads/adc19413232c4764508570127e2a622c/Versions-default.png)\n\n![001_STATE_PAGE_ACTIONS_State_page-Versions-actions_expanded](/uploads/5089382bf53c8f7bae078aa3b33e6f64/001_STATE_PAGE_ACTIONS_State_page-Versions-actions_expanded.png)\n\n![004_Terraform-State_file_management-State_page-Versions-default-actions_hover](/uploads/bc9139076f9cff7a0cbe03a17141009b/004_Terraform-State_file_management-State_page-Versions-default-actions_hover.png)\n\n### Further details\n\nSupport for versioning of GitLab Managed Terraform states is provided from GitLab 13.4. Versioning is turned on automatically for new Terraform state files. Existing GitLab Managed Terraform state files will be [migrated automatically to versioned storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235108) in a later release. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/#gitlab-managed-terraform-state\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders -

that the `project_ids` parameter takes the `param[]=value\u0026param[]=value` approach.\n\nCurrently this feature is creating the endpoint to be like this:\n\n`https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/coverage_reports.csv?ref_path=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster\u0026start_date=2020-08-22\u0026end_date=2020-09-21\u0026project_ids=\u003cid\u003e,\u003cid\u003e`\n\nWhere the IDs are comma separated in the same parameter.\n\nThis causes the query parameter to be useless and the endpoint just returns the report for all of the projects in the group.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to a group's `/analytics/repository_analytics` page and click on the `Download historic test coverage data (.csv)` button.\n1. In the modal, select a couple projects in the projects dropdown.\n1. Click `Download test coverage data (.csv)`\n1. Select a different set of projects to download\n1. Click `Download test coverage data (.csv)` again\n1.

bootstrap modal trigger in app/assets/javascripts/blob/blob_file_dropzone.js","description":"We're in the process of migrating away all uses of Bootstrap.\nWhilst this is a simple task for things such as [buttons](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4001) and [alerts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4070), modals are much more complex.\nBecause of that, there will be no step-by-step instructions in this issue.\nThe goal here, is to remove the dependency on bootstrap in this particular file.\nHow you achieve that goal, is largely up to you.\nTake a look at the [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3963) and related sub-issues for discussions and examples of how others have tackled this problem.\n\n## Reasons we're doing this\nThe main reason for doing this is performance.\nWith modals in particular, this will be a two-fold increase.\nFirstly, removing any uses of bootstrap will allow us to remove bootstrap.\nThis saves file size in itself and also helps pave the way to removing jQuery.\nSecondly, a lot of these modals are troublesome.\nThey sit on the page, completely hidden and make all sorts of API calls to fetch data that may or may not ever be viewed by the user.\nLet's make GitLab smarter, and faster.\n\n## Things to help you\nThis js file uses `element.modal()` to trigger a modal.\nThe regex used to create this issue looked specifically for that selector.\nIt may be that there are duplicate issues for the same modal as the issues are created based on the triggers, not the modals themselves.\nWatch out for that.\n\nYou mission (if you chose to accept it) is to find the modal that this trigger, triggers.\nOnce you've found that modal, you have a few options:\n\n1. Migrate the modal and the surrounding code to a Vue application and use [`\u003cgl-modal\u003e`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-modal--default).\n2. Consider, \"does this even need to be a modal?\" if not, involve someone from UX to figure out an alternative solution.\n3. Consider, \"does this modal need to be here at all?\" It might not. Again, consult with UX (and possibly product) on this one.\n4. Come up with another solution that doesn't require creating a vue application. Just be sure to look at what others have done and communicate your plans so we don't re-invent the modal too many times. No one wants that.\n\nIf you have any questions, drop them in this issue. Or (better yet) hoist them up to the [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3963) so anyone working on other issues can see it too.\nHappy hunting!","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-21T15:36:52.416Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T05:11:05.130Z","closed_at":"2021-08-04T05:11:05.116Z","closed_by":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"},"labels":["component:modal","devops::manage","frontend","group::optimize","maintenance::refactor","missed:13.10","missed:13.11","pajamas::integrate","priority::3","section::dev","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"}],"author":{"id":1125848,"username":"samdbeckham","name":"Sam Beckham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1125848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/samdbeckham"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254280","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/254280","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/254280/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/254280/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#254280","relative":"#254280","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#254280"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4386,"epic":{"id":111701,"iid":4386,"title":"Modals \u003e Haml \u003e Remove calls to bootstrap/jquery","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4386","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71457837,"iid":254275,"project_id":278964,"title":"Replace bootstrap modal trigger in ee/app/assets/javascripts/main_ee.js","description":"We're in the process of migrating away all uses of Bootstrap.\nWhilst this is a simple task for things such as [buttons](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4001) and [alerts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4070), modals are much more complex.\nBecause of that, there will be no step-by-step instructions in this issue.\nThe goal here, is to remove the dependency on bootstrap in this particular file.\nHow you achieve that goal, is largely up to you.\nTake a look at the [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3963) and related sub-issues for discussions and examples of how others have tackled this problem.\n\n## Reasons we're doing this\nThe main reason for doing this is performance.\nWith modals in particular, this will be a two-fold increase.\nFirstly, removing any uses of bootstrap will allow us to remove bootstrap.\nThis saves file size in itself and also helps pave the way to removing jQuery.\nSecondly, a lot of these modals are troublesome.\nThey sit on the page, completely hidden and make all sorts of API calls to fetch data that may or may not ever be viewed by the user.\nLet's make GitLab smarter, and faster.\n\n## Things to help you\nThis js file uses `element.modal()` to trigger a modal.\nThe regex used to create this issue looked specifically for that selector.\nIt may be that there are duplicate issues for the same modal as the issues are created based on the triggers, not the modals themselves.\nWatch out for that.\n\nYou mission (if you chose to accept it) is to find the modal that this trigger, triggers.\nOnce you've found that modal, you have a few options:\n\n1.

We want to consider the way that the announcement affects open source projects and contributors. See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/packaging-and-pricing/pricing-handbook/-/issues/204 \n\nUnfortunately, having `[effectively] unlimited CI mins for public projects` be classified as a `bug` makes it seem like the bug can be fixed at any time without sufficient warning to users. \n\nIn summary, these are the challenges associated with calling this a `bug`: \n * **No visibility on CI minute usage by public projects.** CI minutes continue to not be counted for public projects and this means there is no visibility on how many minutes are being used. Projects can't make adjustments easily without this visibility, and we aren't able to inform any policies with actual usage data. \n * **Open source contributions are in jeopardy.** Some open source projects require that contributors test out their contributions using CI/CD before submitting ([see comment from user here](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/ci-cd-minutes-for-free-tier/40241/32)). Others like the [Samba project](https://www.samba.org/), a large and well-known open source project/community, would not be able to have open source contributions made to their project if the new limits apply to them ([see comment from user here](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/ci-cd-minutes-for-free-tier/40241/48)). \n\n\n### Intended users\n\nThe intended users would be, primarily, open source projects hosted on GitLab.com and their contributors. \n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

It would effectively be \"for display only\" as @fabiopitino mentions here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243722#note_415924742 \n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254231#note_638852313:\n\nToday the monthly charts will display the CI minutes consumption (in terms of credits/points) and not in terms of duration, because they are multiplied by the cost factor at the time the jobs completed.\n\nPerhaps we could add a new column in `ci_namespace_monthly_usage` and `ci_project_monthly_usage` to accumulate the \"duration in minutes\" for all projects/namespaces. This value would be reset automatically on a monthly basis and it won't be used to enforce CI minutes consumption since we already have a column for that that takes in consideration the cost factor.\n\n\nOnce we track the duration of all shared runners usage per namespace/project we can make better predictions on limits. E.g. A namespace using on average 1000 minutes would be billed as:\n\n* up to 1000 CI minutes if it uses only private projects\n* as low as 8 CI minutes if it uses only public projects (current cost factor of 0.008)\n* about 166 CI minutes if it uses only MacOS runners (assuming a cost factor of 6.0) \n\n\nWe need to:\n\n- add new column `ci_namespace_monthly_usages.duration` (or better `shared_runners_minutes_duration` column to differ from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338830)\n- add new column `ci_project_monthly_usages.duration` (or better `shared_runners_minutes_duration` column to differ from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338830)\n- track duration side by side to CI minutes consumption\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eDraft of a solution\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/ee/app/models/ci/minutes/namespace_monthly_usage.rb b/ee/app/models/ci/minutes/namespace_monthly_usage.rb\nindex 064355a4f03..4e55edc38ca 100644\n--- a/ee/app/models/ci/minutes/namespace_monthly_usage.rb\n+++ b/ee/app/models/ci/minutes/namespace_monthly_usage.rb\n@@ -27,13 +27,13 @@ def self.find_or_create_current(namespace_id:)\n         current_month.safe_find_or_create_by(namespace_id: namespace_id)\n       end\n \n-      def self.increase_usage(usage, amount)\n+      def self.increase_usage(usage, amount, duration = 0)\n         return unless amount \u003e 0\n \n         #

Instead, we should encourage this activity. We have heard from focus groups [and users on our forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/ci-cd-minutes-for-free-tier/40241/32) that sometimes open source projects require contributors to test out their contributions (run CI), which means some Free users will need to use up their own CI mins.\n\n 1. **Fix this bug.** It's useful for everyone (including us), to understand how many CI minutes are being used by public projects. People can't make adjustments easily if they don't have visibility into how many CI minutes they are using. When we fix this bug, we should not enforce CI minute limits on public projects for at least 3 months, if at all, in order to allow people and projects to adjust. (Deciding on the amount of time we allow for transition, if relevant, should be part of step 1)\n\n 1. **Enforce limits.** We should enforce our policy only once step 1 and 2 are complete and there has been sufficient adjustment time permitted.\n\n\n### Summary of analysis to date (revised 2020-10-30):\n\n- The data sources in Sisense  for the cost impact estimates are:\n  - [GitLab.com est runner cost public](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/690666/WIP:-GitLab.com-CI-Cost-Stats?widget=9846310\u0026udv=1056738) \n  - [GitLab.com public ci minutes top namespaces usage](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/690666/WIP:-GitLab.com-CI-Cost-Stats?widget=10118364\u0026udv=1056738)\n- How to read the Sisense report:\n  - CI MINUTES: The total minutes used per plan per month.\n  - OVERAGE MINUTES: The total overage minutes incurred per plan per month. \n- Average  monthly CI minutes used by public projects in FY21 to date = 12.8m\n- Average monthly overage minutes used by public projects in FY21 = 11m (so the overage rate is at 85%)\n- Public projects in the free plan account for 82% of the overages.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nCode and Wiki search will now match documents on the underlying Git object ID.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nCurrently, whenever a user searches for a blob (repository or wiki search), we only match on the document's `file_name` and `content`[^1] for the search terms.\n\nAs Git is a content-addressable storage system, I think we should leverage that feature by allowing users to search for a Blob's object ID (oid), which represents uniquely the file's content, in full, as a single SHA (i.e. `ffded2bb9b398af20fbc2f3e11c74b546f4c9764`). This feature would be helpful for debugging purposes, whenever we want to ensure a document is present in the index.\n\nThe best implementation path here would be using a search filter, `blob:\u003cobject-id\u003e` or `oid:\u003cobject_id\u003e`.\n\n### Intended users\n\nI think this feature is mainly useful for debugging purpose, so Developers, Admins.\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe goal is to have a simple way to ensure a document is present in the index.\n\nSupposing the user has access to the document, running `git hash-object \u003cfile-path\u003e` should yield the Blob's object ID. Using this same object ID in the GitLab should result in that exact document, if it exists.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nInclude a way for users to search for a specific Blob object ID.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\nThere might be a case for a user to search for a specific file content across GitLab to scan for vulnerabilities in public projects. Keep in mind that the Blob's object ID will change *everytime* the content changes and there are most likely other ways to scan as such already.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.
