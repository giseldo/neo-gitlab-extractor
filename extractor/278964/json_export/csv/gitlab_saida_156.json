This is very useful for personas responsible for managing issues aggregated up to a Group level, for example a Program Manager who is responsible for all projects under a particular group. However, for personas responsible for managing issues at a project level, there's no Issue Analytics is not available for them at the project level.  \n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later. --\u003e\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* Project Manager\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nProject Managers need the ability to identify trends as it relates to the issues created within their projects. With the ability to see Issues created and closed per day, week, or month, they'll be able to determine:\n\n* resource loading for their project\n* potential roadblocks that may impact delivery of their project, features, etc. \n\nAlso, as Insights is a Gold/Ultimate feature, customers who subscribe to Silver/Premium don't have the ability to perform Project level analytics, for example, see a list of all issues created and closed per day, week, or month. \n\nLastly, provide the ability to create the issue analytics dashboard similarly to what is provided for creating the Insights dashboard with the .gitlab/insights.yml file. \n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a project-level Issue Analytics page. Mirror the existing group-level Issue Analytics page, but scope the page to the project level only.\n\n### Future iteration\n\n* Issues created and closed per day, week or month\n* Bugs created and closed per day, week or month\n* MR's created and closed per day, week, or month\n\nSee below mocked illustration.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_2.37.02_PM](/uploads/8e2156b6002743daf7449a023897744c/Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_2.37.02_PM.png)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nPermissions and security are consistent with existing permissions.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nThe customers comment:\n\n*\"It seems odd that issue analytics are only available at the group level.

The \"Showing N of M items\" text always displays \"Showing N of 0 items\"\n1.  At most 20 projects will only ever be displayed, rather than having an auto-loading infinite scroll (as in Operations or Environments Dashboard project selectors)\n\n![flameshot_2020-01-10_16_09_53](/uploads/33ece408aac4f4ea1bfc49be9c705a5b/flameshot_2020-01-10_16_09_53.png)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.  Access the [Instance Level Security Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6953) (should be available on next deploys to staging/production)\n1.  Click \"Edit dashboard\"\n1.  Start searching for any projects\n\n### Example Project\n\nSearching for `git` will probably yield a lot of results!\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe text \"Showing N of 0 items\" (for some N, depending on your search term) appears. It will only ever be at most 20.\n\n![project_picker](/uploads/0016fa835bd94e1998f465b0903884c7/project_picker.mp4)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe text \"Showing N of M items\" should appear, where N is *initially* at most 20, and M is the total number of matching projects. Scrolling to the bottom of the list should load the next 20 (if any), such that the text would then say \"Showing 40 of M items\".\n\nThe Operations and Environments Dashboards implement this behaviour as expected (apologies for poorly framed video):\n\n![operations_project_picker](/uploads/4ce648fba48d8392b7ebf1602badfc10/operations_project_picker.mp4)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis will be on GitLab.com on one of the next production deploys.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe ILSD re-used the existing [project selector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.3-ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/project_selector/project_selector.vue) shared component for this functionality. Between the time the ILSD was written and when it was merged into `master`, the above component was extended with infinite-scrolling behaviour. The Operations and Environments Dashboards were updated, but the ILSD wasn't (as it was behind a feature flag).\n\nThe fixes would be to:\n1. While fixing this let's also change over the pajamas drop down.\n1. Extend the ILSD's [project selector Vuex module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.3-ee/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/store/modules/project_selector/index.js) to include pagination tracking/info and a `fetchNextPage`-style action\n1. provide the total from the pagination information as the `totalResults` prop to the [project selector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.3-ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/project_selector/project_selector.vue) in the ILSD's [project manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.3-ee/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/project_manager.vue)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-13T12:02:35.305Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T17:18:13.414Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T08:44:51.608Z","closed_by":{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"},"labels":["Deliverable","UX","devops::secure","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::dynamic analysis","missed-SLO","missed:12.9","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"}],"author":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/196526","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196526","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196526/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/196526/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#196526","relative":"#196526","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#196526"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29540387,"iid":196525,"project_id":278964,"title":"Admin Area: Add Instance-Level Integration Settings UI","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2137, we need consistency to configure service integrations.\n\nThese are the current views:\n\n| Admin Area: Service Templates | Admin Area: Settings/Integrations |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_11.27.01](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/f1fab9160da74eeb48de35241ec6d382/Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_11.27.01.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_11.27.22](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/6256e7b99f95c7421a2537568abe671c/Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_11.27.22.png) |\n\n| Project: Settings/Integrations |\n| ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_11.26.41](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/dca9a598891e6974cb7e566d7b4ffbcb/Screen_Shot_2020-01-13_at_11.26.41.png) |\n\n\n### Further details\n\n*Service templates* will become service instance-level configuration.\n\nAs part of this issue, we have to investigate how to achieve UX consistency and create the appropriate ~frontend issues.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn the admin area, we have to move *Service Templates* to *Settings/Integrations*.

This means that when this project is imported into another, `go` will give it a pseudo version which is completely unrelated to the project's internal release versions.\n\nExample:\n\n```\ncat go.mod\nmodule gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/go-modules\n\n# install latest of package \n$ go get github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway\n$ grep sync_gateway go.mod\ngithub.com/couchbase/sync_gateway v0.0.0-20200108193823-e0ee69dd59b1 // indirect\n\n# try installing affected version by using release semver\n$ go get github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway@v2.1.2\ngo: finding github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway v2.1.2\ngo get github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway@v2.1.2: unknown revision v2.1.2\n\n# install the affected version by using commit hash at release\n$ go get github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway@35fe28e2c01c50335f26f7c757a8e5d127f61651\ngo: finding github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway 35fe28e2c01c50335f26f7c757a8e5d127f61651\n[snip other lines]\n$ grep sync_gateway go.mod\ngithub.com/couchbase/sync_gateway v0.0.0-20181203170340-35fe28e2c01c \n```\n\nThe version in `go.mod` (35fe28e2c01c) will actually be the affected version documented in the advisory (2.1.2), but we wouldn't be able to match this. The version used by `go` is not linked to the project's internal releases until they switch to `go modules` and version their `go.mod` appropriately.\n\nSupporting the pseudo version, as well as the project-reported version, in `gemnasium-db` may be the solution to this problem. There are two options we could explore:\n\n1. Use a separate field for advisories to store the pseudo-version ranges\n1. Use the `affected_range` advisory field to store the pseudo-version ranges\n\nThe second option seems preferable as it would not require any schema change. However, irrespective of the approach we are taking, there are some potential pitfalls we have to consider:\n\n1. Does `date(versionA) \u003c date(versionB)` imply that `versionB \u003e versionA`? If this is not guaranteed, we may run into problems when comparing two untagged versions where only the date can be used for comparison `v0.0.0-20181203170340-35fe28e2c01c\u003e=v0.0.0-20181204170340-35fe28e2c01c`.\n1. Could a release originate from a feature branch and what are the possible implications when it comes to version matching? \n1. Pseudo version used by Go do not adhere to the semver specification https://semver.org so we have to make sure that they can be properly processed by the analyzer.\n\n# Useful Links\n- [Support go in

The Container Registry, follows the privacy settings of the project itself. For example, if the project is public, the registry will be public and if the project is private, the registry will be private. \n\nHowever, there are many use cases, where a customer wants to keep their code private, but the registry public. For example, if you are orchestrating a build process where you build docker images, store them in gitlab, and use a gitlab runner to deploy the image as a service to a docker swarm, the service will fail when migrated to a new node. The problem is that `CI_JOB_TOKEN` is very short lived, so it lives long enough for the initial deployment. But if/when any time passes and a different node in the swarm requests the image, the cached credentials (note `--with-registry-auth` was passed) have presumably timed out.\n\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Use cases\n- Keep the Container Registry public and the project private, to avoid having to explicitly login to Docker to pull images from the Registry.\n- Keep the Container Registry public and the project private, to share images within the organization without risking users making unexpected/wanted changes to the code.\n- Have a private registry and public project to prevent any unwanted updates to your important images. \n- Typically, you may want to share access to code, but prevent access to images, if your images contain initial passwords, API keys, etc. that are used to deploy web services. E.g., these passwords may be provided as protected environment variables. Anyone who downloads the image would be able to read these passwords.\n\n#### Implementation notes\nThis issue requires investigation and contains some unknowns. We will kick-off this issue as an investigation and then determine the feasibility of the implementation and solution after that investigation.\n\n\n### Proposal\nAdd a new GitLab API which will allow users to set and update their projects Container Registry to `public` or `private` so that they can manage the visibility settings independent of the rest of the project. \n- The user should be able to set this at the project level.\n- If it doesn't add complexity, we should consider adding project_id to give an extra set of controls. \n- The visibility of the registry should be completely independent of the project. So you can have:\n  - Public registry/private project\n  - Public registry/public project\n  - Private registry/private project\n  - Private registry/public project\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- This action should be limited to project owners/maintainers.\n\n\n### Documentation\n- Update the [Container Registry Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/) to include how to do this\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n- No foreseen impacts to availability\n- We will need to understand and implement the best default setting for the registry. \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like users have more control over the privacy settings for their projects.\n\n#### Metrics\n- Track number of projects where the Container Registry is set to public vs. private vs. protected\n- Count number of update events of this project setting\n- Understanding this data will allow us to potentially update the default setting in the future\n\n### Links /
