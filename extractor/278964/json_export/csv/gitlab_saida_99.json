[{"id":74161628,"iid":280951,"project_id":278964,"title":"Jira Integration - create issue in Jira using API","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps. They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\u003c!--\nA brief explanation of the why, not the what or how. Assume the reader doesn't know the\nbackground and won't have time to dig-up information from comment threads.\n--\u003e\n\nCurrently our MVC for Jira integration for Vulnerabilities is using special link generated in Jira that allows to create issue easily. However this method is no longer officially supported. We need to switch to use Jira REST API instead. The flow for the users will be very similar: users will click on button on Single Vulnerability page to create issue in Jira, then we will do the call to our API to start issue creation. When everything is ok and the issue is created, we are storing the internal link between Jira issue and Vulnerability and present that information for users. In case of failure we are responding with error message.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8942/designs/b1-details-page-jira-enabled.png\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8942/designs/b2-details-page-jira-enabled_issue-creation-state.png\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8942/designs/b3-details-page-jira-enabled_issue-created.png\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8942/designs/b4-details-page-jira-enabled_error-state.png\n\n\n## Relevant links\n\u003c!--\nInformation that the developer might need to refer to when implementing the issue.\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e)\n  - [Design 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n  - [Design 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n- [Similar implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/\u003cid\u003e)\n--\u003e\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8942)\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [x] Documentation: documentation has to be added,\n- [x] Feature flag: `jira_for_vulnerabilities` - disable issue creation when feature flag is disabled\n- [-] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated.

It is however present in our staging and production environments.\n\n### Cause\n\nThe index has been added in 2016 through a migration with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/211f019382c5e3fcf4812199aaf09b850eab09dd. However, the index definition wasn't present in `db/schema.rb` at the time. A guess is that functional indexes had not been supported at that time, but I'm not sure.\n\n### Impact\n\nWe've seen that a large installation heavily relies on this index. During the outage tracked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/2885, high frequency queries on the `routes` table had query plans with execution times up to 30s. With the index (and statistics for it) present, timings are down to only a few milliseconds.\n\nThe insight from this is two-fold:\n\n1. For self-hosted installations that were installed since \u003e= 2017, this index is not present. For large installations, this may have significant impact on database load and request latencies.\n1. For GitLab.com, we already know there are significant inconsistencies with respect to the database structure. This is being tracked in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3928, with index differences being discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271165.\n\n### Fix\n\nShip a database migration that creates the index unless it is present already. Make sure the change is included in `db/structure.sql` as usual.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-10T12:01:27.860Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:41:55.376Z","closed_at":"2020-11-13T17:51:20.024Z","closed_by":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"labels":["Category:Database","Engineering Allocation","database","devops::data_stores","group::database","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"}],"author":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280826","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/280826","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/280826/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/280826/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#280826","relative":"#280826","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#280826"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3928,"epic":{"id":81718,"iid":3928,"title":"Database Schema Validation - ensure the deployed database schema matches codebase expectations","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3928","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74142272,"iid":280825,"project_id":278964,"title":"Retire.js scanner - inconsistencies in report path depending on node_modules already exists","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nAs noted and discussed at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201857#note_415214148\n\nIt appears that there is an inconsistency with the [retire.js scanner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js)\n\nIf a project is scanned that has a pre-existing `node_modules` directory, an environment variable is set to report the full path https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/blob/master/analyze.go#L135\n\n```\nos.Setenv(\"REPORT_NODE_MODULES_PATHS\", \"1\") // make the convert function keep the file paths\n```\n\nLater used by the convert script\n\n```\n _, reportNodeModulesPaths := os.LookupEnv(\"REPORT_NODE_MODULES_PATHS\")  )\n```\n\nWhereas if the scanner itself prepares populates the `node_modules`, just the filename is given for the vulnerability\n\nNote that while undocumented, I found that even when node_modules is _not_ populated (as per a 'usual' scan), if the env variable is set `export REPORT_NODE_MODULES_PATHS=1`\n\nThen the full location is reported\n\n```\n\"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"node_modules/nyc/node_modules/lodash/package.json\",\n        \"dependency\": {\n          \"package\": {\n            \"name\": \"lodash\"\n          },\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\nUse a JS project eg. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm and run the retire-js scanner against this.\n\nNote the path given for dependencies in `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` eg.\n\n```\n      \"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"package.json\",\n        \"dependency\": {\n          \"package\": {\n            \"name\": \"lodash\"\n          },\n          \"version\": \"4.17.10\"\n        }\n\n```\n\nCompare this to a pre-populated run, eg. run `npm install` manually or as a before script\n\n```\nretire-js-dependency_scanning:\n  before_script:\n    - /usr/local/bin/npm install\n```\n\nNote location is a full path\n\n```\n      \"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"node_modules/lodash/package.json\",\n        \"dependency\": {\n          \"package\": {\n            \"name\": \"lodash\"\n          },\n          \"version\": \"4.17.5\"\n        }\n      },\n\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm for a test project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js for the scanner\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nPre-populated NPM installs show the full path in the dependency scanning report\n\nScans where this isn't pre-populated just show the local `package.json` in the dependency scanning report\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nConsistency, and the environment variable `REPORT_NODE_MODULES_PATHS` documented and supported\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise.

DoS","description":"**[HackerOne report #1029269](https://hackerone.com/reports/1029269)** by `afewgoats` on 2020-11-08, assigned to @dcouture:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nGitlab Webhooks do not properly obey timeouts, so connections can be forced to last forever.\n\nA malicious webhook receiver can respond in a way such that:\n\n1. The HTTP(S) connection between the Gitlab sidekiq process and the webhook server NEVER ends  \n2. Large amounts of data are kept in memory  \n3. Giant webhook responses are stored potentially causing processes to be killed due to out-of-memory\n\nIt\u0026#39;s not just project webhooks. Any use of `Gitlab::HTTP.post` such as system webhooks and integrations (e.g. Mattermost) are affected.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nA test webhook receiver is attached. It can be run with `node never-end.js` and serves on port 3000. If you want to use it, you may need to [enable local webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/webhooks.html#allowlist-for-local-requests). Instead, you can use my server at https://gitlab.example.com/never-end/ but **please redact all mention of my domain gitlab.example.com before publishing**.\n\nFirst, create a project.\n\n######  1. Never ending request\n\nCreate a webhook for the project with URL pointing to: https://gitlab.example.com/never-end/gitlab\n\nTrigger the webhook (e.g. by creating a new issue if that was selected as a trigger). Don\u0026#39;t use the webhook Test button as it times out after 60 seconds, so isn\u0026#39;t as badly affected.\n\nThe webhook server replies by sending 1 byte every 3.21 seconds. The read timeout isn\u0026#39;t hit because data is still being transferred, albeit very slowly.\n\nSee that:\n\n1. The sidekiq job never finishes (see /admin/background_jobs and screenshot)  \n2. A TCP connection from the sidekiq process to the webhook server is maintained forever. This can be seen with netstat or tcpdump.\n\nThe webhook can be triggered multiple times to have multiple concurrent connections.\n\n######  2. Several hundred MB of data, then never ending request\n\nChange webhook URL to: https://gitlab.example.com/never-end/mega/gitlab\n\nNow trigger the webhook and monitor the memory used by the sidekiq process. It will increase dramatically and stay high forever.\n\nThe webhook server replies by sending ~530MB of data and then 1 byte every 3.21 seconds. The read timeout isn\u0026#39;t hit because data is still being transferred, albeit very slowly.\n\nThe webhook can be triggered multiple times to have multiple concurrent connections and further increase the memory wastage.\n\n######  3. Several hundred MB of data, then request ends\n\nThis isn\u0026#39;t timeout related, but more to do with storing large webhook responses.\n\nChange webhook URL to: https://gitlab.example.com/never-end/mega/exit/gitlab\n\nThis time, the request will end successfully after a few seconds. The response size is ~530MB. It is stored in postgres in the webhook_logs table.\n\nGo to edit the webhook and scroll down to find the request in \u0026#34;Recent Deliveries\u0026#34;. Click \u0026#34;View details\u0026#34; (link to hook_logs) and it tries to show the full HTTP body. Puma worker is probably killed due to running out of memory.\n\nBy making several simultaneous requests to view the hook logs, my computer pretty much set on fire with all CPU cores at 100% so I had to force reboot it e.g.:\n\n```  \nfor i in `seq 1 15`; do curl \u0026#39;https://GITLABSERVER/gitlab-instance-027a8c7d/monitoring/hooks/1/hook_logs/3\u0026#39; \\  \n  -H \u0026#39;cookie: ...ENTER COOKIE...\u0026#39; \\  \n  --compressed \\  \n  --insecure \u0026gt; /dev/null \u0026amp;; done  \n```\n\nWhen I increased the response size of this endpoint to 666MB I got this error in postgres, but possibly just due to my setup:\n\n```  \nERROR:  invalid memory alloc request size 1073741824  \nSTATEMENT:  INSERT INTO \u0026#34;web_hook_logs\u0026#34; (\u0026#34;web_hook_id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;trigger\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request_headers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request_data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;response_headers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;response_body\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;response_status\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;execution_  \nduration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;created_at\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;updated_at\u0026#34;) VALUES (1, \u0026#39;issue_hooks\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;http://192.168.4.20:3000/mega/exit\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;---  \n     Content-Type: application/json  \n     X-Gitlab-Event: Issue Hook  \n...  \n```\n\n#####  Examples\n\nMost testing was done on my docker instance.\n\nI added a webhook to https://gitlab.com/afewgoatstest/mytestproject/ (not public) and launched a request: there is currently a never-ending connection from 34.74.90.72 to my server.

This properly fixes the permissions problem from the perspective of #262094.\n\nHowever they have noted that a guest user can still download the direct export of historic test coverage data via `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cGROUP_NAME_HERE\u003e/-/analytics/coverage_reports.csv?ref_path=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster\u0026start_date=2020-10-10\u0026end_date=2020-11-09` (note: `start_date` and `end_date` params may need to be updated to match an appropriate date range based on when testing).

As the guest user you will be allowed to download the data\n\nGiven that to fix #262094 we have [disallowed guest access for repository analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44721/diffs), we should probably disable guest access to this endpoint as well.\n\n**NOTE**: Although this issue is confidential, the fix does not need to go through the security process and an MR again be made against the canonical GitLab repository.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1.

duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nWe continue to poll on the job detail page even after the job is finished. The data we are fetching looks to just be the finished jobs data (which I'm unsure why we still need to poll for this). This leads to un-needed calls to our server.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n- Visit a finished jobs detail page \n- Check the network tab for continued calls \n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.55.46_PM](/uploads/8adab3e67204917cab91f895bbb647d6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-09_at_2.55.46_PM.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nStop polling the server for data once the job is finished.\n\nThis should be very similar to my work in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47301 except GraphQL is not involved and we are using our homegrown polling solution here.\n\nThe solution could be adding a watcher in `app/assets/javascripts/jobs/components/job_app.vue`. We could check the job status and if the status is one of our finished statuses we then should stop polling.\n\nLooks like we have two functions we should take a look at. `stopPollingTrace` and `stopPolling`.\n\n\n### Note\n\nWe should ensure if a job is restarted that polling is kicked back on.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-09T20:12:27.498Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T15:40:00.485Z","closed_at":"2022-04-18T03:04:27.581Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"ü§ñ GitLab Bot ü§ñ","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","auto closed","bug::performance","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","group::scalability","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We currently do this for groups and projects: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/notify/member_access_denied_email.text.erb\n\nFollowing the discussion here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/257880#note_442701950 , it would be good to add a \"Reject user\"/\"Deny user\" button on a user page when they're pending approval. Currently pending users can only be:\n\n* Kept in pending state indefinitely\n* Approved\n* Blocked\n* Destroyed\n\nWith the new \"reject/deny user\" button, when an admin goes to a pending user's page, they would see big straightforward buttons for \"Approve user\" and \"Reject user\", and it's clear the effect that clicking each button would have. \n\nWe could do something like this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/257880#note_443433469 , which is the boring solution that repurposes the \"Delete user\" action and renders a different box if the user is pending approval vs. a regular user. That way we don't have to build out a separate \"Deny user\" action so the work is pretty limited to frontend. \n\nEmail title: \n```\nGitLab account request rejected\n```\n\nEmail body: \n\n```\nHi (name), \n\nYour request to join (instance name) has been rejected. \n\nPlease (contact your GitLab administrator) if you think this is an error.\n\n---\n\nYou're receiving this email because of your activity on (instance name). \n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\n\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-09T18:52:36.102Z","updated_at":"2021-09-02T06:31:27.792Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T01:44:55.598Z","closed_by":{"id":5966677,"username":"serenafang","name":"Serena

Since the dependency proxy is at the group (or sub-group), you will need to use a group and not project deploy token. \n\n### Documentation\n\n[Update the dependencyu proxy authentication

`billing_email` in the API, since it is part of the `customer` on customerDot anyway. We also need to find a way for gl.com users to provide their billing email in GitLab if it should be different.\n\n#### Scope of the issue\n\nThis Issue takes care of the first part of the suggestion (`not sending along the `billing_email``) while leaving the second one (`find a way for gl.com users to provide their billing email in GitLab`) for later discussion. Given the undergoing work to move subscriptions management to GitLab, building a way to provide the billing address might not be the case at this point.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-09T09:11:39.133Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T13:54:39.829Z","closed_at":"2021-12-07T13:54:39.807Z","closed_by":{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo Gulina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28693a558066993ea93b7272208d285?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/agulina"},"labels":["Category:Purchase","Unplanned","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::purchase","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","wontfix","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo Gulina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28693a558066993ea93b7272208d285?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/agulina"}],"author":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":6348276,"username":"agulina","name":"Angelo Gulina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28693a558066993ea93b7272208d285?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/agulina"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280525","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/280525","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/280525/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/280525/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#280525","relative":"#280525","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#280525"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74069004,"iid":280521,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix various issues with vulnerability list when there are no vulnerabilities","description":"There are several bugs when the security dashboard/vulnerability list has no vulnerabilities at all (meaning there are zero vulnerabilities even with the filters removed):\n\n#### 1.

There is no pagination at all. Test report jobs with tens of thousands of suites just struggle to load at all.\n\nThe problem is more severe if the user has a less powerful workstation.\n\nThe problem was observed on Chrome, IE and Firefox, but it likely affects all browsers.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. View the test report jobs in any pipeline with thousands or tens of thousands of suite entries https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines/213414266/test_report\n2. For larger jobs, the browser will eventually give up:\n\n    ![Screen_Shot_2020-11-11_at_10.01.26_AM](/uploads/31a1ef83af7638d1d9041551404fed86/Screen_Shot_2020-11-11_at_10.01.26_AM.png)\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.

Split up the unit test artifacts into smaller suites in the pipeline. i.e. If you have one big unit test job that creates one big Junit report, instead break that out into ~2-3 smaller jobs with 2-3 smaller junit reports. This would allow you to view these test report jobs in the GitLab UI.\n1. Expose the report via the [artifacts:expose_as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as) keyword in the respective job in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, and then you would be able to view the raw XML generated in the merge request, as shown in this blog post [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/05/11/publishing-a11y-reports-in-gitlab-pages/#what-happens-now).

This will most likely drive the KPIs of my team.\n\nAs a developer leader I want to see that the team is improving by measuring the deployment frequency and comparing it over time (over sprints)\n\nI want to import the data from GitLab into an external monitoring tool, so I need API support to poll the data.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n* REST API and backend service to perform calculations\n* REST API documentation\n* GraphQL equivalent of the REST endpoint\n\nWe need to support `GET` API for this. As parameters there should be a configurable `timestamp` - the default time, if not set should be `30 days`. \n\nFor this iteration the API should return the deployment frequency for the project scope, but in the future we will add group level and instance level support. So this should be taken into consideration when developing this API.\n\nAlso in the future we would want to add support for the environment that there was a `deployment` to. In the true sense of DORA 4 - this is only meant for production, but there may be more than one prod environment and/or users may interested in non-prod environments  \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThere is another consideration: some additional work to create a data structure (tables) to store the metrics, and I think this should be designed so it is flexible enough to:\n\n* commonly capture the data for all metrics\n* support a view at Project or any level of Group\n* support a minimal time slice which could then be aggregated\n\nThis is one metric out of 4 so there needs to be a common API structure to meet all needs.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

This should occur when we lazily create new records for `Ci::Minutes::NamespaceMonthlyUsage`.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\nWe currently recalculate remaining additional/purchased CI minutes [in bulk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ffcbbe068cea1af7a2f19792d546b74f92e29e05/ee/app/services/ci/minutes/batch_reset_service.rb#L65). The logic is the same but needs to be done for the single namespace being lazily reset.\n\n- If the minutes consumption is greater than the monthly limit (`ci_namespace_monthly_usage.amount_used \u003e namespaces.shared_runners_minutes_limit`) (or default limit from `Gitlab::CurrentSettings`) and namespace has any additional minutes available (`namespaces.extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit \u003e 0`) \n- Then, update `namespaces.extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit` as the [difference between the minutes consumption minus the sum of monthly minutes limit and additional minutes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ffcbbe068cea1af7a2f19792d546b74f92e29e05/ee/app/services/ci/minutes/batch_reset_service.rb#L75).\n- Do that only if the [feature flag `ci_use_new_monthly_minutes`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341730) is enabled, to avoid double reset of `extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit`\n- Skip the recalculation of `extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit` in `Ci::Minutes::BatchResetService` if the feature flag `ci_use_new_monthly_minutes` is enabled.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-06T23:23:41.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T09:17:33.669Z","closed_at":"2021-11-16T09:16:15.018Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio

SMS and voice icons for paging notifications designs","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262729, we created designs for paging that require icons for text and voice messages. We don't currently have icons for those in the SVG library. This issue is for creating the necessary icons, and adding them in. \n\nHere is where the icons will be used (current icons are placeholder):\n\n![icons_needed](/uploads/e71d388b624e5d1e622876d014aab0ee/icons_needed.png)\n\n### Intended users\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\nHave clear icons to represent texting and voice messaging for the paging designs.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAfter discussing with Jeremy, we decided to use existing icons for this use-case:\n\nSMS messaging: [Comment dots icon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/blob/main/sprite_icons/comment-dots.svg)\n\nVoice messaging: [Mobile icon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/blob/main/sprite_icons/mobile.svg)\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.\nRead the descriptions on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels to find the correct ones --\u003e\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/AgTpI8QLUauzoO6kPPgTpX/Icons-for-texting-and-calling-and-277437?node-id=63%3A342)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-06T20:58:23.829Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T21:33:08.054Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T21:12:43.833Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["UX","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/277437","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277437","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277437/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277437/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#277437","relative":"#277437","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#277437"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73989630,"iid":277424,"project_id":278964,"title":"Store and track monthly usage of CI Minutes","description":"## Objectives\n - Store data about CI usage at monthly intervals with new tables/models\n - Track monthly minutes when a build finishes\n - Compare statistics between the the new tables and those in the current tables `project_statistics.shared_runners_seconds` and `namespace_statistics.shared_runners_second`\n\n## Technical Approach\nAdd `ci_project_monthly_usage` and `ci_namespace_monthly_usage` tables/models and track monthly minutes in there when a build finishes - this can be done in the background for the first month given that the usage would be partial.

@fjsanpedro\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe canonical link is generated automatically when the url ends in `/`.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nMmm, the canonical link is not generated?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nManually visiting routes like `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/` and the canonical links is not in the HTML.\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [X] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n- [X] Test on staging\n- [X] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [X] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name true`)\n- [X] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` by pinging `@sre-oncall`\n  - In `#g_delivery` by pinging `@release-managers`\n- [X] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [X] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [x] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set generic_canonical false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-06T09:20:57.875Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T08:21:29.332Z","closed_at":"2020-11-09T14:24:43.621Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco

They _should also be able to ensure that the Agent is working as expected and that its connection status is ok_. This activity stream will include GitOps events (e.g. how many files/objects have been synchronized with the cluster in each sync) as well as main events that are related to the Agent (configuration updated, token created, manifest added/removed) and errors/alerts for failures.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd an Activity tab in the Agent details page listing activity items related to the Agent. Below are event categories and examples.\n\nEvents are stored in the DB for 1 week.\n\n#### Token events\n\n- New token `\u003ctoken name\u003e` created by `\u003cuser\u003e` at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n- Token `\u003ctoken name\u003e` was revoked by `\u003cuser\u003e` at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n- (not sure we need it) Token `\u003ctoken name\u003e` was first used at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n\n#### Connection events\n\n- Agent status changed to \"connected\" at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n\n  On each call from kas to GitLab where kas passes an agent token, record the time of that interaction in the DB. This time is an attribute of the auth token that was used for the call. When time is recorded, check all valid tokens for this agent and see if the previous most recent call was more than N minutes/hours ago. If it was, record an \"agent connected\" event.\n\n- Agent status changed to \"not connected\" at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n\n  To do this we'd need to have a background job that scans the agents' tokens to determine the agents that had been inactive for some time. If such an agent found, record an \"agent disconnected\" even using the last activity time from the most recent interaction. It's probably not worth the effort, especially considering we (should) have similar functionality on the agent details page - we check all tokens of the agent to see if any of them have been used recently. I.e. we show current status vs an event+date when it happened, but this is probably good enough.\n\n#### Configuration events\n\n- Commit `\u003csha\u003e` was received by agent at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n\n  To do this we need to track if this commit has been seen by an agent already and only record an event when it happens for the first time. No need to do it per-Pod, right? Note that we are not saying \"configuration was changed\" as that may be interpreted as \"when the commit was made\", we are more explicitly saying \"an updated config reached the agent\".\n\n- Error: Invalid configuration in commit `\u003csha\u003e`, detected at `\u003ctime\u003e`. Message: some free-form text message like `invalid YAML at line 8 column 3` or `field bla is missing`, etc\n\n  To do this we need to track if we have published an event for this commit for this agent already to avoid duplicate events (they are reported by each agent Pod).\n  If we really want to we can make error messages more structured here rather than free form text. That way we can understand what it is programmatically, but that would require some effort, which I think is not justified at this stage.\n\n- Warning: Deprecated feature used in commit `\u003csha\u003e`, detected at `\u003ctime\u003e`. Message: some_deprecated_feature_name configuration section is deprecated, please migrate to new_feature. See `\u003clink\u003e` for more info.\n\n#### GitOps events\n\nThe feature is called GitOps and manifest projects are just that - projects with manifests. I think it might be better to use feature names for grouping.\n\n- Commit `\u003csha\u003e` was received by agent at `\u003ctime\u003e`. Sync started.\n\n  See notes for a similar event in the section above.\n\n- Commit `\u003csha\u003e` was successfully synchronized with the cluster at `\u003ctime\u003e`.\n\n- Error: Invalid manifest in commit `\u003csha\u003e`, detected at `\u003ctime\u003e`. Message: some free-form text message like `invalid YAML at line 8 column 3` or `field bla is missing`, etc.\n\n  See notes for a similar event in the section above.\n\n- Error: Failed to synchronize manifests. Triggered by commit `\u003csha\u003e`, happened at `\u003ctime\u003e`. Message: some free-form text message like `API server timeout`.\n\n- Warning: Deprecated Kubernetes feature used in commit `\u003csha\u003e`, detected at `\u003ctime\u003e`. Message: Object kind extensions/Deployment/v1beta1 will be removed in Kubernetes v1.x.y. Please use apps/Deployment/v1. See `\u003clink\u003e` for more info.\n\n  This is an interesting idea - to show things that might be of interest to the user that we notice when applying the manifests. For this particular example, it might be better to have a tool that is linting the files in the manifest repos as part of CI rather than on each sync. Anyway, there might be something that we'd like to bring to user's attention and we can use warning events for that.\n\n#### Future features\n\nFeatures we'll add in the future quite likely will require events on this page too.\n\n### Technical details\n\nTentative proto definition of an event:\n\n```proto\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\nimport \"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\";\n\nenum EVENT_KIND {\n  INFO = 0;\n  WARNING = 1;\n  ERROR = 2;\n  SUCCESS = 2;\n}\n\nmessage ConfigurationError {\n  string message = 1;\n}\n\nmessage GitOpsSyncError {\n  int64 project_id = 1;\n  string message = 2;\n}\n\nmessage Event {\n  int64 agent_id = 1;\n  google.protobuf.Timestamp happened_at = 2;\n  EVENT_KIND kind = 3;\n\n  oneof payload {\n    GitOpsSyncError gitops_sync_error = 100;\n    ConfigurationError configuration_error = 101;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nWe need to build:\n- a way to pass this information from it's source (`agentk`, `kas` or maybe the rails app in some cases) to some place for storage.\n- a UI for the user to be able to see it, _get notified of new important events_.\n- Hooks on events https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276248\n\n### User needs to be able to:\n* View events list in historical order, most recent on top (see event types above) from Agent details page\n* View details of event\n* See the connection status of Agent\n* Get notified of new `important` events [+what's an \"important\" event?+]\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nAll users should be able to see this page.\n\n### Links / references\n\n[Design: Cluster

Analytics] Allow filtering for \"narrow MR rate\"","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nGitLab uses \"narrow MR rate\" as its primary measure of throughput.  \"MR rate\" means throughput *divided by author count*, and \"narrow\" means \"limited to MRs authored by members of the organization.\"  (See [terminology definitions in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/merge-request-rate/#terminology).)  The ability to easily display \"narrow MR rate\" in GitLab itself would be quite valuable to GitLab.  This feature could be generalized to be useful to customers as well.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn MR Analytics, add support for \"not\" filters.  This will allow filtering for \"label != ~\"Community contribution\"\".  This approach will return consistent numbers over time, even as people join and leave the organization.\n\n### Alternative (more complex) proposal\n\nIn MR Analytics, add a filter for \"access level\".  The available options for this filter would be the 4 [Access levels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/access.rb#L14) starting from \"Developer and higher\".  Specifying one level automatically includes all higher levels.  The thinking is that Developer+ should all be members of the organization.  The downside is that if someone leaves the organization that would change historical numbers.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-06T00:58:09.930Z","updated_at":"2021-04-05T14:18:55.956Z","closed_at":"2021-04-05T14:18:55.899Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["devops::manage","frontend","group::optimize","priority::3","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":38,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/277296","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277296","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277296/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277296/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#277296","relative":"#277296","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#277296"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73945449,"iid":277256,"project_id":278964,"title":"Migrate find('#note-body') selectors to use a data-testid in rspec tests","description":"The following discussion from !46805 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @ekigbo started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46805#note_442083103):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e **question:** Are there any other selectors we could use?

Specifically, it is not possible to clear the cache via the API as described here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dependency_proxy.html.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n0. Ensure that `gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_enabled']` is NOT set to `false` and that Dependency Proxy is enabled in the test group on the web interface.\n1. Use the Dependency Proxy as describe here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/index.html#use-the-dependency-proxy-for-docker-images.\n2. Check the Dependency Proxy page for the test group on the web interface and see that the number of blobs has increased.\n3. Attempt to clear the cache using the API.\n4. Notice that the number of blobs does not go down.\n\nTo actually remove the blobs (workaround):\n\n1. Open the gitlab-rails console.\n2. Enter `@group = Group.find_by_id(group_id)` where \"group_id\" is the group_id of the test group.\n3. Enter `@group.dependency_proxy_blobs.destroy_all`\n4. Confirm that the number of blobs has gone down on the web interface.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n1. The Dependency Proxy feature is enabled even if not enabled in the gitlab.rb.\n2. The `::Gitlab.config.dependency_proxy` configuration lookup returns `\"enabled\" =\u003e false` even when enabled in the gitlab.rb and gitlab.yml files.\n3. Cannot purge the Dependency Proxy cache using the API\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n1. The Dependency Proxy feature should only be enabled if enabled in the gitlab.rb as described here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/dependency_proxy.html\n2. The `::Gitlab.config.dependency_proxy` configuration lookup should return `\"enabled\" =\u003e true` when enabled in the gitlab.rb and gitlab.yml files.\n3. Can purge the Dependency Proxy cache using the API\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![dependency_proxy_enable](/uploads/db2addd23f7aa7d2aeff561c4cf304b6/dependency_proxy_enable.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\t\tUbuntu 18.04\nProxy:\t\tno\nCurrent User:\tgit\nUsing RVM:\tno\nRuby Version:\t2.6.6p146\nGem Version:\t2.7.10\nBundler Version:1.17.3\nRake Version:\t12.3.3\nRedis Version:\t5.0.9\nGit Version:\t2.28.0\nSidekiq Version:5.2.9\nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:\t13.5.3-ee\nRevision:\tb9d194b6b91\nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL\nDB Version:\t11.9\nURL:\t\thttps://REDACTED\nHTTP Clone URL:\thttps://REDACTED/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@REDACTED:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:\tno\nGeo:\t\tno\nUsing LDAP:\tno\nUsing Omniauth:\tyes\nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:\t13.11.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

Then, install the packages whenever you need to use them as a dependency. However, if you use the Packages UI and another package manager format, you may have noticed that there is no easy way to quickly filter the UI to see only your generic packages. \n\nNot anymore. We recently added a tab to the Packages UI called `Generic` that you can click on and limit your view to only your generic packages. We hope this helps you to find and validate your packages faster and more efficiently. \n\n### Problem to solve \nGitLab launched the [generic packages repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/generic_packages/) in %\"13.6\" which allows you to publish and install generic binaries. However, when you navigate to the Packages UI, you can only see these files in the `All` view. This can make it difficult for you to quickly filter only on the generic package type. This problem is exacerbated in projects that use several formats in their registry. \n\n### Proposal \nAdd a tab `Generic` to the Packages UI so that a Developer can navigate to the user interface and quickly find and validate the package they are looking for. \n- Sorting, filtering, and deleting packages should all work the same. \n- Measure UI activity via Snowplow (similar to other formats)\n\n### Testing \u0026 Availability\n\nAnd end to end test is being tracked to cover this package manager.\n\n* General issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249575\n* Test case: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/1063\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-11-05_at_2.19.36_PM](/uploads/7efe449da8e79f6d54a43fd5c79eb324/Screen_Shot_2020-11-05_at_2.19.36_PM.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-05T21:18:58.185Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T07:09:37.347Z","closed_at":"2020-11-27T14:02:50.306Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Generic Package Repository","Package:P1","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","quad-planning::complete-action","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/277160","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277160","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277160/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277160/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#277160","relative":"#277160","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#277160"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4209,"epic":{"id":94932,"iid":4209,"title":"Provide Generic Package Repository","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4209","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73939428,"iid":277156,"project_id":278964,"title":"Extend AgentK to map NetworkPolicies and Alerts","description":"#### Implementation Plan\nMapping will be done for verdict `dropped` only (excluding `forwarded`).\n\n- [x] Extend [AgentK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/tree/master/internal/agentk) in order to map CiliumNetworkPolicies and Alerts instead of having the interaction on the level of `kubectl`.\n  - [ ] It might be worth to explore the use of [Informer](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/tools/cache/doc.go).\n  - [ ] The backbone of the implementation will come from [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/kubernetes/typed/networking/v1/networkpolicy.go) and [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) \n\n\n#### Additional Comments\n\nAt the moment only [git-ops](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) features have been implemented.

A new major version of all schemata are released.\n1. The resulting schema in [`dist`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/tree/master/dist) matches the implementation in the [PoC MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/merge_requests/45).\n1. Given the extra work required to remove the `type` property - which is required to unify schemata - this implementation is not dependent on it. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284063#note_449596263\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1. [x] Generate a new schema called `dist/security-report-format.json` under the [security-report-schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas) project. This potentially become the \"unified\" schema at some stage.\n1. [x] Update all schemata to have the new `details` field. This can be done by adding it to `src/security-report-format.json`.\n1. [x] Bump the patch version of all schemata ([SchemaVer addition](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu/wiki/SchemaVer#addition)).\n1. [x] Release new version.\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-05T19:19:33.128Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T14:58:05.483Z","closed_at":"2021-01-20T03:12:14.953Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueir√≥","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","backend","devops::secure","group::threat insights","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5721376,"username":"minac","name":"Mehmet Emin INAC","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d8bdee790902422e3554e411a173c7c0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minac"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/277119","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":4},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277119","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277119/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/277119/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#277119","relative":"#277119","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#277119"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4466,"epic":{"id":115454,"iid":4466,"title":"Generic security report schema","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4466","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73930845,"iid":277087,"project_id":278964,"title":"Duplicate asset links names are not handled gracefully in release UI and API","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nIf a user tries to create a new release through the **New Release** page and enters two asset links that have the same name, they get a generic error message:\n\n![image](/uploads/5ccb10abd878bc1050947adca22eaad7/image.png)\n\nHowever, this is **not** validated by the frontend, so it's unclear to the user what went wrong.
