Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops

Create a new group-level page /analytics/exec_dashboards.\n1. The new page will contain custom table view with multiple gitlab metrics.\n1. The API queries will be against gitlab-org production database.\n1. Each tile should have a drill-down link into other GL analytics reports.\n1. The new page will be behind a feature flag.\n1.

For this POC the measurements dimensions will be time period.\n1. Columns headers - Name | Period 1 | Period 2 | Change % | Description\n1. Timespan for the POC - 90 days\n1. Name - Metric name\n1. Period 1 - period 1 value. For the POC = Last full calendar month.\n1. Period 2 - period 2 value. For the POC = Previous full calendar month (-2).\n1. Change % - % = (Current period Value – Previous period value) / Previous period value\n1. Description - Open text\n1.

When you choose a value and then submit the form a message is added below the dropdown that says `Your status resets on 2022-09-08 00:41:43 UTC.` and the dropdown is changed back to `Never`. So then when the user comes back it isn't clear if your status will clear on the date or if it will never clear.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n- User sees `Clear status after` dropdown with options as they are today\n- User selects an option\n- If the user returns via the update status option they see a date or time as the dropdown text\n  - If the user chose a time (30 min, 3 hours, 8 hours) they see a time for example 3:30 pm EDT\n  - If the user chose a date (1 day, ..., 30 days) they see a date for example Oct 2, 2022\n  - This is just the display in the dropdown, the options would still be the same as in we **don't** need an option that displays Oct 2, 2022.\n- We could get rid of the helper text `Your status resets on 2022-09-16 15:18:24 UTC.`\n\n![image](/uploads/0fddc5f7cfeb772d3ac1f15f5a5b1ebf/image.png)\n\n### Availability and Testing\n- No new E2E tests or updates needed at this time.

This means we will need a `JiraConnectInstallation` record on .com and self-managed.\n\nThe installation record gets created with a [webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor/#lifecycle-http-request-payload) that we usually receive from Jira. With the proxy in place, the hook has to come from GitLab.\n\nThe hook contains:\n\n- A shared secret that needs to be stored and will be used to authorize future requests.\n- A JWT token\n\n### Problem with [asymmetric JWTs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/understanding-jwt-for-connect-apps/#verifying-a-asymmetric-jwt-token-for-install-callbacks):\n\nA public key is needed to decode the JWT in the installed hook. The key can be fetched from `connect-install-keys.atlassian.com/{{KEY_ID}}` and `KEY_ID` is included in the JWT's `kid` header.\n\nWe don't store the JWT token that was included in the installed hook to GitLab.com. So we have to construct a new token, but this won't match a public key at Atlassian.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe can offer an endpoint to fetch public keys from on GitLab.com\n\nThe security measure in asymmetric JWT is that the domain to fetch the public key is fixed. It points to `connect-install-keys.atlassian.com`. We can make this an application setting, so users can point it to `gitlab.com/-/jira_connect/public_keys` instead. This would require:\n\n* An application setting to configure the CDN URL\n* A DB table or Redis cache to store public keys\n* A route to return public keys","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-07T20:14:27.588Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T12:10:27.406Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T20:55:23.488Z","closed_by":{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Deliverable","Integration::Jira","Jira::ConnectApp","backend","devops::manage","feature::addition","group::integrations","missed-deliverable","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"}],"author":{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372967","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372967","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372967/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372967/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#372967","relative":"#372967","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#372967"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5650,"epic":{"id":230344,"iid":5650,"title":"Self-managed support extended to GitLab for Jira app","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5650","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":114607257,"iid":372964,"project_id":278964,"title":"Show Billing page to Auditor in read only mode","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nPer [our docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auditor_users.html#permissions-and-restrictions-of-an-auditor-user)\n\n\u003e Auditor users are able to have ... read-only access to all other resources, except the Admin Area [and Settings].\n\nSee \u00267469 for more details.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nAllow Auditor (in addition to Admin) to view Billing page in read only mode.

attacks are not sent","description":"\n### Problem\n\nEven if duplicate HTTP messages are filtered out when loading them from the database, as injections alter the attack request it is possible to have duplicates after injections are applied.\n\nDuplicate attack requests add to the scan time with no added value to the scan result.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDuplicate attack requests should be removed.\n\n### Example \n\nTwo requests loaded from the database may have the following URL:\n\n- `https://site.com/people`\n- `https://site.com/people?sort=name`\n\nWhen the request path injection location finds places to inject attacks, it returns the following (it removes query parameters):\n\n1. `https://site.com/\u003clocation\u003e`\n1. `https://site.com/\u003clocation\u003e`\n\nWhen an injection is applied, e.g. `../etc/password`, the result is duplicate attack requests.\n\n1. `https://site.com/../etc/password`\n1. `https://site.com/../etc/password`\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] The attack request factory can create an attack request from the crawledHTTPRequest, location and injection. It should return whether or not the attack request is a duplicate as well as the new attack request `Build(*HTTPRequest, InjectionLocation, Injection) (AttackRequest, bool)`\n- [x] The attack request factory should maintain an internal cache to see if the attack request has been seen before https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] Attack request can hash its fields (apart from ID). The hash can be used to determine uniqueness https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] Every time an attack request is created, update the cache https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] The cache should be maintained per check ID. That is, `map[string]map[string]struct{}`. This means duplicates are applied per check (different checks will apply different injections). i.e. `map[check.id][active request hash] = struct{}{}` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] The cache should be accessed using a mutex, or a concurrent map should be used for all cache maps https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] If the factory determines that the attack request has been seen before, then return `nil, true` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] Timing attack and match response attack should check to see if the attack request is a duplicate by reading the boolean value returned https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] The log in timing attack and match response attack should occur after the attack request is built. That way, nothing is logged if it is a duplicate. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/875\n- [x] Timing attacks should not send duplicate attack requests in the first loop https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/browserker/-/merge_requests/888#note_1135235031\n- [x] Exclude headers and authorization cookies from headers when

Currently, only a subset of these HTTP requests are searched, resulting in a significant amount of true-positives to be missed in the scan.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Record the order Navigations/Navigation Results are crawled so that active scans are more deterministic\n- Navigation Result HTTP messages should be retrieved based on the order they were crawled\n- Loading HTTP messages should be chunked, so that only 10 messages are loaded at a time. This ensures that memory usage is not excessive\n- The number of messages loaded at a time should be configurable by the user\n- HTTP messages should be filtered so that duplicates (by request method, URL) are not returned\n- HTTP message duplication removal should happen only once (cache)\n- Investigate the performance implicates of whatever solution is implemented\n\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Store a new field `CreatedAtIndex` on `NavigationResult`\n- [x] The `NavigationResultRecorder` should store an integer representing the order a NavigationResult is processed\n  - Each time a new navigation is created, increment the order\n  - Order should be accessed using a mutex\n- [x] Loading a navigation result from the database should return the order crawled\n- [x] The navigation result store should be able to return a HTTPMessageCursor (or iterator)\n  - The cursor contains a list of chunked HTTP Message IDs (chunked into size 10)\n  - The database transaction should be closed when the cursor is returned (i.e. don't have long lived transactions)\n  - Use a channel as a generator so that the following API works: `for httpMessage := range httpMessagesCursor.Read() {`\n    - `Read` hides the chunking, and retrieving from the navigation result store\n    - This should not require creating many goroutines\n    - Example: http://www.golangpatterns.info/concurrency/generators\n- [x] Remove duplicates as they are read by the cursor\n- [x] Cache duplicates so that getting another cursor only loads the required non-duplicate HTTP messages\n- [ ] ~~The chunk size is configurable by the user `ACTIVE_SCAN_LOAD_MESSAGE_CHUNK_SIZE=3`~~ we can do this later if required.\n- [x] Remove unused functions\n  - [x] `DatabaseHTTPMessageStore.FindAll`, `HTTPMessageQuery`, `httpMessageQueryBuilder`\n- [x] Only return messages that are not duplicates\n- [x] Only return messages that are in scope\n- [x] Remove `HTTPMessageStore.GetScopeService`, rename `DatabaseHTTPMessageStore.ScopeService` to be private, remove `httpMessageStore.ScopeService =` in test.\n- [x] Create a query for iterating HTTP messages from a navigation result","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-07T15:47:35.629Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T03:26:27.520Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T09:54:30.808Z","closed_by":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"labels":["Category:DAST","dast::browserker","devops::secure","feature::addition","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"}],"author":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372882","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":13,"completed_count":12},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"12 of 13 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372882","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372882/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372882/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#372882","relative":"#372882","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#372882"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5780,"epic":{"id":251193,"iid":5780,"title":"Browser-based DAST -

flag] Rollout of ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout the refactoring !97240 on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring` feature flag.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline authoring\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-authoring`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @furkanayhan \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n~\"group::pipeline execution\" `@fabiopitino` `@allison.browne`\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect nothing changes because it is just a refactoring change.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nWe can turn off the FF.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- Pipeline creation errors: https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=CreatePipelineWorker\n- We should not see a decrease of 201 response code of `Projects::PipelinesController#create` endpoint: https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7d638af810e4b002de03d9df7132175c\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring true --dev --staging --staging-ref`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_project_pipeline_config_refactoring false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-07T13:13:02.787Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T15:21:53.549Z","closed_at":"2022-10-05T16:46:36.428Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline authoring","maintenance::refactor","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372867","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":46,"completed_count":4},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 46 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372867","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372867/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372867/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#372867","relative":"#372867","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#372867"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":69697,"iid":84,"sequence":26,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-07-11T00:05:03.302Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T00:05:02.143Z","start_date":"2022-10-03","due_date":"2022-10-16","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/69697"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":114569677,"iid":372844,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add branch rules details to the list of branch rules","description":"### Description\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362217 we've added the ability to list branch rules under `Repository \u003e Settings`. \n\nCurrently, we only expose the `name` in the GraphQL endpoint, but the design requires us to also list branch rule details related to each branch rule.\n\n### Scope\n\nLooking at [`branch_rule_type.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/graphql/types/projects/branch_rule_type.rb) right now we only expose `name`.

the timing attack sends an attack HTTP request, the timeout should be used\n  - The attack timeout should take precedence over the default attack timeout\n  - The attack timeout should take precedence

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-05T10:27:52.181Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T14:20:00.723Z","closed_at":"2022-09-16T14:20:00.689Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["backend","devops::release","feature flag","feature::addition","group::release","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"}],"author":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372541","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":46,"completed_count":8},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 46 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372541","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372541/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372541/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#372541","relative":"#372541","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#372541"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":114434083,"iid":372537,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use `DestroyBatchService` in `Ci::Build#erase_erasable_artifacts`","description":"Currently, `Ci::Build#erase_erasable_artifacts!` uses `job_artifacts.destroy_all` to delete all artifacts within the build.\n\nGiven the intricacies of artifact deletion, we should avoid having multiple ways to delete a batch of artifacts and have a single service that handles this.

feature](ISSUE LINK) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Optimize\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_manage_optimize`\n- Best individual to reach out to: ahegyi\n- PM: blabuschagne\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nNo change in application behaviour.\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nNo errors were observed related to the `events` table.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nStatement timeouts, and slow database queries.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/api-rails-controller/api-rails-controller?orgId=1\u0026var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-controller=Grape\u0026var-action=GET%20%2Fapi%2Fprojects\u0026var-action=GET%20%2Fapi%2Fevents\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev --staging --staging-ref`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-02T15:43:28.669Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T10:44:12.585Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T08:10:36.923Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"labels":["backend","devops::plan","feature flag","feature::addition","group::optimize","priority::3","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372464","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":46,"completed_count":4},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 46 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372464","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372464/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372464/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#372464","relative":"#372464","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#372464"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":114357050,"iid":372455,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor Group, project and trial creation services during registration","description":"# Problem\n\nCurrently during registration we use the standard Group/Project creation services, along with the apply trial service and learn gitlab creation worker.

notifications to Slack App integration - Part 1","description":"## About\n\nThis issue is part of the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8670. See that epic for more context.\n\nWe have two Slack integrations that we want to merge into one: \n\n- [Slack Notifications](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/slack.html) integration (model: `Integrations::Slack`).\n- [Slack Application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.html) integration (model: `Integrations::GitlabSlackApplication`).\n\nThe Slack Notifications integration allows users to subscribe to events in GitLab and receive notifications of those events in a Slack channel.\n\nThe Slack Application integration allows users to use the features of the GitLab Slack App (currently limited to slash commands, but rapidly being built out!).\n\nWe want to merge the [Slack Notifications](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/slack.html) integration into the [Slack Application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.html) integration, so users need to only enable the Slack Application integration in order to use both the features of the Slack App and Slack notifications.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis kind of refactoring can uncover hidden complexity that _might_ mean the weight of the issue should be increased once it has started.\n\nIf it's necessary to increase the weight then please communicate this to the PM and EM on this issue.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe work for this is broken into 2 issues, with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373321 being the second part. \n\n### Backend\n\nAlthough this hasn't been technically verified, it should be possible to:\n\n- Change `Integrations::GitlabSlackApplication` to inherit from `BaseChatNotification`.\n- Share code between `Integrations::Slack` and `Integrations::GitlabSlackApplication` by wrapping the shared code in a new module they both mixin.\n\nThis would port the ~backend functionality of the Slack Notifications integration into the Slack Application integration.\n\n##### No-op when notifying\n\nFor this iteration, the actual posting of notifications to Slack will be a no-op (meaning, for this iteration the integration will not post a notification, but will still technically do everything up to that point), and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373321 will implement this next step.\n\n##### Feature flag\n\nThe change should be behind a feature flag that will not be enabled on production until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373321. The notification settings form should not display when the feature flag is disabled, so for this iteration, customers should see no changes.\n\n### Frontend\n\nTODO We need to understand the ~frontend part of this and the work involved in having the Slack Notifications settings display on the Slack Application integration form.\n\n### Design\n\n| Step | Image |\n|------|-------|\n| Put a warning

`Setting -\u003e CI/CD` on a group or subgroup page displays the error message \"There was an error fetching the environments information.\"\n\nThe browser console indicates that the error is a `404`

get a correct `200` response.\n\nIssue has been initially reported by a Premium customer: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/321375 (internal ZD)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAccessing `Setting

constructed incorrectly (missing `id`) when accessing  `Groups -\u003e Setting -\u003e CI/CD` (a \"There was an error fetching the environments information.\" error message is displayed in the

`rspec foss-impact` jobs has more chance to exit due to many test files detected (more than 20).\n\nTo solve that, there are a few options:\n\n- Make it run in parallel so it just works\n- Auto-detect this and run full FOSS by itself\n- Somehow work around this and apply the label, fail the pipeline early, trigger another one, etc\n\nMy preference would be to run `rspec foss-impact` in parallel because it would allow to catch failures that could potentially break FOSS `master`, without the need to run the full test suite \"as if foss\".\n\nI think it's better to favor `rspec foss-impact` over ~\"pipeline:run-as-if-foss\" (in terms of cost).\n\nTo optimize the number of parallelized jobs, we could use a child pipeline to dynamically set the number of nodes to run the job on.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-01T10:58:03.202Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T23:15:04.454Z","closed_at":"2022-10-10T09:19:38.536Z","closed_by":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy
