This needs to be backwards-compatible and not affect existing projects which may already have one of these pre-defined compliance frameworks associated with it.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Create a new ActiveRecord model to represent the custom \"compliance framework labels\" that will be created at the \"root group\" level.\n1. For each root group, create one \"compliance framework label\" record for each unique label name used by that group's projects (so there would be no more than 5 records created for each root group, because there were only 5 default labels).\n1.

This would be beneficial in a few ways:\n\n1. Promote consistency between the results of both methods.\n1. Reduce duplication of similar logic.\n\nWe chose not to pursue this in the MR in order to deliver the MR for the sake of efficiency, but this is still important to sort out.\n\n## Followup from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42026\n\nHere's an excerpt from [the thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42026#note_413972677):\n\n\u003e This method looks quite similar to the above method? Can we extract the common code for generating `HistoricalData.during(from..to)` here? The other method could just use the data in this method.\n\n\u003e They are slightly different but I wonder if there is a reason why the other one does `from ||= expires_at - 1.year` while this one is doing `license.starts_at`?\n\n# Proposal\n\nInvestigate whether it's feasible to reduce this duplication and reuse `in_license_term` in `max_historical_user_count`.  A key hurdle to this will be to understand why `max_historical_user_count` only looks back one year from the license expiration date.  Could we look back for the life of the license instead?  The `max_historical_user_count` method is used in a number of places so we'll need to be careful when changing this logic to make sure there are no undesired side effects.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

This appears to have added within the last week.\n\nFor Omnibus self managed installs typically we suggest for these limits to be disabled (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223718#note_382174618 for a similar issue) and for users to opt in rather than get stung as each customer will likely always have unique needs and have to customise limits anyways. For example any customer now wanting to run [GPT](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance) will absolutely hit this issue and make the process more complicated.\n\nLooking around I can see Infra were stung with this on .com last week and tweaked it back accordingly but I can’t find the specific issue or MR for the change itself ([although I found the MR to introduce the setting itself](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33215)).\n\nFor the reasons about this should be removed before it makes it into a

This issue will document the specific release processes of these projects and map them to existing Release Management functionality, as well a upcoming roadmap features.\n\n**For example**\n\n\u003e I’ve heard from some open source communities (like VLC and Ffmpeg) that they’d really like more CLI features on GitLab \n\nhttps://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C1BBL1V3K/p1600422045003900?thread_ts=1600350114.161000\u0026cid=C1BBL1V3K\n\n\u003e If GitLab introduces a workflow for single-patch acking, and a way to generate some reasonable history from a MR evolution, I can see the kernel moving to it.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/slpnix/status/1299274120081833984?s=12\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe projects to be considered are:\n\n- Fedora\n- VLC\n- Ffmpeg\n- Linux kernel\n- KDE\n\nSome of these are migrating to GitLab or considering to move to GitLab.\n\n- Fedora\n- KDE\n\n**Issue origin**\n\nhttps://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C1BBL1V3K/p1600350114161000\n\n## Reach\n\n\u003c!-- Please describe who suffers from this problem.

In particular Fuzzing and SAST. Several issues have requested the need to have a single URL to hit that contains a file download for the entire pipeline's artifacts aggregated from all jobs that contain a certain `report_type`. \n\n## Requirements\n\n- Pipeline API endpoint that allows for downloading a single file of all artifacts in a pipeline for a specific set of job that contain a user provided list of `report_types`. We have been using the `stage: 'fuzz'` field from `GET /projects/:id/jobs/:job_id/artifacts`, \n\n```\nstage: 'fuzz'\n```\n\nThis is fragile. We should move over to using `report_type` in our new implementation.\n\n## Endpoints to implement in graphQL:\n\n1.  Get list of all jobs in a pipeline that contain at least one of the report types defined in user provided \"report_types\" (Should only need pipeline ID and report_types and scope it by project id?)\n\n1.  GraphQL endpoint for downloading artifacts for individual jobs. (We only need a job ID to find this, can be scoped by project ID as well)\n\n**Not in scope for this issue**\n1.  GraphQl endpoint for downloading aggregated job artifacts in a pipeline that contain at least one of the report types defined in user provided \"report_types\" (Should only need pipeline ID and report_types and scope it by project id?)\n\n## File Naming\n\n- For the job artifact and pipeline artifact downloads, we should improve the file naming. Right now its just `artifacts.zip`\n\n- For job artifacts maybe something like `\u003cJOB_NAME\u003e-\u003cJOB_ID\u003e.zip`\n\n- For pipeline artifacts maybe something like `\u003cPIPELINE_NAME\u003e-\u003cPIPELINE_ID\u003e.zip` with sub folders inside of the format `\u003cJOB_NAME\u003e-\u003cJOB_ID\u003e.zip`\n\n\n## Support other report types other than just Secure\n\n- Attempt to make this work for all report types not just Security related report types.\n\n----------\n\nExample Screenshots:\n\n# Fuzzing\nIssue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210343\n\n![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e2de4be6fd76cdb26b3a0504b3c262ba/Screen_Shot_2020-09-18_at_1.15.43_AM.png)\n\nIssue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217151/\n\n![Pipeline_list](/uploads/5f8aa8bacebf0071a98b4fa624a026ad/Pipeline_list.png)\n\n# SAST\n\nEpic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4388\n\n![](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/uploads/466d8473b6bd33d970c74f61f9be5d5e/image.png)\n\n# Technical details\n\n## Backend\n\nThe frontend needs the following GraphQL query:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  project(fullPath: \"project-full-path\") {\n    pipeline(iid: \"the-iid\") {\n      jobs(securityReportTypes: [FUZZING, SAST]) {\n        nodes {\n          artifacts(types: [ARCHIVE]) {\n            nodes {\n              downloadPath\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      # reportsArchive(reportTypes: [FUZZING, SAST]) {  \u003c-- deferred to a future issue\n        # downloadPath\n      # }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following new GraphQL fields are needed:\n\n1. `EE::Types::Ci::PipelineType.jobs` that takes a `securityReportTypes` argument and returns all jobs with a report key that matches. Valid report types are any value from `Security::SecurityJobsFinder.allowed_job_types`, which should be created as an enum type `JobArtifactSecurityReportTypesEnum` so the frontend knows what values are valid\n2. `EE::Types::Ci::JobType.artifacts` that takes a `types` argument and returns artifacts of the given types. Valid values for the `types` argument are any value from `Ci::JobArtifact::TYPE_AND_FORMAT_PAIRS`, which should be created as an enum type `JobArtifactTypesEnum` so the frontend knows what values are valid\n3. A new `EE::Types::Ci::JobArtifactType` that has a `downloadPath` field that returns the path needed to download the artifact and a `fileType` field that returns the file type of the download artifact\n4. ~~`Types::Ci::PipelineType.reportsArchive` which takes a `reportTypes` filter and is a new `Types::Ci::ReportsArchive` type that has a `downloadPath`. That path will need to route to a new action that fetches the reports matching the given report types and zips them into an archive for download~~ (Deferred to a future issue)\n\n### Notes\n\n* ~~Currently, `Security::JobsFinder` can be used to fetch jobs from a pipeline that have a given Secure report type. This should be merged into `Ci::JobsFinder` so that `Types::Ci::JobType.artifacts(reportType: [])` can be used by other stages~~ This plan has been abandoned. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251015#note_3ca75c06cd0c677f64caccfcfce88652026492a5\n* Each of these fields should be resolved in such a way that no N+1 queries are created.

However, it does not currently display which image tags have been fetched, whether or not they are in the cache and how often they are used. This makes it difficult for the user to understand how effective this feature is and to validate that the correct image tags are being used. \n\n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\nAs users begin to adopt the Dependency Proxy, the UI makes it clear that the feature is working as expected and helps the user to understand which images have been cached and when. \n\n### Proposal\n- As a Developer, when I navigate to my group's Dependency Proxy, I need to see which image tags have been fetched from Docker Hub and when so that I can validate that the correct image was used and troubleshoot when something has gone wrong. \n- As a Developer, when I am looking at which image tags have been cached using the Dependency Proxy, I'd like to see meta data for the image, so I can understand how it was built. \n- When a user lands on the Dependency Proxy main UI, they can click on the npmjs.org(default) remote registry to view the details. That detail view will include a list of packages pulled from the default. From there, we could display which packages have been pulled, which of those are cached (and for how long), and a warning if any of those show security warnings.\n- (beyond the MVC) As an Admin, When I am trying to understand how my team uses the Dependency Proxy, I need to know how often image tags are fetched from Docker Hub, how often they are pulled from the cache and the ratio of those two metrics.\n\n \n\n### Further details\n- As discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241639#note_413250100, currently only the blobs are cached when an image is pulled, not the manifest. This will likely need to be resolved so that we can display meta data in the UI. \n- As discussed in this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215393 the design of the dependency proxy UI should also include an ability to flag possible security vulnerabilities being pulled in through the cache. So when an image tag is requested from Docker Hub, we also check against the known vulnerabilities database and include a warning in the UI. \n\n#### Metadata\n- Name\n- Tags\n- Copyable install commands\n- Downloaded date\n- Last used \n- Size\n- OS/Arch\n\n## Testing and Availability\n\nWe currently have an existing end-to-end test that [verifies the blob count](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/qa/qa/specs/features/browser_ui/5_package/dependency_proxy_spec.rb) on the Dependency Proxy. It is ideal that the test is updated to verify the image cached instead as it is available explicitly in the UI.

The integration initially created `file` type secret variables, and this approach had a few shortcomings. To overcome these we are introducing a new, boolean `file` keyword where you can specify if the returned variable should be stored as a plain environment variable or a file.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, the default is to store the variables as file types, that corresponds with setting `file:true`. At the same time, we recommend using `file:false`. We will likely change this default in the next major release.\n\n### Problem to Solve \n\nWe've recently added the `secrets:` concept to GitLab CI/CD - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218746#note_412577121. \n\n### Proposal \n\nAs it was discussed at the development time and was pointed again with the first feedback, the variable that is created after resolving the secret is of the `file` type. This requires additional preparation steps in cases, where the variable is supposed to be not `file` based and simply contain the value.\n\nThis was the design choice for the first implementation, but we've discussed the possibility for making this configurable. And it seems that it will be needed :slight_smile: \n\nThe proposal here is to:\n\n1. Update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` syntax to contain a `file: true/false` configuration setting on the secret level:\n\n    ```yaml\n    job:\n      secrets:\n        TEST_SECRET:\n          vault:\n            engine:\n              name: kv-v2\n              path: simple-support-test\n            path: shared/\n            field: KEY_1\n          file: false # new field\n    ```\n\n    or with the condensed format of `vault` configuration:\n\n    ```yaml\n    job:\n      secrets:\n        TEST_SECRET:\n           vault:  shared/KEY_1@simple-support-test\n           file: false # new field\n    ```    \n\n    As the chosen design is that every secret is turned into variable, the `file:` setting is added on the same level where `vault:` or any future secret type is defined. In other words - the `file: true/false` secret is a setting of the `TEST_SECRET` secret and not specific to the Vault type.\n\n    For backward compatibility the setting should not be required and either Runner or GitLab should default it to `true` in that case.\n\n1. Update the Runner API to contain the `file` entry in the job payload. As above, added as a boolean field `file` in the secret's hash, at the same level where current `vault` field exists.\n\n1. Update Runner to handle this new API field and create appropriate variable type.\n\n### Further details \n\nWe should be sure to keep these secrets as secret and maintain encryption at rest and in transit.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-17T15:51:01.848Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:07:05.495Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T11:59:28.016Z","closed_by":{"id":215818,"username":"tmaczukin","name":"Tomasz Maczukin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a9a99b9665ab7eda2cd7bffd54b1836?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmaczukin"},"labels":["Category:Secrets Management","GitLab Premium","Release::P2","Stretch","candidate::14.1","cicd::active","devops::configure","group::configure","release post item::in review","section::ops","security","type::maintenance","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":215818,"username":"tmaczukin","name":"Tomasz Maczukin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a9a99b9665ab7eda2cd7bffd54b1836?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmaczukin"}],"author":{"id":215818,"username":"tmaczukin","name":"Tomasz Maczukin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a9a99b9665ab7eda2cd7bffd54b1836?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmaczukin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":215818,"username":"tmaczukin","name":"Tomasz Maczukin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a9a99b9665ab7eda2cd7bffd54b1836?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmaczukin"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/250695","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/250695","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/250695/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/250695/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#250695","relative":"#250695","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#250695"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2875,"epic":{"id":30992,"iid":2875,"title":"Fetch \u0026 Configure Secrets","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2875","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71317405,"iid":250684,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow user to select all projects for group repository coverage report","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe GraphQL API to retrieve the group's projects only returns a max of 100 projects at a time.

I wrote about this in more detail in a [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/08/31/how-to-configure-dast-full-scans-for-complex-web-applications/).\n\nDAST provides the config option `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` that can be used to define which rules NOT to executed. While this gives some control over the executed rules, it has some shortcomings:\n1. New DAST releases might ship with new rules, which makes it necessary to manually add these rules to `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` before updating to the new release. Not doing so would break the DAST job. Updating `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` is tedious because there is no simple way to see which rules were added. In consequence, users might pin DAST to a specific version and rarely update.\n1. DAST configs that use `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` can get unwieldy, which leads to less readable and harder to maintain configs. This is in particular the case if DAST rules are split up across several jobs. In such a scenario, the problem is that the rules that should not be executed need to repeated in every job definition and it becomes unclear which rules a job acutally executes. See the example below:\n\n```yaml\n# We assume for the sake of brevity DAST has only 9 rules with ids 1 to 9. These rules are split up into 3 jobs. \n# In reality, DAST has many more rules and they might be split up in many more jobs (12 DAST jobs in our internal pipeline) \n# making real configs even more difficult to read and maintain.\n\njob1:\n- variables\n  - DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES: \"4,5,6,7,8,9\" # executes rule 1,2,3\n...\n\njob2:\n- variables\n  - DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES: \"1,2,3,6,7,8,9\"  # executes rule 4,5\n...\n\njob3:\n- variables\n  - DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES: \"1,2,3,4,5\" # executes 6,7,8,9\n...\n```\n\nOur internal pipeline configuration got very unreadable so that we had to implement a helper function that allowed us to express which rules we want to run in a job, as opposed to which rules not to run https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/dast.gitlab-ci.yml#L54. This greatly improved readability, but could not address 1).\n\nIt would be great if DAST provided an option to define which rules to execute, in addition to which rules NOT to execute.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe UX goal is twofold:\n- Make it easy for users to update to new DAST releases that require tight control over which rules are executed.\n- Increase the readability of DAST configs\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement an option (e.g. `DAST_ONLY_INCLUDE_RULES`) that allows specifying which rules to execute.\n\nIf both `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` and `DAST_ONLY_INCLUDE_RULES` are configured for the same scan and have the same rule added to both, the included rules should take precedence and the rule executed.\n\n#### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Reimplement `DAST_EXCLUDE_RULES` using `zapv2.ascan.disable_scanners` and `zapv2.pscan.disable_scanners`. Ensure that the rules are not executing. @avielle tested the functionality and it appears as if the rules are not executing, but ensure that this is the case. Go back to ~\"workflow::solution validation\" if the rules are still executing\n- [ ] Implement `DAST_ONLY_INCLUDE_RULES` using `zapv2.ascan.disable_all_scanners`, `zapv2.pscan.disable_all_scanners`, and the corresponding `enable_scanners` rules\n- [ ] Update the docs with instructions on using `DAST_ONLY_INCLUDE_RULES`.

Convert UI from HAML -\u003e Vue","description":"## What/Why\n\nMoving forward with the later iterations of the [Geo Search UX Refresh](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4084) we will be adding a [multitude of search filters and facets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241691).  \n\nWith the current Search Frontend Architecture we will be required to initiate a new page load for every filter.  This can result in a less than desirable user experience.  Especially when users are attempting to add many filters.\n\nThe page reload interaction can be seen already causing a bit of an odd affect with our most recent contribution of adding State Filters to the Issue/MR pages.\n\nWith the introduction of using a VueJS approach we can instead allow for asynchronous interactions with our server via API requests.  This will also allow us to introduce both a loading screen as well as the ability to allow users to continue to \"add\" filters as the requests are loading.  This will provide the user with a UI that is much more responsive to their interactions.  This will also speed up their ability to fine tune their searches.\n\n## Current and Proposed Architecture \n\n| | Current (HAML/Rails) | Proposed (Vue/HAML/Rails)\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Search Frontend Architecture | ![Search_Architecture__Current_](/uploads/5f46e47a086804abb86cee929bd5532e/Search_Architecture__Current_.png) | ![Search_Architecture__Proposed_](/uploads/32bff01f97b19fcc4894d87cf230d296/Search_Architecture__Proposed_.png) |\n\n## Is this a priority?\n\nAt first glance this might seem like it is a \"nice to have\" enhancement that we can put off until we get more of the redesign efforts done.  However, I would like to add some caution to this because there are some significant scalability concerns with the current code in Global Search.\n\nThe main concern here is that each \"scope\" in search is hardcoded into its own file.  Our current approach to the UX refresh is to focus **Issues** and **Merge Requests**.  With these scopes being in their own explicit files it is effectively causing **double** the work to enhance both of these views.  This is then stretched out even further when we begin to focus on the other scopes or add new scopes (like epics).  Also naturally as we focus on particular scope, the other scopes UI begins to look very dated in comparison.\n\nFurthermore, as we continue to refresh the designs, if we ever want to change a particular thing, this then will require us to go and update that said thing in **every** scope's particular file.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI would like to propose that we try and push to get the existing code moved into Vue sooner rather than later.  This will provide us with the functional requirements that we need for the proposed new architecture.  As well as it will allow us to introduce a more generalize solution that can handle the results view across all scopes in one generic collection of components rather than spread across many explicit files. \n\n## Discussion Update (September, 29th 2020)\n\nAfter talking with @mbergeron we have found a more iterative approach to working towards this eventual goal.  For context originally I had proposed we take on the Vue UI in a separate Feature Flag Block View (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42743).  This would allow us to fledge out the UI in Vue and then do a clean swap between the old and new.  However, after listening to Micael's concerns we recognized that this was actually a more risky approach as we need to support both UIs for a time as well as we do not get immediate feedback on any potential issues with the new UI this way.\n\n## The New Proposed Approach\n\nThe new approach will involve replacing small components with Vue counterparts individually.  These components will be injected into the existing HAML and will be able to work along with the current Rails approach.  This will allow for multiple contributors to focus individual components in the Search UI without overlap.\n\nBefore we start hammering out different components we will want to create a singular Vue instance at the top level of the Search UI.  Using this instance we will then bootstrap the different components we create to the single instance rather than managing individual Vue instances like we currently are in the [State Filter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41282) and [Confidentiality Filter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40793).\n\nThe biggest advantage of starting with a Singular Vue instance is we can also leverage a Mixin that populates the Vuex store and that store will be shared amongst the different components (since they are all tied to the same instance).  This is effectively the same way Vue _typically_ works in situations where we are just injecting a single entry point for a full Vue application (our end goal).\n\nAs we create the different components and inject them into the HAML we will then be able to see immediate feedback from users as well as solving for issues like: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247895#note_414393867\n\nWe also will be able to utilize Pajamas/GitLab UI to further speed up our development life cycle.\n\nFinally, when we are ready to switch to a AJAX/Async approach we simply will need to implement the API calls and re-organize the files and boom we will have a fully fledged out Vue UI :innocent:","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-15T18:43:35.944Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T17:19:11.775Z","closed_at":"2020-10-05T14:39:23.462Z","closed_by":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","advanced search","devops::data_stores","group::global search","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249709","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/249709","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/249709/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/249709/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#249709","relative":"#249709","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#249709"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":71213247,"iid":249662,"project_id":278964,"title":"Setup omnibus managed cronjob to trigger reindexing","description":"This issue tracks the effort to create a cronjob with omnibus to trigger database index rebuilds automatically.\n\nThis should trigger a rake task (`gitlab:db:reindex_auto` or similar) at a set schedule.
