This has the side-effect that the user always has to reenter the `api_key` when making changes.\n\n## Improvements\n\n\u003c!--\nExplain the benefits of refactoring this code.\nSee also https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\nAlign the ~backend code to also check for the field type, instead of hard-coding the field name.\n\nThis should be straightforward since we already have access to the current `@service` instance in the `service_params` method.\n\n## Involved components\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n- `app/controllers/concerns/service_params.rb`\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\nThis should fix the password-clearing behaviour in the Datadog integration.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-19T14:26:21.191Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:43:59.025Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T12:39:51.515Z","closed_by":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Stretch","backend","devops::manage","group::integrations","missed:14.2","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"}],"author":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328239","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328239","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328239/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328239/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328239","relative":"#328239","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328239"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85456488,"iid":328237,"project_id":278964,"title":"[SM User Cap BE]: Ask admins to confirm auto approval of pending users only when pending users risk being approved","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\nAt the moment, modifying admin settings that run the risk of auto-approving pending users will warn the admin on saving.

~GraphQL keyset pagination.\n\nThe following discussion from !58657 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @10io started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58657#note_552292628):  (+7 comments)\n\n    \u003e So here is the summary of our small investigation with @nmezzopera :\n    \u003e \n    \u003e * Keyset pagination is used\n    \u003e * Keyset pagination uses a [`OrderInfo`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9fcdc3068074b415c7f9207e803da047ad90cf0e/lib/gitlab/graphql/pagination/keyset/order_info.rb) to analyze the current query, extract the order Arel node and build the proper conditions for the given page accessed.\n    \u003e * The problem is that this `OrderInfo` only [supports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9fcdc3068074b415c7f9207e803da047ad90cf0e/lib/gitlab/graphql/pagination/keyset/order_info.rb#L60-67) very specific arel nodes.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Here are the cases supported:\n    \u003e * If the query order is a \"full\" arel node. Example:\n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e Packages::Package.order(created_at: :asc).order_values\n    \u003e =\u003e [#\u003cArel::Nodes::Ascending:0x00007fbf46094018\n    \u003e   @expr=\n    \u003e    #\u003cstruct Arel::Attributes::Attribute\n    \u003e     relation=\n    \u003e      #\u003cArel::Table:0x00007fbf7177afc8\n    \u003e       @name=\"packages_packages\",\n    \u003e       @table_alias=nil,\n    \u003e       @type_caster=#\u003cActiveRecord::TypeCaster::Map:0x00007fbf7177b040 @types=Packages::Package(id: integer, project_id: integer, created_at: datetime_with_timezone, updated_at: datetime_with_timezone, name: string, version: string, package_type: integer, creator_id: integer, status: integer)\u003e\u003e,\n    \u003e     name=\"created_at\"\u003e\u003e]\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Here are the cases not supported:\n    \u003e 1. If the query order is built with `.order('X ASC')`\n    \u003e    * The arel node for the order is simply a string:\n    \u003e       ```ruby\n    \u003e       Packages::Package.order('created_at ASC').order_values\n    \u003e       =\u003e [\"created_at ASC\"]\n    \u003e       ```\n    \u003e 1. If the query order is built with a joined table `joins(T).order('Ts.X ASC')`\n    \u003e    * Same thing as 1.\n    \u003e        ```ruby\n    \u003e        Packages::Package.joins(:project).order('projects.created_at ASC').order_values\n    \u003e        =\u003e [\"projects.created_at ASC\"]\n    \u003e        ```\n    \u003e 1. If the query order is built with a joined table `joins(T).order('Ts.X' =\u003e :asc)`\n    \u003e    * The arel node for the order doesn't have an `expr` object but a string:\n    \u003e        ```ruby\n    \u003e        Packages::Package.joins(:project).order('projects.created_at' =\u003e :asc).order_values\n    \u003e        =\u003e [#\u003cArel::Nodes::Ascending:0x00007fbf366cdbb0 @expr=\"\\\"projects\\\".\\\"created_at\\\"\"\u003e]\n    \u003e        ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e In this MR, we are on cases (1.) and (2.), see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5e1e833f2574206dac810359539b24dd959beadc/app/models/packages/package.rb#L124-136.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e In my opinion, there are two things here:\n    \u003e 1. This seems to be a ~bug in the keyset paginator. We have models that have the same order statements (joined in with a `T` table) and currently doesn't work. Those sort functions are exposed on ~GraphQL and currently not working.\n    \u003e    * Example:\n    \u003e        ```graphql\n    \u003e        {\n    \u003e          projects(sort: \"storage_size_desc\") {\n    \u003e            nodes {\n    \u003e              name\n    \u003e            },\n    \u003e            pageInfo {\n    \u003e              endCursor,\n    \u003e              startCursor\n    \u003e            }\n    \u003e          }\n    \u003e        }\n    \u003e        ```\n    \u003e     * This uses this [sort](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/248070c87ddf5824199cd8c8db2f087e7aeadd7e/app/models/project.rb#L742) and this will make the ~GraphQL query fail. See this [sentry error](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/2577115/).\n    \u003e 1. For this MR, the keyset paginator will not be possible to use with the current sorting we have on `Packages::Package`.

Coverage Fuzzing artifact download to use GraphQL endpoint instead of legacy API for Pipelines Page Part 1","description":"## Order Of Issues\n\nFirst two issues can be done in parallel.\n\n| Order | Issue | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| 1 | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328194 | Adds support to generic download component to take a pipeline id\n| 1 | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328482 | Backend issue to implement support for query\n| 2 | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328481 | Use component from Part 1. We can stage this in parallel but need to land after ~backend is complete.\n\nThis is related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/289952\n\nIn the pipelines show page for a single pipeline we show the fuzing artifact download. Using a flakey REST endpoint.\n\nNow that \\#251015 is complete, we can do this refactor.\n\n## Benefits of this refactor\n\nIf a user overrides the `stage` param defined in the `.base_fuzz` template, by defining a `stage` variable, it will no longer break artifact downloads.\n\n## Original implementation issues for Coverage Fuzzing artifact download buttons:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217151\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210343\n\nWe relied on a fragile assumption that the `.fuzz_base` CI template would not have a particular parameter over-riden by the user. If they replaced the variable, it would cause the artifact download buttons to not show.\n\nA graphQL endpoint was added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251015 to allow us to show artifacts of a particular report type in any given pipeline.\n\nProblem we still need to solve - The artifact download component and graphql endpoint expect a merge request ID and a project full path. The pipelines controller doesn't have a merge request ID scope for the pipeline. So we need to figure out a way to expose the merge request ID for a given pipeline. Which I'm not sure if that relation exists.\n\nAnother solution is to update the graphQL endpoint created in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251015 to accept a pipeline ID.\n\nLooking at the comment in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251015#note_445123082 it seems like ~backend **might** work with just a pipeline ID. @avielle not sure if you can confirm.\n\n\n            \u003cartifact-download\n              v-if=\"shouldShowDownloadGuidance\"\n              :report-types=\"[$options.reportTypes.COVERAGE_FUZZING]\"\n              :target-project-full-path=\"targetProjectFullPath\"\n              :mr-iid=\"mrIid\"\n            /\u003e\n\n## New Implementation Plan\nNew component should look something like. I opted to not use the scoped slot because right now we only ever render `\u003csecurity-report-download-dropdown /\u003e` in the template. Adding a scoped slot would be optimizing prematurely since we don't have any other component that would go into the slot.\n\n```\n\u003cpipeline-artifact-download\n   v-if=\"shouldShowDownloadGuidance\"\n   :target-project-full-path=\"targetProjectFullPath\"\n   :mr-iid=\"mrIid\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\n## Old Frontend Implementation Plan\n1. Create a parent renderless component to house the apollo query specific to pipeline page, and any other associated logic. This includes the report-type prop.\n1. Add default slot\n1.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-16T18:00:50.423Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T13:29:06.961Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T19:37:56.462Z","closed_by":{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Deliverable","GitLab Core","backend","devops::secure","direction","documentation","group::static analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"}],"author":{"id":3652047,"username":"twoodham","name":"Thomas Woodham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3652047/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/twoodham"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328070","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 8 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328070","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328070/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328070/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328070","relative":"#328070","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328070"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5797,"epic":{"id":252445,"iid":5797,"title":"Promote semgrep to general availability","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5797","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85331522,"iid":328069,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document how Semgrep can be run in an offline environment","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

We will need Semgrep to be available through the Config UI for it to become GA.\n\nFurther, we are currently limited in versions that an analyzer can be. Until we remove `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG` as a setting, Semgrep's version will also have to be brought up be major version `2`.\n\n### Proposal \n\n- [ ] Add semgrep to all places it's missing in the Config UI\n- [ ] Update semgrep to version `2` while we're waiting for `SAST_ANALZER_IMAGE_TAG` to be removed\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

The current approach leads us to [prefer specific analyzers over others](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/875085991233de8f67994973bd6e3676057cc264/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/security/scanner.rb#L9-15). We made a conscious decision to prefer other analyzer over semgrep while that analyzer was being developed. However, we're now moving to standardize upon semgrep after it becomes generally available. We need to flip this relationship so the semgrep is preferred over other ~\"Category:SAST\" analyzers.\n\n### Proposal \n\n#### Allow secondary identifier match if there is no primary identifier (or uuid) match\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331626\n\n##### 4. Implementation\n\n(See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353271#note_859225232)\n\n1. When processing a `security_finding`, we attempt to find `vulnerability_finding` by UUID.\n    1. If UUID match, update `vulnerability_finding`\n    1. If No UUID match, calculate UUIDs for secondary identifiers (non-generic) attempt `vulnerability_finding` lookup by UUIDs\n    1. If No UUIDs match, insert new `vulnerability_finding`.\n\nNote: While implementing this, it was discovered there is no need to change `ANALYZER_ORDER` for existing analyzers. For existing deduplication scenarios (ex: bandit+semgrep, or gosec+semgrep, etc.) we want it to continue to work as it did before so that we don't make extra work for customers. While we still host analyzer images for analyzers that are being replaced, we need to support deduplication. As we add semgrep support for more languages, we will want to follow the pattern for bandit and spotbugs. \n \n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-16T15:40:01.998Z","updated_at":"2022-12-20T23:01:39.974Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T17:06:31.144Z","closed_by":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"labels":["Category:SAST","GitLab Core","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","direction","documentation","group::static analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:13.12","missed:15.1","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"}],"author":{"id":3652047,"username":"twoodham","name":"Thomas Woodham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3652047/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/twoodham"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328062","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328062","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328062/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328062/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328062","relative":"#328062","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328062"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6440,"epic":{"id":314498,"iid":6440,"title":"Enable new analyzers to take over reporting for existing vulnerabilities","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6440","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85306125,"iid":328048,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group hook push event branch filter does not apply","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nI have a group webhook at https://gitlab.com/groups/whisperfish/-/hooks, with \"push event\" enabled.

The docs you linked are most relevant for self-managed. We don't mention username or nickname on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/\n\nThe reason it works for self-managed, is due to attribute_statements configuration documented at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/saml.html#attribute_statements. If the admin configures the nickname or username statement, and it's present in the response, it works\n\nYes, we should create a feature proposal. It wouldn't be too much work to either look up the username/nickname differently or specify a default attribute statement for GitLab.com\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.\nUse the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n-

pipeline","description":"release bug note https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/85857\n\n### Summary\n\nRecently we changed behaviour of `dependency_scanning` analyzer so it generates multiple test jobs. Due to how we fetch pipeline to get results for Dependency List and License List pages [pipeline query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b270cb6a0162be20e29eb9a0ae3352de02602cc7/ee/app/models/ee/project.rb#L314) and [service used in endpoints](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/998fe1103b67075ec00c42150287513c1563785e/ee/app/services/security/report_fetch_service.rb#L14) we might end in a situation when one of `dependency_scanning` jobs is finished even if the pipeline is still running, we can get wrong results in Dependency List page as only part of dependencies will be displayed. \n\nAdditional drawback of the current solution is the fact that for large pipelines we won't get vulnerabilities in the Dependency List until the pipeline is finished (as we get vulnerabilities from the same pipeline as dependencies information (`dependency_files` section of the report). \n\n**Note:** Related [API endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dependencies.html) is also affected, as it also uses `ReportFetchService` to get a pipeline. \n\n**Note:** Licence list page isn't affected because `license_scanning` is running as one job.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe easiest way to reproduce it is to go to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/dependencies and wait until the next pipeline on `master` starts. And then wait until one of the `dependency_scanning` jobs finished, and observe the page.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/dependencies\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\ndependencies displayed partially only for the finished job.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe need to use the different pipeline to fetch dependencies: only one that has passed and contains the right job artifacts.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nGitLab 13.11 - latest version\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nUpdate https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/998fe1103b67075ec00c42150287513c1563785e/ee/app/services/security/report_fetch_service.rb#L14 but we need to take into account the fact that some projects (as GitLab itself) can have multiple pipeline configuration. We need to get a finished pipeline with existing dependency scanning artifacts\n\n1. add tests to reproduce this bug\n1. update https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75173a799bd350f52dcd3c0b646243ed3d793b4c/ee/app/models/ee/project.rb#L316 to include `success` scope:\n`all_pipelines.success.newest_first(ref: project.default_branch).with_reports`","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-15T17:45:45.387Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T07:09:20.532Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T04:56:37.165Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","approaching-SLO","backend","dependency list","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","missed-SLO","priority::2","release post item","section::sec","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327955","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327955","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327955/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327955/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#327955","relative":"#327955","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#327955"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":85264980,"iid":327944,"project_id":278964,"title":"Technical Investigation: Merge request approval rule for code coverage","description":"### Summary\n\nTo resolve https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15765 we have decided to implement a new merge request approvals rule similar to License and Vulnerability checking.\n\nWe need to research how to implement the ~frontend and ~backend for this feature.\n\n### Questions to answer \n\n~frontend \n- How do multiple approval rules stack?\n- How do we create the project setting?\n- How do we determine the state of the merge request `merge` component?\n- Is there anywhere else we need to change in order to create a merge request approval?\n\n~backend \n- How will we determine when the coverage has increased/decreased against the target branch?\n- How do we create the merge request approval rule?\n- Is there anything else we need to do in order to hook up the coverage rule to the merge request page?\n- What do we do if coverage is unavailable on the source branch?

Now that https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60894 is merged, do not implement new override EE methods just to call `LoadBalancing`. Simply call it from the core code.\n1.

roll-out `:new_route_storage_purchase` | 👈 you are here |\n| release the feature and remove `:new_route_storage_purchase` |gitlab-org/gitlab#337720 |\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to roll out [the feature](ISSUE LINK) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `\u003cnew_route_storage_purchase\u003e` feature flag.\n\nThe feature is updating the Storage purchase from an external one (on Customers Portal) to the one embedded in GitLab. More details in the [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5789).\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::purchase\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_purchase`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @dzubova \n- PM: @tgolubeva \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- [ ] Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with testing groups\n- [ ] Rollout on GitLab.com for a certain period (2 milestones)\n- [ ] Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com\n- [ ] Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can also be useful to review --\u003e\n\n## Testing Groups/Projects/Users\n\n\u003c!-- If applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example. --\u003e\n\n* `gitlab-org`/`tatyanas-test-gitlab-group` group (`@tgolubeva`)\n* `gitlab-org`/`test-group-894` group (`@esybrant`)\n* `gitlab-org`/`atlas-italia` group (`@agulina`)\n* `gitlab-org`/`brave-flamingo` group (`@dzubova`)\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen a group is eligible for purchasing additional Storage, the button on the Usage Quotas -\u003e Storage leads to the GitLab-embedded purchase flow.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf something goes wrong, the customers won't be able to purchase additional Storage. Disabling the FF will be sufficient to solve any incident.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n* https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/\n* https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-purchase/stage-groups-group-dashboard-fulfillment-purchase?orgId=1\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set new_route_storage_purchase true --dev` **NOT RELEVANT**\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Crosslink the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the on-call SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary for the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [x] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e new_route_ci_minutes_purchase true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set new_route_storage_purchase \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout). **NOT RELEVANT**\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set new_route_storage_purchase \u003crollout-percentage\u003e` **NOT RELEVANT**\n  - Enable the feature globally in the production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set new_route_storage_purchase true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5789) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nThe release of the feature will be handled in gitlab-org/gitlab#337720\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set new_route_storage_purchase false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-15T13:25:15.709Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T07:03:05.677Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T08:45:49.296Z","closed_by":{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana

Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Adjust your browser window height to be lower than `780px`\n1. See the button is hidden behind the review bar\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe review bar overlays the button\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe issuable sidebar (container for the buttons on the right hand side) should shrink in size not to overlap with the review bar.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![copy-branch-name-hidden](/uploads/4fc5133aa052e12bf80badab71066036/copy-branch-name-hidden.mp4)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWe've implemented fix for the exact same issue for the file tree on the left https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59150 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288343\n\n@iamphill [recommends](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59150#note_551559461) reducing duplication by adding watcher to the [`review_bar.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f14ca132037e36fcb3f788e5ddcac736c2d4be21/app/assets/javascripts/batch_comments/components/review_bar.vue), which would set a class on body that indicates that the MR review bar is visible. This would allow us to remove most of the new code introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59150 except for the styling.\n\nWe should also change the styling of the issuable sidebar to use CSS `calc()` and custom properties (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327867).\n\n/cc

approaches: Shard GitLab database using Application Sharding","description":"## Executive Summary\n\nThis issue is to use application-level sharding to shard GitLab database.\nThis is meant to define a holistic approach that allows us to shard all current database\nand all added data in the future in a well-defined approach.\n\nThis can imply evaluating:\n\n* extending GitLab Rails application with support for many databases\n* introduce a middleware for database access layer to inteligently access additional database\n* define a boundaries around data access and data affinity\n\n## Design validation goals\n\n* Use separate databases with a single application that are not part of the same cluster\n* Define responsibilities of databases and their expected SLAs and impact on a system availability\n* Each physical database is treated as a complete self-sufficient instance with patroni, many primaries and replicas\n* Each physical database will be sharded by default by using many logical databases\n* If logical shards do grow we move logical databases to a separate physical databases to spread the load\n* The logical shards are used as this simplifies management as the whole physical database (containing many shards) can be replicated and automated with backup functions\n* The logical shards are also desired to reduce amount of needed open database connections, as a single physical connection can be used to access many logical shards\n* Evaluate a way to ensure that a cross-shard data access is forbidden\n* Evaluate a way to use [Rails 6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296870) for supporting many databases to avoid a custom made solution\n* The smallest shardable entity is **Project**. However, for the focus on a first implementation we allow to **define** a much broader sharding critiera: top-level group or group\n* Evaluate a way to migrate offline/online data within a sharding criteria between shards\n* Evaluate a way to iteratively use new application shards for validating application performance and being bug-free when supporting many databases\n* Evaluate after defining sharding criteria impact on a different functions of GitLab and a way to efficiently aggregate the data:\n  * ex.: if we shard by project, it means that for a single group project can be on many shards: how we would aggregate group level features?\n  * ex2.: if we shard by top-level group, likely only some functions would be broken, like: user groups, all user issues and all user merge requests, the explore function: how we would aggregate instance-wide level features?\n* Evaluate how the code would be implemented in a FOSS, vs EE to reduce the sharding abstraction layer, as it is assumed that EE will only receive this feature\n* Evaluate how the shard-application-by-default approach can be implemented for on-premise installations: ex.: can we use many logical databases for application sharding in a same way how we run GitLab.com?\n\n## Demo Goals\n\n* Implement application-level sharding\n* Implement middleware on database access layer to intelligently choose application shards based on accessed data\n* Define a main database, and many logical shards that will contain a hierarchy of `top-level group \u003e group \u003e project`\n* Define a sharding critiera and sharding affinity (what type of data, and up-to what level) is accessible within a single application shard\n* Evaluate a ways to discover a cross-shards joins where some queries might try to access sibling projects or groups which are impossible to be accessed\n* Evaluate an impact on the foreign keys or what foreign keys would have to be removed\n* Evaluate a way to have a consistent and unique IDs across all shards\n* Evaluate a way to copy data over in a manual/offline way","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-15T13:03:47.806Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:23:37.010Z","closed_at":"2021-04-21T09:44:53.964Z","closed_by":{"id":3944199,"username":"fzimmer","name":"Fabian Zimmer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3944199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fzimmer"},"labels":["auto updated","devops::data_stores","group::pods","wg_database-scalability"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327881","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327881","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327881/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327881/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#327881","relative":"#327881","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#327881"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6131,"epic":{"id":285012,"iid":6131,"title":"Proof Of Concepts","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6131","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85250050,"iid":327880,"project_id":278964,"title":"Evaluation: Holistic approaches: Shard GitLab database using database partitioning","description":"## Executive Summary\n\nThis issue is to use database partitioning to shard GitLab database.

Summarize in one place and clearly document high peak events and other issues during the past year\n1. Gather in one document the predictions on the runway we have for our current architecture\n1.

Dramatic usage ping speed improvement","description":"***\n\n## Summary\n\nWeekly usage ping generation for gitlab.com was taking over around 40hours, until 2021 Feb 5th. On that day it started to take ~10 hours, and since February 5th it takes between 8 hours to 10hours only. There's a 5x speed boost,  but we don't know the root cause.\n\nService(s) affected : Background job usage ping generation\nTeam attribution : database \u0026 product intelligence \u0026 infra\nMinutes downtime or degradation : There's an improvement of 5x in usage ping speed.\n\n\nUsage ping executes over 500 SQL queries in batches in the primary database.\n\nCurrently ~\"product intelligence\" team members generate the usage ping on production rails console. See the steps https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325248#how-to-generate-usage-ping-for-gtilabcom\n\n```\nbin/rake gitlab:usage_data:dump_sql_in_yaml\n```\n\n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n| Question | Answer |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| What was the impact | We had a 5x boost in speed of usage ping generation |\n| Who was impacted | Gitlab.com primary |\n| How did this impact customers | Positively as less load on their servers too |\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n| Question | Answer |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| When was the incident detected? | 2021-02-05 first ever |\n| How was the incident detected? | In usage ping monitoring issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/298366#note_502413019 |\n| Did alarming work as expected? | Monitoring worked |\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n\n- Till 2021-02-05 - Usage ping background work took ~40hours, getting slower and slower.\n- Till 2021-02-05 - It took 10 hours\n- Afterwards it takes 8 to 10 hours\n\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n\nSome possible explanations\n\n1. Some challenging  queries might time out, which will reduce the total duration, at the expense of failing queries. See \"monitor usage ping\" issues, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/298366 and we don't have dramatic change in failed metrics\n\n2. Some infrastructure/database optimization\n\n3. Instead of direct rails console access - `ssh aakgun-rails@console-01-sv-gprd.` we go through `ssh -A lb-bastion.gprd.gitlab.com`, with `screen -x` But could that change anything?\n\n\n### Example of the usage of \"5 whys\"\n\nUsage ping generation took a long time.\n\n1. Why? - The battery is dead.\n2. Why? - The alternator is not functioning.\n3. Why? - The alternator belt has broken.\n4. Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced.\n5. Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)\n\n## What went well\n\n\n## What can be improved\n\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- [5

To give users a similar experience, move to a new system.\n\n### Proposal\n\nVersions will be \"MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\"\n\n- MAJOR: Incremented when changes are not backwards compatible. Whenever possible, avoid having to increment this number.\n- MINOR: Feature changes. Increments for each published container image. Should include a changelog.\n- PATCH: Patch for an existing MAJOR.MINOR release. (Perhaps this should stay build?)\n\nThis change will require re-thinking how we produce builds and include version numbers in components.\n\n#### Option 1: Increment minor after a pub release\n\nExisting build process intact, but change our version calculations so minor is incremented after each production release. For this to work we would make PATCH be BUILD #. So releases would never be `MAJOR.MINOR.0`, they would be more like:\n\n1. `1.1.10`\n1. `1.2.5`\n1. `1.3.25`\n\nIn this example, each public release causing the minor version to increment. The final octet becomes the build number of the minor version.\n\n#### Option 2: Increment minor when ready to publish\n\nFor this option we would need to re-think how we embed version numbers into releases. The current process embeds version numbers during the build process. Since we will not know the version number up front, another method is needed.\n\n#### Changelogs\n\nEach public release should include a changelog.\n\n1. GitLab's changelog functionality. Investigate to see if this would be useful. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repositories.html#add-changelog-data-to-a-changelog-file\n\n#### Publishing\n\nWhen publishing a new container, a new \"release\" should be created with the changelog.

With our current implementation, we don't know **which lines introduced new degradation** as we don't have a base report to compare with.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe team has spoken and we will implement **option 2**.\n\n#### ~~1. Generate report when creating diff to MR widget~~\n\nLet's revisit our current approach by persisting our `PipelineArtifact` once we generate our comparison report at the merge request level which is used for our MR widget.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR;\n  GenerateCodequalityReportComparison--\u003eFetchNewDegradationIntroduced\n  FetchNewDegradationIntroduced--\u003ePersistThemAsPipelineArtifact\n  PersistThemAsPipelineArtifact--\u003eDataIntegrityFixed\n```\n\nHere an example solution of how it could look like in ruby 👉 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59421\n\n\n#### 2. Building diff after pipeline completion\n\nThe other option we have would be to generate our diff report on pipeline completion, keep it as it is today.\n\nWe could modify our [existing service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/ci/pipeline_artifacts/create_code_quality_mr_diff_report_service.rb) and build our report within it. This allows us to keep our existing architecture and only refactor the way we [build our diff report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/codequality_mr_diff.rb).\n\n```diff\n module Ci\n   module PipelineArtifacts\n     class

The widget should instead use the \"Failed to load code quality report\" status/message in this case.~~ \n\n(on further investigation, `failed` refers to the status of the scan and not to the status of the report comparison, so we don't need to change the behavior in this case)\n\n:two: The code quality MR widget correctly reports \"Base pipeline code quality artifact not found\" when that is the case, but it is determined from the data source that we used before moving the comparison to the backend. We should instead show this message when the `status` is `not_found` so that we can remove the redundant code from the frontend. This could be combined with [moving the message into the body of the widget to make it more discoverable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293716)\n\n![image](/uploads/ab7819ccc9507c18c02ff5dec38d06e5/image.png)\n\n:three: The code quality MR widget incorrectly reports \"No changes to code quality\" when the backend is still parsing and comparing the base and head reports (indicated by the HTTP status `204 No Content`). In this case we should display a loading icon and continue to poll until we get a response with a different HTTP status so we can display the results in the widget once they have been generated.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFor :one:\n1. Run code quality on the base commit of an MR\n1. Somehow cause an error when running code quality on the head commit of the MR\n1. The JSON response should show a status of `failed` but the widget will say \"No changes to code quality\"\n\nFor :two: \n1. Run code quality on the head commit of an MR, but not the base commit\n1. The JSON response should show a status of `not_found` and the widget will say \"Failed to load codeclimate report\"\n1. The widget should have a question mark icon with a popover that says \"Base pipeline code quality artifact not found\" and links to the docs\n\nFor :three: \n1. Run code quality on the base commit and head commit of an MR with code quality changes\n1. Once the job is done for the head commit, refresh the MR page until you can see the code quality widget\n1. On the first load that you can see the widget, it should display \"No changes to code quality\" even though there are changes, and the network panel in your browser's dev tools should show a request for `codequality_reports.json` with a `204 No Content` response\n1. Refresh the page again until the widget displays the real result\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe code quality MR widget reports \"No changes to code quality\" when the report comparison has failed/errored\n\nThe code quality MR widget reports \"No changes to code quality\" when the reports are still being parsed/compared\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe code quality MR widget should show \"Failed to load code quality\" (or some other more specific/helpful error message) when the report comparison has failed/errored\n\nThe code quality MR widget should show a loading indicator while the reports are being parsed/compared, continue to poll for results until the endpoint returns a different result, then display the corresponding message for that result.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs -

For example:\n\n```\n./app/assets/javascripts/static_site_editor/constants.js:export const DEFAULT_TARGET_BRANCH = 'master';\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe word `master` is present in many places in the codebase. For 14.0 we are most interested in changing `master` to `main` only when it will break the application if `master` is returned, eg: `@project.default_branch || 'master'`.\n\nThe full objective of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3600 is to completely remove the word `master` from the codebase including method names, constants and in test data. \n\nWork on this issue should produce:\n\n- MRs to remove `master` where it will break the application when there is no longer a `master` branch\n- a follow-up issue to remove all of the other references, which will be scheduled at some point after %\"14.0\" \n\nIf it is just as easy to change the references as part of this issue, then go for it! :rocket: \n\n## Initial scans \n\n#### ./spec files\n\n```\ngrep -r

Iterate on Active trial status - Promote high interest features during trial.","description":"## Problem\n\nWe are currently sending weekly emails to advertise some features and having our sales team reaching out to users during the trial period. But so far nothing in app connects the user with the value they just unlocked. We may be able to do a more effective job at following up on trials and attempting to drive these trial users to convert promoting high interest features.\n\n#### What we know\n\nIn an organization, the people signing up and starting the trial process are not always the ones involved in trying out GitLab and its various features. (Buyers personas v.s User personas). The internal users that could advocate for the product are not fully exposed to its value.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nIn-app trial follow-ups are more likely to increase trial to paid conversion:\n\n* Actual users of the product would be the best advocate for its adoption.\n* In context feature discovery is more likely to prove product value and lead to an \"a-ha\" moment (v.s emails).\n\nTo verify this we will display feature promotion in the trial status widget and measure the impact on trial to paid conversion.\n\n## Input data\n* Trial to paid [baseline conversion rate](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/761347/Group-Namespace-Conversion-Metrics?widget=10130784\u0026udv=0).\n* Baseline Initial experiment results for trial widget(TBD).\n* Top 3 features company upgrade for Bronze (before EOA): \n   * Merge approvals\n   * Multiple approvers in code review\n   * Code Review Analytics\n* Top 3 features company upgrade for Silver\n   * Merge request reviews\n   * Approval rules for code review\n   * CI/CD Pipelines Dashboard\n* [Top 10 features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1012#note_550356621) that are of high interest for users.\n\n## Potential solution\nUpdate the trial widget content to promote Dependency scanning in the first 7 days of the trial. We are not picking any features mentioned above as we would not be able to reach significance running an experiment (see [design thread for more](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327682/designs/MR-approval-rule-prompt.png)).\n\n### Design\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/a223281e1cc999a44644e334778d6640/image.png\" alt=\"promo\" width=\"350px\"\u003e\n\n#### Flow\n![feature-trial-status](/uploads/d229dc715831cd80991ab8879c7bb305/feature-trial-status.gif)\n\n#### [📐 Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/AGzUBIW7SwnYY5QGyNoRiU/Experiment-Add-active-trial-status?node-id=777%3A3648)\n\n\n\n### Things to consider\n* Can we accurately measure the following: User exposed to the test adopted the promoted feature \u003e Had a sustained usage of it \u003e Upgraded to plan X.\n* If the Learn GitLab tab is rolled-out, there is a potential overlap. Is there a way we could combine both?

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nUsers navigating to the project level deployment frequency charts see the following text `  \"The environment must be named production for its data to appear in these charts.\"`\n\n![image](/uploads/df7f32306b24f9d4bf34c685d58c7f9b/image.png)\n\nThis is no longer accurate since we shipped https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300741\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nThe text should be changed to:\n\n\u003e The chart displays information from production environment(s) based on the `deployment_tier` value. [Learn More.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/index.html#deployment-tier-of-environments)\n\nThis should be added to the following graphs:\n\n* Deployment Frequency\n* Lead time for changes\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.
