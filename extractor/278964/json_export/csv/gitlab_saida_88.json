Templates are hard to understand - it's practically impossible to know what each template is doing\n1. Unable to know when a new template is available\n1. Selecting the templates overrides your existing pipeline configuration\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What we learned?\n\nWe learned that most users would like to look at several templates and copy paste sections of them to their exiting pipeline configuration, so the current experience contradicts with the experience most users wants\n\n### What we can do?\n\n* Instead of going with the boring (and temporary) solution of adding a dropdown to the editor, (similar to the way it works today in the web-ide/single file editor), we can add a button that links to the template library, so users could view/browse and copy-paste section of the pipeline\n\n## Design\n\nSee the latest design attached below.

This could effectively wipe out important platforms.\n\nThis cleanup automation should only work for [dynamic environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#create-a-dynamic-environment).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Configure ci:\n```yml\ndeploy:\n  image: ...\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - on_deploy deploy --target $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH --platform\n  only:\n    - /development/\n  environment:\n    name: dev-infra/development\n    on_stop: destroy\n    kubernetes:\n      namespace: default\n\ndestroy:\n  image: ...\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - on_deploy destroy --target $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH --platform\n  when: manual\n  only:\n  - /development/\n  environment:\n    name: dev-infra/development\n    action: stop\n    kubernetes:\n      namespace: default\n```\n\n2. Open a MR against `development` branch\n3. Close MR\n4. The destroy job is triggered\n\n### Example Project\n\nNone\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWe have jobs that destroy our deployments when we stop our environments via the `environment.on_stop` keyword. The reference job itself is configured with `when:manual`.\n\nYesterday, we had a major incident because when closing a MR, somehow the destroy job was triggered thus deleting parts of our infra.\n\nThere is no link to the job within the MR which looks to us more like a bug. Plus it is not the intended behavior that closing a MR is the equivalent of stopping an environment.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe expect that closing a MR does not trigger stop jobs.\nAnd if it does, then it should be visible within the MR like other Mr triggered jobs and it should be specified in the docs.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n_Closing the MR_\n![Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.19.08](/uploads/f0aebb8658e9ae811066a962a8755c7b/Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.19.08.png)\n\n_Instantely triggered the destroy job_\n\n![Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.18.45](/uploads/b7f55de7f5ebb3d60660fb127fe65add/Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.18.45.png)\n\n_And the triggered pipeline is not part of the MR's pipelines_\n![Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.19.20](/uploads/43b372b0e26e99088fb08a34a32c4416/Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.19.20.png)\n\n![Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.23.33](/uploads/5cd713ced3870b4a29e9cc7c03599c3c/Schermafbeelding_2021-01-21_om_10.23.33.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92086#note_1021046886 from @ali-gitlab \n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n**thought (non-blocking):** The auto-stop behaviour applies regardless of whether an environment is dynamic or static.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThe fourth DORA4 metric is Change Failure rate which is the percentage of changes introduced to a production environment that cause a failure scenario. These metrics enable executives who are investing in DevOps transformation to understand ROI on processes they are implementing and tools they have purchased. Changes in these metrics easily become KPIs for those teams.\n\n* As an executive investing in DevOps, I want to see my ROI. I want to see an improvement in the Change Failure Rate of my dev team. This will most likely drive the KPIs of my team.\n* As a developer leader, I want to see that the team is improving by measuring the change failure rates and comparing it over time (over sprints).\n* As an analyst, I want to import the data from GitLab into an external monitoring tool, so I need API support to poll the data.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

In the true sense of DORA 4 - this is only meant for production, but there may be more than one prod environment and/or users may interested in non-prod environments.\n* Measuring how many rollbacks occurred (redeploy of an older pipeline than the one in production)\n* Measuring the [degradations reported](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/testing_and_reports_in_merge_requests.html) in an MR deployed to production.

([Watch video demo](https://www.loom.com/share/da48d8cc67674d5ca5598e766272bd7c).)\n\n### Problems to solve\n\nThe project-level input seems to have 2 problems:\n\n1. The label says the opposite of what it should say.  The label should say \"Prevent\" like at the instance level, not \"Allow\" (per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263275#note_489093878).\n1. The checkbox is disabled but NOT checked when the instance-level box is checked, so it is not clear if the instance-level setting is being enforced.  If the instance-level box is checked, the project-level box should be disabled and _checked_.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [ ] Change the project-level setting label to \"Prevent user from modifying MR Approval rules\" (per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263275#note_489093878).\n- [ ] Change the project-level behavior so the box is *checked and disabled* (not just disabled) when the instance-level box is checked.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T16:11:11.577Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T13:29:32.085Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T13:29:32.017Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["devops::manage","frontend","group::compliance","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299335","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299335","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299335/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299335/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299335","relative":"#299335","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299335"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77555463,"iid":299331,"project_id":278964,"title":"Extend dangerbot to automatically detect changes to underlaying Service Ping metrics queries","description":"## Background\n\nMany metrics collected in Usage Ping are sourced via SQL queries, that are build with usage of `ActiveRecord` [scopes](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes) that are also used for other purposes. When scope that is used in Usage Ping metric definition it cause underlying metric SQL query to change and that goes against\n[guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/51963) about metrics life cycle that discourages changes to metric SQL query. \n\n## Goal\n\nExtend dangerbot CI job to be able to compare Usage Ping SQL queries and detect any changes, to prevent unintended braking of Usage Ping data integrity\n\n## Example\nLts consider metric https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage/metrics/instrumentations/gitlab_for_jira_app_proxy_installations_count_metric.rb it relays on scope `JiraConnectInstallation#proxy_installations` which is implemented as\n\n```ruby\n  scope :proxy_installations, -\u003e { where.not(instance_url: nil) }\n```\n\nRight now following scenario is possible. ~\"group::integrations\" iterates over a jira integration feature, and redefine `proxy_installations` to have very specific `instace_url` lets say `instance_url: proxy.jira.gitlab.com`, some developer apply changes to the scope to make it look like\n\n```ruby\n  scope :proxy_installations, -\u003e { where(instance_url: 'proxy.jira.gitlab.com') }\n```\n\nbut they forgot that https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage/metrics/instrumentations/gitlab_for_jira_app_proxy_installations_count_metric.rb metric exists and it still uses the scope as it was\n\n```ruby\n  relation { JiraConnectInstallation.proxy_installations }\n```\n\nIn this case what is happening, yet goes unnoticed is that `counts.gitlab_for_jira_app_proxy_installations` Service Ping metric got changed, and no team was notified, and data might be skewed as a result.\n\nThe goal of this issue is to create tooling that would compare Service Ping queries for feature branch and main repository branch and detect changes to flag them and trigger https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/metrics_lifecycle.html#change-an-existing-metric

there is [Redis HLL](https://redis.io/commands/pfcount) and [Postgres HLL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/database/postgres_hll) In order to be able to calculate unions

Navigate to the Repository Analytics page (for a project): [`https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/graphs/master/charts`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/graphs/master/charts)\n1.

My proposal is that in the JS we check if the dropdown already has a path and if it does then we use that. Then if the path value is undefined, we can use the JS version. We'll remove passing the path from the file tree HAML so that page always uses the JS version, and we'll pass @path on the repository analytics page which has the value of an empty string so that we use the HAML provided path.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T13:56:23.066Z","updated_at":"2022-04-25T15:44:59.056Z","closed_at":"2022-04-25T15:30:30.853Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"labels":["Category:Code Analytics","Category:Code Testing and Coverage","SUS::Impacting","UX","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline insights","priority::4","section::ops","severity::4","type::bug","vintage","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"}],"author":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299317","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299317","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299317/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299317/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299317","relative":"#299317","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299317"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":77545910,"iid":299316,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add file breadcrumbs to Pipeline Editor","description":"This issue is to add file breadcrumbs to the Pipeline Editor.\n\n:link: [Specs on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bId8kFcqoAdmAYRatTZ0ii/PA-Pipeline-Editor-2nd-iteration?node-id=362%3A10401)\n\n![image](/uploads/2b0170ae36cc00d94ad77409ba0b6ad9/image.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T13:47:12.465Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T02:18:16.047Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T02:18:16.031Z","closed_by":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","Verify candidate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [-] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature. If there is no risk that the feature affects usability or server loads, skip to the global rollout.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n  - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T09:26:57.652Z","updated_at":"2021-06-02T07:36:36.169Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T07:36:36.153Z","closed_by":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","devops::secure","feature flag","frontend","group::threat insights","missed:13.12","missed:13.9","section::sec","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"}],"author":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299295","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":41,"completed_count":8},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 41 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299295","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299295/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299295/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299295","relative":"#299295","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299295"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77525807,"iid":299293,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update a Release through Release-CLI","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T09:07:33.109Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T09:56:05.906Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T09:56:05.585Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","GitLab Core","GitLab Release CLI","Next Up","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto updated","backend","devops::release","direction","documentation","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

dependencies. It returns a Marshaled array of the dependencies as a served file:\n\n```\nMarshal.dump([{:platform=\u003e\"ruby\",\n :dependencies=\u003e[],\n :name=\u003e\"test_gem\",\n :number=\u003e\"0.0.1\"}])\n```\n\nWhat happens is it is a recursive call, so if `test_gem` has two dependencies returned in the response, it will then make the same request with `?gems=dependency1,dependency2`. It will keep doing this until the response is empty. I'm not sure what the HEAD request does.\n\nThis route is documented at the bottom of the [RubyGems api docs](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/)\n\n### References\n\n* Install notes which include some info on this route are here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216517#note_485004481\n* A summary of all routes are listed here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216517#note_485886685\n* Main RubyGems issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/803\n* Investigation issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216517","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T04:10:00.156Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T13:23:00.483Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T13:21:40.220Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Package:P2","RubyGems Repository","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299282","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":1},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299282","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299282/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299282/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299282","relative":"#299282","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299282"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3200,"epic":{"id":49403,"iid":3200,"title":"Make the RubyGems Repository  generally available (GA)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3200","group_id":9970,"human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e758\u003c/strong\u003e days elapsed"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77506907,"iid":299265,"project_id":278964,"title":"[VSA] Include items that haven't reached the end event","description":"### Overview\n\nCurrently, the list of issues displayed for a given stage in VSA only includes issues that have reached the end event. \n\n### Problem to address\n\nExcluding issues that haven't reached the end event could show a stage time that is shorter than reality if I have issues that have been in the stage for a long time and haven't reached an end event yet.

Wherever the user has scrolled to at the time that they enter search criteria, that placement should remain   \n\n- **Options in the filter drop down not showing consistently**\n  - The styling isn't correct for the dropdown. It should be consistent with the styling found in the Labels of the right sidebar. The link text is blue as well as the checkmark. In the right sidebar, it appears this is resolved by the `color:inherit` being inherited from the right sidebar styles. \n  - There's also a `.gl-white-space-nowrap` being applied to the components that seems to be causing the content not to wrap within the dropdown. \n  - Lastly, the icon box shrinks when the label title is long which I believe is due to the parent `a` being a flex container. Adding `flex-shrink:0` to `.dropdown-label-box` should resolve that. This also needs to be done on the sidebar dropdown.\n\n- **Some pagination wonkiness**\n  - When the `Prev` and `Next` screens are selected in the pagination for each label group, the preloader shows briefly as they are loaded in which is causing a visual jump in the placement of the loaders.

If there is an \"Edit permissions\" in the user row, why isn't it usable? (And the same button works in the parent group where the LDAP sync is configured)\n\n(I seem to remember that the \"Edit permissions\" button was hidden for LDAP users in subgroups in older versions of GitLab, but if it's there I expect it to do something useful ;))","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-19T13:55:53.500Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T15:54:00.872Z","closed_at":"2021-02-01T18:28:58.419Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","customer","devops::manage","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","ldap","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"}],"author":{"id":577312,"username":"TobiX","name":"Tobias Gruetzmacher","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca05b989b1d5d2a3677d28ebaca87137?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/TobiX"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299179","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299179","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299179/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/299179/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#299179","relative":"#299179","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#299179"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77477468,"iid":299178,"project_id":278964,"title":"Implement refreshing cashed issues count in group sidebar after bulk operations","description":"## Summary\n\nExtend `Groups::OpenIssuesCountService` to include the ability to clear the cached count after a bulk operation has been done.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to use the API to query for \"Time to restore service\" data using an external tool. \n\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThe DORA4 metrics are 4 key metrics that have become industry standard for measuring DevOps success. In 14.9, the Manage stage will be adding API support for the final two metrics. Support via API allows external tools to poll GitLab and export the data. The third metrics is Time to restore a service which is measured as median time to close production incidents.\n\nAs an executive investing in DevOps, I want to see my ROI. I want to see an improvement in the time MRs to get merged of my dev team. This will most likely drive the KPIs of my team.\n\nAs a developer leader I want to see that the team is improving by measuring the Time to restore service and comparing it over time (over sprints)\n\nI want to import the data from GitLab into an external monitoring tool, so I need API support to poll the data.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to use the API to present the Time to restore service data in an external tool. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThe [project-level DORA key metrics API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dora/metrics.html) should accept a `metric` parameter value of `time_to_restore_service`.  In that case it should return \"Time to restore service\" values, calculated as the median duration in days (from open to close) of all `Incident` records closed in the given time period.  (See the [key metrics definitions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fourkeys#key-metrics-definitions) for more details on calculation.)\n\n### Out of scope\n\nIn the future we will add group level and instance level support.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nIn this milestone we have added the ability to get release by tag or name directly from the release-cli.

It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nThe `release-cli` is a simple HTTP client that makes API requests, it would be great to extend it to interact with the rest of the Release API endpoints.\n\nExtend the release-cli to get release.\n\nGet a Release by a tag name\nGet a Release for the given tag.\n\n`GET /projects/:id/releases/:tag_name`\n\n\n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

compare_reports Shell script to ruby","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nAs discussed in [Ensure keys match when comparing reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/186#note_485905716), it was noted that the [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script is becoming increasingly more complex and difficult to follow.\n\nNow that ruby unit tests are being added as part of [Ensure keys match when comparing reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/186), we should consider converting the `compare_reports.sh` script to use `ruby` instead.  \n\nThe purpose of this issue is to migrate the existing [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) to use `ruby`.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script will be easier to maintain and follow by other developers, and we can add more test coverage using standard `ruby` tools such as [`rspec`](https://rspec.info)\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Migrate the [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) to ruby\n1. Update all of the [QA YAML files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/tree/master/includes-dev) to use the new ruby script/command.\n1. Ensure all the existing QA tests still function as expected\n\nThe ruby script might still use `jq`, in which case replacing `jq` with plain ruby code will be done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299503.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Add QA script for DS, SD, and SAST to the [`integration-test` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333829), with tests for these. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/merge_requests/2.\n- [x] Update the Dependency Scanning QA template to execute these scripts and the `integration-test` Docker image. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/236\n- [x] Update README of [integration-test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test) project and cover job integration tests https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/merge_requests/5\n\nEnabling these scripts for SAST and Secret Detection is out of scope.\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-sast.yml\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-secret_detection.yml\n\n### Further details\n\n[compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/9aee1de0a744e49577d026f66f8164ba07fdef5d/scripts/compare_reports.sh) currently goes through the following steps:\n1. `sanitize_and_diff_reports`\n   1. filter the actual and expected reports using `jq` filters; the exact filter depends on the report type \n   1. compare the actual report to the expected report using `diff -u -b`\n   1. report an error and exit 1 if there's a diff\n1. `validate_report_json`\n   1. get the commit ref of `security-report-schemas` based on the version stored in the actual report\n   1. get the filename of the schema based on the type of the actual report\n   1. fetch the JSON schema\n   1. do JSON schema validation using Python\n   1. report an error and exit 65 if validation fails\n\nThese steps have already been ported to RSpec shared examples in [gemnasium!194](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/194/diffs):\n- `it_behaves_like` [`recorded report`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/513009c275d254ac1e2e2b6d8d1569d486471002/spec/support/shared_examples/report_shared_examples.rb#L48) compares the generated report with the expected one\n- `it_behaves_like` [`valid report`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/513009c275d254ac1e2e2b6d8d1569d486471002/spec/support/shared_examples/report_shared_examples.rb#L103) performs schema validation\n\nBut there are limitations:\n- These are RSpec shared examples, not a Ruby script that could be used in place of `compare_reports.sh`.\n- Report sanitization is specific to Dependency Scanning reports. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299503\n- Schema validation uses a local copy of the schema whereas `compare_reports.sh` fetches the schema that matches the report type and version.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nUnit tests will be added for the new ruby script.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nThe [compare_reports.sh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/49fc4c8b7103cfb1fdebf0b0c1f7de73186ff041/scripts/compare_reports.sh) script is replaced by a `ruby` script with unit tests.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" ~\"Enterprise Edition\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes, this affects all secure projects\n\n### Links /
