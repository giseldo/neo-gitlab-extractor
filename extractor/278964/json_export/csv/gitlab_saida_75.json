The hypothesis being that we will increase the form submission rate by reducing the number of fields the user has to submit to complete the form.\n\n \n# New hypothesis\nUsers are concerned about submitting a form that starts with company information like \"company name\" \"number of employees\" as it implies they are submitting the form on behalf of their company and not as an individual person/user of GitLab. Users would value seeing their previously submitting information while still enjoying a shorter form to submit. \n\n\n# Experiment design\nTo test this hypothesis we will test two designs vs the control experience as seen below: \n \n\n| Control | Non-editable group | Welcoming group |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|![image](/uploads/3c1dc7e3e8cc03d0ab17386c9550c868/image.png)

Copy change + hiding prefilled values |\n \nHowever, in this previous test shown above the control outperformed the experiment with statistically significant results, a full recap can be viewed here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/-/issues/281#note_540419469. \n\n# Oldest design \n\n| Control | Experiment |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|

and experiment groups\n* Users in the control should have known values in first, last name fields\n* Users in each experiment (one of three variant groups shown above) group should have values in the first, last name fields\n* For both the experiment and control groups (one of three variant groups shown above) track the unique views and the unique submissions of the form\n \nNote this tracking is the same as the tracking we used in the initial experiment with the only change being that we need to also track if the user/namespace was included in the control or variant 1 (non-editable) or variant 2 (variant -

We haven't officially tackled mobile views for those pages yet. Mobile views will become increasingly important, especially when we introduce paging.\n\nIn this issue we'll introduce basic mobile frameworks for on-call schedules and escalation policies.\n\nHere's how mobile on-call schedules look currently in the product:\n\n| Ex 1 | Ex 2 | Ex 3 (everything starts breaking) | Ex 4 (modals) | Ex 5 (modals) |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-06_at_9.00.13_AM](/uploads/c762a0810552ab7adf28aeaa59f86a75/Screen_Shot_2021-04-06_at_9.00.13_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-06_at_9.01.07_AM](/uploads/378de5db80f7e9b03a3767c5f1d75069/Screen_Shot_2021-04-06_at_9.01.07_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.40.02_AM](/uploads/a7b85100064063ba756a96426d0949a4/Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.40.02_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.40.47_AM](/uploads/76785044458ce5e4622f4baa4154ca35/Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.40.47_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.41.24_AM](/uploads/e85604b7e4f6dee2fb1716762e02e8ca/Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.41.24_AM.png) |\n\n### Goals for V1\n\nPrimarily, we want to have these views break a little less than they do now :sweat_smile: \n\nBeyond that - users will likely be viewing and editing schedule rotations on mobile, for instance to see who is on-call in the upcoming shifts, or when replacing someone who is/will be on-call soon. There are two scenarios in which we expect this is likely to occur:\n\n- A manager is double checking to ensure there is proper coverage of on-call shifts (for example, if a team member has called in sick or the manager wants to add someone or change someone around, etc). \n- An IC going in to verify and/or edit their own on-call shift.\n\nAs a first pass, we will support these two scenarios by ensuring the calendar content is the primary content on the page, and putting any \"supportive content\" out of immediate view. \n\nAdditional steps to support these scenarios:\n- In places where we have multiple buttons on larger screen-sizes that are unlikely to be used on mobile, combining them into a single button (ex - putting the edit and delete schedules behind a single \"more actions\" button)\n- Putting the rotation label and the rotation buttons in separate rows, so the rotation participants can take the full width of the screen.\n- Rather than displaying a full 24 hours or a full two weeks as we do on larger screens, only displaying _either_ an hourly or a weekly view. Limiting those views to 8 hours in the hourly view, or 7 days in the weekly view.\n\n### Designs for On-Call Schedules\n\nFollowing general mobile design patterns in the product, we could introduce mobile states for the on-call schedule page:\n\n| Schedule | Schedule dropdown | View dropdown | Rotation action dropdown | Add schedule button (when it's added| Modal example | Empty state |\n| ------ | ------ |  ------ | ------ |  ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|![Schedule](/uploads/61a4fc8f87630950e9624b6bb4e275ca/Schedule.png) | ![Schedule_dropdown](/uploads/a0213a72b6565488368d94f7c4e4574e/Schedule_dropdown.png) | ![View_dropdown](/uploads/ab4e2e6dfefbb26d9535971339d7fb15/View_dropdown.png) | ![Rotation_action_dropdown](/uploads/2f95fdc464b17272ac35c869e267bb89/Rotation_action_dropdown.png) | ![Add_a_schedule_button__when_it_s_added_](/uploads/ae4a7c13243ae1c265dee91b5e1434e3/Add_a_schedule_button__when_it_s_added_.png) |![Modal_pattern](/uploads/a05c05698400c5ac5dd4bead9fd5f748/Modal_pattern.png) | ![Empty_state](/uploads/2c6049c74351f401029d046562c5cda1/Empty_state.png)|\n\n### Designs for Escalation Policies\n\nFollowing these patterns, we could also introduce mobile states for the escalation policies page:\n\n| Escalation policy | Modal example | Empty state |\n| ------ | ------ |  ------ |\n| ![Escalation](/uploads/0cb93cb450fb194c9ea74defb7439352/Escalation.png) | ![Modal_designs](/uploads/98c2ba323ea45a243da0443a2d5ae412/Modal_designs.png)|![Empty_state](/uploads/847a9ba9f0d5170b04382b919d7fc361/Empty_state.png) |\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/v7MuRq550tDL5ZRFVLp9bu/Mobile-designs-on-call-schedules-gitlab-com-and-327021?node-id=912%3A44969)\n\n### Ideas for future improvements\n\nWhen discussing this, we talked about how it would be nice to see who is on call now and/or when \"I\" am next on call. This seems like it could be nice to have on all screen sizes, but that it might also be challenging to figure out how to display, since you can have many rotations and many schedules on a single page. So, a single call-out likely will not work.

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen analyzing SAML usage data, I found that [more than half of the groups using group SAML don't enforce it](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/636494/Dev:-Manage:-Access-SAML-SSO-Usage?widget=11401535\u0026udv=0). This was unexpected as I believe that if a customer goes through setup they would want to enforce it to make sure their group is protected.\n\nWe previously did not make it default to avoid user lockout. We have enabled [owners to access the groups outside of SAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211962) so we have mitigated this risk. \n\n### Proposal \n\nCan we start by making enforcement the default behavior for new groups. If SSO is enabled, then we automatically toggle the two enforcement toggles below (UI and Git enforcement). The user can choose to disable it if they want. \n\nShould we present a warning if they disable it? \"Disabling SAML enforcement may allow users to access your group without authenticating through your SAML provider\". \n\n![Frame_64](/uploads/3bc9ce95bff5b0d83a7fde9ee30f59e4/Frame_64.png)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n#### Default the `Enforce SSO-only authentication for web activity for this group.` toggle to `on`\n\n* Add `self.enforced_sso = true` to [ee/app/models/saml_provider.rb#L108](/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/saml_provider.rb#L108)\n* Update spec at [ee/spec/models/saml_provider_spec.rb#L124](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/spec/models/saml_provider_spec.rb#L124)\n\n#### Display a message if enforcement isn't enabled\n\n* Add \"**Warning** - Disabling SAML enforcement may be a security risk.\" message to [app/views/groups/saml_providers/_form.html.haml#L16](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/views/groups/saml_providers/_form.html.haml#L16).\n* In the [`updateToggles` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/saml_providers/saml_settings_form.js#L118), show/hide the message.\n* Update specs in [ee/spec/frontend/saml_providers/saml_settings_form_spec.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/spec/frontend/saml_providers/saml_settings_form_spec.js)\n\n#### Convert toggles to checkboxes\n\n- Change `f.hidden_field` to `f.check_box` in [app/views/groups/saml_providers/_form.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/views/groups/saml_providers/_form.html.haml) and remove any unnecessary toggle markup. \n- Remove [`setupToggleButtons`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/saml_providers/saml_settings_form.js#L4) as it will no longer be needed.\n- Update any selectors in failing feature/QA specs","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-06T16:04:41.239Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T16:05:52.603Z","closed_at":"2021-05-12T15:13:00.946Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"labels":["GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","Technical Writing","UI text","devops::manage","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","section::dev","tw::finished","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"}],"author":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter Hegman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/459d8635e9ab17a052c00ead1d7bf1e6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/peterhegman"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327020","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327020","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327020/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/327020/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#327020","relative":"#327020","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#327020"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":84725392,"iid":327019,"project_id":278964,"title":"Perform Audit - identify and address underperforming SQL queries (Composition Analysis)","description":"## Audit the codebase in your area\n\nPlease complete this [audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325440#instructions).

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Override default branch to a branch other than `master`\n2. Create a project that will have the compliance pipeline configuration path file defined\n3. Create compliance pipeline configuration path file (for e.g. `.compliance-gitlab-ci.yml` in the project created in Set (2)\n4. Create a Compliance framework and try setting compliance pipeline configuration path to the file created in Set (3)\n\nObserve the validation fails, indicating file does not exist.\n\nThanks to @aregnery for creating a video outlining the problem:\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/33435a3ef2bc4622b737cad82e024719\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nSetting of Compliance pipeline configuration fails when default branch is not `master`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nValidate Compliance pipeline configuration path in the compliance project's default branch\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-05T16:39:35.668Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T18:07:40.282Z","closed_at":"2021-04-09T12:49:55.800Z","closed_by":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","frontend","group::compliance","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"}],"author":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4014344/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aishbuilds"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326923","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326923","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326923/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326923/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#326923","relative":"#326923","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#326923"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3156,"epic":{"id":45158,"iid":3156,"title":"Allow group owners to define compliance pipeline configurations at the group level","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3156","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":84649602,"iid":326918,"project_id":278964,"title":"Bad UX on To-Do List after page specific bundle","description":"tl; dr: 63.56 % code of `app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles/todos.scss` is eliminated in !60784\n\n### Summary\n\nBad UX on To-Do List after page specific bundle (!38890).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

scheduling for batched background migrations","description":"After initial production testing of batched migrations, we have a few improvements that can be made immediately.\n\n#### Allow short variance when scheduling next job\n\n* [X] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58580\n\nA current limitation of the `sidekiq-cron` scheduling is that it only polls for jobs once per minute. Since the interval between jobs is often configured at an even minute value, this results in the cron missing the execution of the next job by a matter of seconds.\n\nIn practice, we saw a migration with a configured interval of 2 minutes running jobs at mostly a 3 minute interval. In order to work around this problem, we can add a small variance when checking if the interval has elapsed since the last job. If we're within a reasonable window of the next execution (a few seconds), we should execute the job.\n\n#### Increase timeout on `ExclusiveLease`\n\n* [X] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58578\n\nWe currently takeout an `ExclusiveLease` in the `BatchedBackgroundMigrationWorker` to ensure we only have single-thread execution of background jobs. The timeout for this lease is currently set at two times the job interval.\n\nHowever, in a production incident where database response times could drop considerably, the lease could likely expire before the job has finished its work, resulting in multiple jobs executing in parallel. To avoid this add-on effect, we should increase the timeout on the lease to a more conservative value.\n\nThis shouldn't impact operation during normal execution, as the lease is released when the job finishes.\n\n#### Make pause time configurable\n\n* [X] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58583\n\nWhen processing a batched background migration, we have two batching values, the `batch_size` and `sub_batch_size`. The `batch_size` is used to find the boundaries for each background job that executes. The `sub_batch_size` is used inside the background job, to process the outer batch in small pieces to keep query times low.\n\nThis strategy seems to work well, and we include a small sleep between each sub batch, to slow operations on the database. However, there is an upper limit on `sub_batch_size` that is determined by execution time on the database. At the same time, we may be able to increase the overall `batch_size` by large amounts, especially when processing in off-peak hours.\n\nUnfortunately, the more batches we process, the more time the job spends pausing between each individual query, which can ultimately dominate the total execution time of the job. We should make the pause time a configurable value too, so that we can increase or decrease as necessary.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-02T21:55:44.517Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:33:02.371Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T16:59:44.816Z","closed_by":{"id":1982738,"username":"iroussos","name":"Yannis

endpoints don't get an actual file.\n\nWhy is it so?\n\nThis is coming from how `mvn` (the main client) works. When you setup multiple registries for your dependencies and pull them, `mvn` will loop on *each* registry and `knock, knock do you have package X`?\n\nIn other words, the GitLab maven package registry receives many requests for packages/files that are not hosted in GitLab but elsewhere. My guess is that the majority of them are in maven central but due to how `mvn` works, GitLab get \"pinged\" too.\n\n### :bulb: Proposal (Friday's Crazy Idea #8649134)\n\nGiven that those `404`s account for more than 75% of the requests. What if we take a few moment to have a preliminary check:\n\n* given a maven path (the parameters we receive on the file endpoints), does a `Packages::Maven::Metadatum` record exists?\n   * If no, we can right away reply `404`s.\n   * If yes, execute the actual endpoint logic as it is today.\n\nThat's a simple existence check. There is no authentication, authorization checks. There is no queries to the packages table. It's just a simple answer to a simple question: does the path `my/path/bananas` exists in the table?\n\nWhy can we take the luxury of checking the `packages_maven_metadata` table first? One word: size. The `packages_maven_metadata` table is not a busy one such as `projects` or `packages`. We thus have way less records = scanning that table with a maven path is super fast.\n\nActually, I'm thinking that this could be the explanation why [the instance level endpoints are faster than the project level endpoints](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326094).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-02T16:00:45.037Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T10:39:22.701Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T10:50:35.985Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","GitLab.com Priority","Maven Repository","Mechanical Sympathy","Package:P1","backend","bug::performance","devops::package","feature flag","gitlab.com","group::package registry","infradev","package:active","priority::3","production request","ruby","section::ops","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326819","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326819","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326819/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326819/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#326819","relative":"#326819","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#326819"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":82204873,"iid":326817,"project_id":278964,"title":"Extract allowlist logic to its own class","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.

Mass deletion of large proportion of projects leads to runaway `geo:geo_repository_destroy` queue","description":"## Problem\n\n* I mass inserted 500k fake project records to test a DB query.\n* The secondary created a registry record for each project record (good).\n* I mass deleted all fake project records, leaving me with 51 real projects.\n* The secondary `Geo::Secondary::RegistryConsistencyWorker` enqueues 10k `GeoRepositoryDestroyWorker` per run (up to every 5 seconds, or a bit less if execution takes more than 5 seconds)\n\nOn my dev setup, `geo:geo_repository_destroy` is drained slower than it is added to, so the queue grows uncontrolled until the number of deleteable registry records is somewhat lower than the remaining number of registry records.\n\n## Possible solutions\n\nIdea: Make `RegistryConsistencyWorker` mark registries for deletion instead of enqueuing jobs. Then add a worker to delete registries which are marked for deletion. Note this requires a new field on all registry tables. Weight 4.\n\nAnother idea: Make `RegistryConsistencyWorker` delete synchronously, with one mass delete query (it's already capped at a batch of 10000), since currently `GeoRepositoryDestroyWorker` jobs enqueued by `RegistryConsistencyWorker` do not have the ability to find and delete the repository anyway. Weight 1.\n\n## Workaround\n\nA workaround is to delete the `geo:geo_repository_destroy` queue when it grows too large, but this may delete jobs enqueued by other sources (events), and therefore can lead to orphaned repository data on the secondary.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-02T02:30:31.769Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T00:45:01.001Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T03:02:52.420Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","devops::systems","group::geo","section::enablement","severity::4","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWhen rendering very large MRs, the performance deteriorates immensely.\n\nTheoretically, by removing the number of nodes in the page we can reduce the amount of watchers/getters/setters currently on the page and the rendering load of having so many DOM nodes.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nLarge Merge Requests perform better.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n1. Use virtual scrolling to hide Diff Files distant from the viewport\n   * Hiding can be partial (only parts of the diff file are removed) or complete (the whole diff file is removed)\n1. Render diff files as user scrolls through the page, never noticing the are being rendered as they go.\n\n### Further details\n\nPerformance bottlenecks and impact to monitor:\n\nGoals:\n\n* TBT metric going down\n* Memory usage going down\n* No sluggishness while user scrolls\n* No feature is broken\n* (ideally) Native browser search can still find important parts, like the diff lines or notes.\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n--\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\nFaster Large MRs and better performance while interacting with the page.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo, Code Review only. However, virtual scrolling might exist elsewhere in the project or at least there might be other areas interested in using this solution.\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

packages.","description":"### Summary\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/57600, we modified the maven package finder to improve its efficiency.\n\nOne of the improvements made was to implement https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/287638 by using an [existing finder helper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/app/finders/concerns/packages/finder_helper.rb).\n\nThis causes an issue for the group level maven api.\n\nGiven this situation:\n\nGroup    -\u003e   Subgroup     -\u003e    Project\n\nBefore https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/57600:\n\nReporters of `Subgroup` could pull packages from `Project` by using the group level endpoint and targeting `Group`.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\n* Users [need](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/lib/api/maven_packages.rb#L149) the `read_group` permission on the target group (`Group`).\n    * This is [granted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/app/policies/group_policy.rb#L95-97) by the group policy which basically says if a user has access to any of the subprojects, it has access to the root group with the `read_group` permission.\n* Users [need](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/lib/api/maven_packages.rb#L153) the `read_package` permission on the project (`Project`).\n    * This is granted by the usual role system where reporters of `Subgroup` will be reporters on the contained projects.\n    * The above will [grant](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/app/policies/project_policy.rb#L261) the `read_package` permission\n\n\nAfter https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/57600:\n\nThe same scenario will now fail.\n\n* Users [need](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/lib/api/maven_packages.rb#L149) the `read_group` permission on the target group (`Group`).\n    * Same as before\n* Users [need](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f043ace969a4c1488b9b14373ea86b0c49182ed4/lib/api/maven_packages.rb#L153) the `read_package` permission on the project (`Project`).\n    * Same as before\n* In addition, users [need](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f4e9203f9567e233d3269b177e2634f64271466e/app/finders/concerns/packages/finder_helper.rb#L14) `read_package` on the target group (`Group`)\n    * This is a new check\n    * `read_package` on groups is only [granted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f4e9203f9567e233d3269b177e2634f64271466e/app/policies/group_policy.rb#L132) to direct reporters (or public groups).\n        * Reporters of `Subgroup` will not have this :boom: \n\n\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1. We could grant `read_package` the [same way](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f4e9203f9567e233d3269b177e2634f64271466e/app/policies/group_policy.rb#L96) that `read_group` is granted for a Group but that will open things too much to my taste. This increases the risk of leaking private objects.\n1. We can modify the package finder helper to enforce `read_group` instead of `read_package`.\n    * This would mimic the same set of permissions checked for Maven APIs before the MR.\n    * The package finder helper is also used by NuGet packages but this is fine as nuget APIs directly [check](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f4e9203f9567e233d3269b177e2634f64271466e/lib/api/concerns/packages/nuget_endpoints.rb#L60) the `read_package` permission on the group.\n\nSolution (2.) is the best one.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-01T07:40:06.304Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T07:24:04.812Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T07:24:04.745Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David

authenticated scans against web applications that use popup login forms","description":"\n### Problem to solve \n\nMany websites use a popup/modal for the login form. The process to login is navigation to the home page, click sign in, and enter the username/password into the popup.\n\nThis issue proposes adding an option to the authentication configuration to allow users to click an element prior to entering the login details.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen Browserker navigations to `AuthDetails.LoginURL`, it should check to see if the new configuration value `AuthDetails.LoginSelector` exists on the page. If it is present, the selector should be clicked. The resulting form should be filled out by the normal Browserker authentication process.\n\nThis should work for manual and auto login attempts.\n\nUpdate: The user should be able to supply a list of selectors. Each selector will be clicked on. This allows user to click to open the menu, then click on sign in, as an example.\n\n### Documentation\n\nPlease update the Browserker configuration documentation.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n[Gold/Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] After loading the login URL in `captureLoginPage`, actions should be followed using `crawler.Process`\n- [x] For each new processed action, new Navigations should be captured\n- [x] A section should be added to the report for each login action step\n- [x] Add an end-to-end test to ensure that users can log in with popup login forms\n- [x] Likely have to adjust an end to end test fixture (pancakes?) to have a login form\n- [x] Add documentation for the feature in the browser-based DAST configuration section.\n\nAssigning a weight of `5`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-01T02:39:58.781Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T04:30:45.385Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T08:57:09.904Z","closed_by":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron

We should minimize the potential impact of this greater processing volume.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDevOps Adoption data should be re-calculated weekly (instead of daily) per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326008#note_541187577.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-31T21:19:24.306Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T10:40:35.208Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T10:40:34.722Z","closed_by":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","feature::enhancement","group::optimize","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326558","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326558","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326558/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326558/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#326558","relative":"#326558","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#326558"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":82048334,"iid":326549,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rollout `gldropdown_branches` feature flag","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Feature\n\nThis feature uses the `:gldropdown_branches` feature flag, this feature only changes a dropdown and an input box from the `Repository -\u003e Branches` page on projects, impact should be minimal as there are no changes from the current functionality of the page, just some component migrations.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n- [Replace bootstrap dropdown in app/views/projects/branches/index.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263191)\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::continuous integration\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_ci`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @jivanvl \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how the feature should be rolled out, and check the right boxes.

form: Pre-fill phone number field based on country selected.","description":"## Problem\nDefined in [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5699).\n\n## Proposed solution\n#### MVC Approach\n*  Update the telephone field with the country prefix regardless of the values the user may or may not have entered into the phone number field, i.e. we delete all values a replace it with only the new prefix.\n* If a user deletes the prefix and simply enters a telephone number then we respect/trust their manual input\n* Per Dallas' findings [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326452#note_542083281) we can add further validation of acceptable symbols and require the phone number length to be between 7 and 15

Maybe it's good time to revisit this issue.\n\nThere is also inconsistency in code that there is no SSOT facility to fetch-and-filter environments i.e. some places use the finder, the other places directly access `Environment` model without using the finder. So that the performance issue tends to appear sparsely across different domains. Ideally, Release group provides a SSOT facility and we keep maintaining the finder with decent optimization for the other domains.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-31T08:08:01.217Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T10:26:57.872Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T10:26:57.861Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya

explicitly listed\"","description":"## Problem\n\nWe should consider reverting the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225482 feature. As we [discussed with a customer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/pre-sales/finra/-/issues/2), it turned out that the proposed solution won't work for them. They need more strategic permission/resource control, such as [Group-level permissions config for Protected Environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888).\n\nThe main problem is that this feature is conceptually broken due to the environment centric approch. It doesn't respect the system-level [CI permissions and GitLab RBAC](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html), and result in skipping some important permission checks. This is simply hard to be used in a large organization because the permissions given to the operator group is insufficient in most of the cases, for example, operators (as reporter) can't access to the runner's setting for production deployment, where they should have an access. We should take into account of the CI resource boundary for operators, instead of looking at only job execution.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323794 for more information.\n\n## Proposal\n\nRevert [Allow reporters to run jobs that deploy to an environments if they are explicitly listed\n](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225482) (In documentation, [Environment access by group membership](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#environment-access-by-group-membership)). Specifically, the following MRs:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38188 (Implementation)\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39733 (Documentation)\n\n[[UPDATE 05 Jul 2021]](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326447#note_618457390)\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nSadly, we don't have a viable alternative solution in this case. If we address this problem properly, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1896 or https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280534 should be addressed instead, however, this requires many effort (probably that's the reason why we fell back to [the workaround feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888)).\n\nI realized that the feature in question can also be combined with [the group-level protected environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888) to effectively prevent operators from accessing repositories while still allowing them to execute deployment jobs (This still doesn't resolve [the problem on CI/CD resource management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326447#problem) so I'm skeptical how this can fit in an actual enterprise org). But this specific access control *might* be required by [a prospect](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331085#note_613842171), so it'd be better NOT to revert this feature now. We should consider the revert after the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1896 or https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280534 has been addressed.\n\nIn that sense, I'll mark this issue as blocked by these issues.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Related\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-31T07:51:46.042Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T10:27:35.120Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T10:27:35.106Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P2","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","bug::performance","devops::release","group::release","priority::3","section::ops","security","severity::3","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
