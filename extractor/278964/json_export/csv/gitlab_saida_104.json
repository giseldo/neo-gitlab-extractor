We also want to fully delete the user to avoid pressurizing the Users table:\n\n- [ ] @shinya.maeda started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43605#note_426072666):\n\n    \u003e Removing the project membership doesn't cleanup a bot user itself. This design lets malicious users create many bot accounts (formatted by `project_{project_id}_bot`), which could be a threat model to pressurize the capacity of `users` table.\n\nChecking that the member is a bot, then converting them to a ghost, then destroying the user within `RemoveExpiredMembersWorker` is unperformant:\n\n- [ ] @shinya.maeda started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43605#note_428808393)\n\n    \u003e This [checking if member is bot then converting to ghost then destroying the user] causes N+1 problem that `SELECT * FROM users WHERE ...` query is executed for each expired member. If this is a desired process, at least we need to execute the process in [batch-style](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/merge_request_performance_guidelines.html#batch-process).\n\n    \u003e This doubles up [the N+1 problem](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/query_recorder.html). Can we avoid this query by reusing the selected user above?\n\n    \u003e This also causes N+1 for `DELETE FROM users ...`. Can we use batch style like mentioned above?\n\n    \u003e I'm not sure if this is a service supposed to be called.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-13T14:26:39.812Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T08:42:18.694Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T15:22:54.465Z","closed_by":{"id":444,"username":"dzaporozhets","name":"Dmytro Zaporozhets (DZ)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/444/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzaporozhets"},"labels":["Alliances - AWS","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"}],"author":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267158","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/267158","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/267158/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/267158/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#267158","relative":"#267158","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#267158"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72646552,"iid":267140,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add check if user is bot to Users API","description":"\n### Problem to solve \n\nThis is a follow-up from [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44085#note_428796085)\n\nWith the recent introduction of `Security bot` we added changes to Users popup to show some specific information about bots. Now the check if User is a bot is performed on the frontend, but this is ~\"technical debt\" and it has to be changed.\n\n We need to expose info if the user is a bot (Boolean). That change will help to show specific info about bots and increase the credibility of bots.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software

Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nMake GitLab bots more credible.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe need to add change to [GET /users/:id](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#single-user) to expose info if the user is a bot (Boolean).\n\n#### Implementation plan\n- [ ] In `lib/api/users.rb` Update 'Get the currently authenticated user' endpoint\n  - [ ] Update `Entities::UserPublic` by adding exposing of `bot` field. `expose :bot?, as: :bot do |user| user.bot?\n- [ ] Update tests for `lib/api/users.rb`\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change in permissions. \n\n### Documentation\n\nWe need to add a new field to [the api doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#single-user)\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nneed to add relevant tests for the api endpoint and serializers.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nTBA\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nSame as buyer of auto-fix feature.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes, ~\"group::composition analysis\" is working on Security bot, but in general bots belong to ~\"group::access\" \n\n### Links / references\n\n[discussion about the need of this

This can be obtained via `Group#self_and_descendents`.\n     * `group_name` is in the array of group names from the IdP\n  1. Worker adds the user as a member of the groups at the respective access level.\n\n**NOTE:** The last MR (if there are multiple MRs in this issue) should default enable the `:saml_group_links` feature flag introduced in !45080. We can keep the feature flag around for a while in case we need to disable the feature for any reason. \n\nDuring implementation we should consider how to make the worker and/or service classes reusable for other sync-on-sign-in solutions, such as for OAuth.\n\nEverything built here can also be used for instance-level sync. The only difference needed, as an example, is to pass a `nil` value for top-level group ID for the worker. In this case the worker can query for *any* group in the whole instance by name and add members accordingly. And instead of the worker being kicked off from `Gitlab::Auth::GroupSaml::User` it is called from `Gitlab::Auth::Saml::User`. We should keep this in mind during implementation, especially during the worker creation phase so the parameters and usage feels natural for either case.\n\nThe supported way to pass groups via SAML will be the same as is currently supported for self-managed admin and external groups: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/saml.html#requirements\n\n```xml\n    \u003csaml2:AttributeStatement\u003e\n      \u003csaml2:Attribute Name=\"Groups\" NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic\"\u003e\n        \u003csaml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"xs:string\"\u003eEveryone\u003c/saml2:AttributeValue\u003e\n        \u003csaml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"xs:string\"\u003eDBlessing Test Group\u003c/saml2:AttributeValue\u003e\n      \u003c/saml2:Attribute\u003e\n    \u003c/saml2:AttributeStatement\u003e\n```\n\nIn the initial implementation we should only support attribute statements with the name 'Groups'. Later we can make this configurable like it is for self-managed. For self-managed, the 'Groups' are obtained from the auth_hash (see [`Gitlab::Auth::Saml::AuthHash`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6708856194b9aa1d7441d7da87ec7722e13bace7/lib/gitlab/auth/saml/auth_hash.rb#L7)).\n\n### Further details\n\nThis is an Ultimate level feature.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. \n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs part of SAML group sync, we need to have a place within groups to set up group mapping. The setup experience will be similar to [LDAP group mapping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#manage-group-memberships-via-ldap). \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers are able to map groups from their idp to gitlab groups.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a new table `saml_group_links` where `group_name` corresponds to the SAML IdP provided group names and `group_id` corresponds to the GitLab group this link belongs to.\n\n  ```sql\n  CREATE TABLE saml_group_links (\n    id integer NOT NULL,\n    group_name character varying NOT NULL,\n    access_level integer NOT NULL,\n    group_id integer NOT NULL,\n    created_at timestamp without time zone,\n    updated_at timestamp without time zone\n  );\n  ```\n* Each GitLab group can have multiple group links at a specific access level. If a user matches multiple group links for the same GitLab group we use the max access level.\n* Create a new 'SAML Group Links' submenu under 'Settings'. This new menu item and page will be accessible on *all* subgroups when SAML SSO is enabled. UI will be similar to [LDAP Group Links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#creating-group-links-via-cn) and will consist of a form with the following fields and a list of all existing group links:\n  * Group Name: Corresponds to group names that will be sent from SAML IdP\n  * Access Level: 'Developer', 'Maintainer', etc\n\nThe end goal of the attached epic is that the group name from the `SamlGroupLink` will be matched with the group name passed by the IdP as in the example below. Users will then be assigned the `access_level` specified in the `SamlGroupLink`.\n\nThe supported way to pass groups via SAML will be the same as is currently supported for self-managed admin and external groups: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/saml.html#requirements\n\n```xml\n    \u003csaml2:AttributeStatement\u003e\n      \u003csaml2:Attribute Name=\"Groups\" NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic\"\u003e\n        \u003csaml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"xs:string\"\u003eEveryone\u003c/saml2:AttributeValue\u003e\n        \u003csaml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"xs:string\"\u003eDBlessing Test Group\u003c/saml2:AttributeValue\u003e\n      \u003c/saml2:Attribute\u003e\n    \u003c/saml2:AttributeStatement\u003e\n```\n\nIn this initial implementation, we only support attribute statements with the name 'Groups'.

both off and on.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n\n### Links /

search window doesn't get correct focus.","description":"### Edit Feb 3, 2021\n\nby: @jboyson \n\nI've moved my comment up here for more visibility. Below is what I found researching potential causes for this issue. Given that, myself and others cannot recreate the problem and the very narrow situation that I can see this happening, I am closing this issue.\n\nI suspect that some interruption in javascript processing delayed the file input getting focus. It is possible that some other change unknowingly corrected this problem.\n\nIf you run into it again, please open another issue, thanks! :bow: \n\nI've done some discovery and I can only think of one obscure way for this to happen.\n\n**NOTE: I have not been able to actually reproduce this. This is purely speculation.**\n\n`s` is the keyboard shortcut for focusing on the search bar. It is technically possible to focus the search bar if `s` is pressed after the page loads, but before the file input is focused. Maybe if something had hung up the javascript.\n\nNotice in the example video that it is highly likely that `s` was the first key pressed.\n\nI am not sure how to address this if we can't reproduce the problem. We could do something really heavy-handed like disabling the `s` shortcut on the find file page, but I am **strongly** against this idea.\n\n## Details\n\n- Pressing `t` just loads a URL. The shortcut itself does not set any focus.\n- The find path input is focused on page load here: `app/assets/javascripts/project_find_file.js:52`\n\nOnly three events focus the search input:\n\n1. Clicking the search input\n2. Clicking the clear button (the `x`) after text is entered into the search input\n3. Pressing `s` on the keyboard\n\nSee `app/assets/javascripts/search_autocomplete.js` lines 410 and 467\nand `app/assets/javascripts/behaviors/shortcuts/shortcuts.js:183`\n\nSince both of those are click events it should not be possible for the search bar to auto focus.\n\n### Summary\n\nIf you press t to search through the files in the directory tree the focus ends up on the wrong textbox\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPress t, type something, the focus is on the Search or jump to... box\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe focus is on the Search or jump to box\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe focus should be on the Find by path input.\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_5.38.49_PM](/uploads/2ac520695e0a6d827d79f871ab75e008/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_5.38.49_PM.png)\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_5.39.09_PM](/uploads/cf1b2397a4532c4940ce2a8267cf8795/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_5.39.09_PM.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-10T16:39:39.860Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T19:38:44.719Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T18:51:28.630Z","closed_by":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"labels":["Deliverable","UX","awaiting feedback","bug::transient","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","needs investigation","priority::3","repository","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":697507,"username":"magicaltrout","name":"Tom Barber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/697507/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/magicaltrout"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/265089","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/265089","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/265089/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/265089/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#265089","relative":"#265089","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#265089"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72483734,"iid":264787,"project_id":278964,"title":"File/folder menu in Web IDE is not shown entirely","description":"## Problem to Solve\n\nThe file tree in the Web IDE is sized to the number of files in the project.

Define a pipeline job with an environment that should be persistent\n2. Set `environment:auto_stop_in` to \"never\"\n3. Lint the CI script\n\n### Example Project\n\nI have not created an example project as the issue can be reproduced with the CI Linter in any project.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe current behaviour is that the linting fails with the error:\n\n```\njobs:deploy_persistent:environment auto stop in should be a duration\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAccording to the documentation, \"never\" should be a valid duration and therefore the linting should succeed.\n\nI'd expect that an environment created by a job with `auto_stop_in` set to \"never\" would have no \"auto stop in\" time set, identically to what would happen if the \"pin\" button had been pressed.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n[gitlab-ci-environment-auto_stop_in-never-bug](/uploads/53875257eaf9cd6cdc7d58e8641709dd/gitlab-ci-environment-auto_stop_in-never-bug.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWhen the \"environment:auto_stop_in\" key was added it was set to be a \"duration\" type value: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19931/diffs#e847be0aa4579071063b7903a5e8b6eafa8228b0_52_52 (Current code: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/config/entry/environment.rb#L52)\nHowever the \"artifacts:expire_in\" key uses it's own custom parser: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/config/entry/artifacts.rb#L45\n\nI suspect that the correct fix here is for the `environment:auto_stop_in` key to use the same parser and logic as the `artifacts:expire_in` key.\n\nHowever it's also possible that this particular feature - creating environments without an expiry time - is unwanted and the protected environment feature should be used instead, in which case the correct solution here is to update the documentation to make it explicit that `environment:auto_stop_in` _must_ be a duration and \"never\" isn't allowed.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow a user to define `when: never`as part of `auto-stop` in","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-09T01:18:22.588Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T12:14:46.126Z","closed_at":"2022-07-08T12:28:37.990Z","closed_by":{"id":9396342,"username":"acook.gitlab","name":"Allen Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9396342/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acook.gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Environment Management","Deliverable","Next Up","Release::P1","backend","backend-weight::1","customer","devops::release","group::release","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":9396342,"username":"acook.gitlab","name":"Allen Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9396342/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acook.gitlab"}],"author":{"id":4049639,"username":"julian-cbc","name":"Julian Calaby","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4049639/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/julian-cbc"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9396342,"username":"acook.gitlab","name":"Allen Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9396342/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acook.gitlab"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/264198","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/264198","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/264198/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/264198/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#264198","relative":"#264198","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#264198"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72417815,"iid":263778,"project_id":278964,"title":"Migrate postgresql from stable Helm repo (which is going away Nov 13, 2020)","description":"https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/10/07/important-reminder-for-all-helm-users-stable-incubator-repos-are-deprecated-and-all-images-are-changing-location/\n\nOn Nov 13, 2020 the [stable repository](https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/index.yaml) will be gone -

We've continued to improve the feature and today tens of thousands of node packages are published to and installed from the registry each day, more if you count packages installed using the [npm request forwarding feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#forwarding-requests-to-npmjsorg), which will look in the public registry for any packages not found in your GitLab registry. In addition, you can now authenticate with your personal access, job, deploy (group or project), and project access tokens.\n\nAnd in %\"13.6\" we will add a project level endpoint that supports all npm commands, so you won't have to maintain `publishconfig` in each package.json. \n\nIt's not all :sunny: and :rainbow: though. We don't yet support caching external dependencies and when a package is pulled using the request forwarding, we don't pass that data to the front end. But those are things we are working on over the next several months. (check https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3608 for more details)\n\nOK so,  I'd like to reevaluate what has to be true for GitLab.com to dogfood the npm registry.

Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n1. An automated test will be added to verify that Container Scanning works for FIPS-enabled images\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs an application development director/manager, I want to navigate to a single page to see the current test coverage of all projects in a group, so I can report that data on demand quickly as needed.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to use the UI within GitLab to see a single value of test coverage for all projects in a group.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n#### Backend\n- **This feature is for EE.**\n- **This feature is behind the ~\"feature flag\" `group_coverage_data_report_graph`.**\n- **This should be for the `default` branch only for each project.**\n* Create the GroupCodeCoverage (or a better name) GraphQL entity **for today**\n  - Total projects\n  - Average coverage\n  - Total jobs\n* The entity should contain the fields required (total projects, average coverage, total jobs) to represent at least the top three numbers in the design, but we should keep in mind that we are going to move on towards implementing the graph next. So the historical information, if added easily, should also be added. If it is more complex, we can put a pin in it until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215140.\n\n\n#### Frontend\n* Add an \"Overall Activity\" section to the Repositories Analytics page (see attached design)\n  * In this section, display three coverage statistics for the group (using GraphQL to get the data):\n    * `Projects with Tests`\n    * `Average Coverage by Job` (final name TBD)\n    * `Total Number of Coverages`\n  * Potentially, add a [GlAreaChart](https://design.gitlab.com/data-visualization/charts/code) below these statistics displaying just one data point for today's average coverage (which we will expand out to show the historical coverage trend in #215140)\n\n### Further details\n\n* This iteration of the feature does not include sub-group projects. That will be [done later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273527).\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThe permissions for this should follow the same permissions as the rest of the group code coverage feature.\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* The GraphQL API documentation will need to be updated\n* The [feature documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/repositories_analytics/index.html) will need to be updated\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n#### Measures of success\nWe expect that this view will increase views of the page by 50% month over month the first full month after this is released on gitlab.com and to SM customers as measured on the [Testing Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/633395/Testing-Category-Metrics?widget=9800498\u0026udv=992321).\n\n#### Acceptance criteria\n* When there is 1 or more project in a group with 1 or more coverage job that has a value, the most recent total project and job count and average coverage value (sum of job coverages / number of jobs) which is a better value than just the project average we think.\n* Feature documentation is updated\n\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-08T16:26:47.962Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T21:45:44.390Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T15:12:13.729Z","closed_by":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","GitLab Premium","GraphQL","Stretch","backend","devops::verify","documentation","frontend","group::pipeline insights","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263478","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263478","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263478/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263478/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#263478","relative":"#263478","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#263478"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2838,"epic":{"id":28788,"iid":2838,"title":"Code Coverage Data for groups","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2838","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":72402191,"iid":263467,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Clean up Snippet controllers\"","description":"\n\nThe following discussion from !44718 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @fjsanpedro started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44718#note_426249389):  (+3 comments)\n\n    \u003e Do you remember when this format was used?

are important discrepancies in the codebase of the 3 Gemnasium analyzer projects. These discrepancies need to be removed so that these 3 projects can be eventually share the same codebase, and be merged into a single one.\n\n## Further details\n\n- `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` depends on [common/command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.10.2/command), but `gemnasium` doesn't.\n- `gemnasium` uses [`Scanner.ScanDir`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.21.0/scanner/scanner.go#L104) but `gemnasium-python` uses [`ScanReader`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.21.0/scanner/scanner.go#L152) and `gemnasium-maven` uses [`ScanFile`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.21.0/scanner/scanner.go#L140).\n- As a consequence, `gemnasium` is the only project that uses [scanner/finder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.21.0/scanner/finder/finder.go) package, and other projects rely on custom detection logic.\n- `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` both run CLI commands to generate file that can be parsed, whereas `gemnasium` directly parses supported files.\n- `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` look for supported files in a specific order, whereas `gemnasium` doesn't. In the case of `gemnasium-python`, default pip files win over setuptools files, and `PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE` wins over everything else.\n- `gemnasium` scans all the supported files whereas `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` stops after the first match. `gemnasium-maven` could technically process multiple files but this would be a behavior change. `gemnasium-python` couldn't because of other limitations - scanned project would leak its dependencies to the next ones.\n\nLinks\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.21.0/main.go\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/v2.15.0/analyze.go\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/v2.18.4/analyze.go\n\n## Proposal\n\n- add structs that represent the package managers as well as the files they handle\n- implement a generic detection logic that leverages these structs and return supported projects; it can be configured to maintain the behavior of `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python`\n- introduce \"builders\" as an abstraction for commands executed to export the dependencies to a file Gemnasium can parse (execution of the Gemnasium Maven plugin, pipenv graph, etc.)\n- align all CLIs so that they use the same detection logic, build the projects that need to be built (where applicable), and scan them \n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eSee initial proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nShare as much code as possible, and let `gemnasium-python` and `gemnasium-maven` implement specific plugins:\n- `builder` plugins, to build the project and generate files that can be parsed\n- `parser` plugins, to parse the lock file or dependency graph, and extract a list of packages\n- `vrange ` plugins, to check if a version is included in a range\n\nEach plugin system is implemented in the main `gemnasium` project, and this is where the plugin registry lives.\n\nEach plugin lives with the project where its used:\n- new `builder` plugins are introduced in `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python`\n- some existing `vrange` plugins are moved\n- some existing `scanner/parser` plugins are moved\n\nFor instance, `vrange/python` moves to `gemnasium-python`, and `scanner/parser/mvnplugin` moves to `gemnasium-maven`.\n\nThe `gemnasium` project still builds the `gemnasium` Docker image, but it uses the same API as `gemnasium-python` and `gemnasium-maven`, for consistency. In the long term, shared code could be extracted into a separate repository.\n\nThe `scanner` package becomes generic, and only has two exported methods:\n- to walk a directory, and build a list of files to be processed\n- to process that list of files, using compatible builders and parsers\n\nThe walk function walks the given directory, and finds no more than one file per package type per directory. It queries the registered builders and parsers to figure out what files are supported. Parsers are queried first, so that ready-to-parse lock files win over dependency files (which require some kind of build).\n\nThe walk function is configurable, and it can optionally stop right after the first match. This way `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` can behave like they currently do.\n\nThe process function replaces `ScanDir`, `ScanFile`, and `ScanReader`, which are no longer needed.\n\nIdeally, the `main.go` of a Gemnasium project is simple as:\n1. importing builder, parser, and vrange plugins as anonymous\n1. creating a `NewApp` using the `gemnasium/cli` package, and running this app\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- introduce \"builders\" as an abstraction layers for the CLI tools executed to get a parseable dependency list\n  -

email in bio field can look like it is a verified email","description":"**[HackerOne report #996526](https://hackerone.com/reports/996526)** by `xenx` on 2020-10-02, assigned to @ngeorge1:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary  \n\nIn gitlab , an unverified email id of an account can't be displayed publicly through `Public email`  option it just gives an error like `public email is not an email you own` which is definitely understandable (since a unverified user can get into a private project by impersonating)\n\n![1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ef3a7993-c653-4f8b-9db6-70a5967f2e43/1.png)\n\nCase1: For a verified user, the public profile look like this when `public email is enabled` \n \n![2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/dde44e20-38da-4ec5-9bd2-c5e76cb09673/2.png)\n\nCase2: But the `Public email` option  for a unverified email can be bypassed to show the email publicly using the `bio`. Updating the bio with the unverified email look like this  \n\n![3.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ec4dd92e-2177-405e-864d-9750deb8dd0b/3.png)\n\nSo by using this an attacker can bypass the `public profile option` for a unverified email id(See both case1 and case2 is same) and get into a private project by impersonating through invitation or by requesting access.  \n\n![4.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/648ea61e-b5be-43b6-83c9-26ef0020b487/4.png).\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1) Create an account but don\u0026#39;t verify it.  \n2)Go to https://gitlab.com/profile and try to make the email display as public  \n3) You will see ```public email is not an email you own```  \n4) Now the update the bio with the email . You will see the profile looks just same to same like a verified email with ```mailto:```.\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nActually when bio is updated ```mailto:``` is added to email link ,hence it acts just like a publicly displayed verified email\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIn bio , ```mailto:``` should not included. Also it would be better if unverified email can\u0026#39;t be searchable through project member invitation.\n\n#####  PS\n\nI added the account with ==[@]gitlab.com==  just to show how a malicious user can use ```[@]domain.com``` to impersonate to get into a target private project.\n\n####  Impact\n\nA malicious user can bypass the inability to display the unverified email publicly through `public email option` and improve the odds of a social engineering attack/infiltration being successful.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ef3a7993-c653-4f8b-9db6-70a5967f2e43/1.png)\n* [2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/dde44e20-38da-4ec5-9bd2-c5e76cb09673/2.png)\n* [3.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ec4dd92e-2177-405e-864d-9750deb8dd0b/3.png)\n* [4.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/648ea61e-b5be-43b6-83c9-26ef0020b487/4.png)\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently the \"bio\" field allows users to enter emails in multiple ways that look like \"verified\" emails when displayed.\n\n### Proposals considered\n\n- [Prohibit email addresses in the bio field](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263411#note_652346121).  Problematic because a migration is required and it will partially delete user input data, neither of which we want to do.  Would only impact approximately 0.05% of SaaS Users, based on a sample of 100K users.\n- [Add a \"Bio\" prefix when displaying](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263411#note_655484249).  [Problematic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68628#note_660870952) because the user can enter a line break then \"Verified email: [EMAIL]\".\n- [Display raw `bio_html`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68628#note_660870952) (using `html_escape`). Problematic because this \"breaks\" the display of any bios that include HTML or Markdown.\n\n### Proposal\n\nTBD\n\n### Related links\n\n- Markdown parsing for `bio` was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35604","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-08T07:50:20.059Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T12:51:56.725Z","closed_at":"2021-09-13T09:07:25.040Z","closed_by":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Category:User Management","Epic 6340","FY22::Q3","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-840","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::4","section::dev","security","severity::4","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-01-06","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263411","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263411","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263411/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263411/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#263411","relative":"#263411","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#263411"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72368594,"iid":263410,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Track unique wiki page views in Usage Ping\"","description":"The following discussion from !44622 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @toupeira started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44622#note_425550492):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **question:** I had to add `.to_s` because the constants in `TrackUniqueEvents` are defined as symbols, but the values in `known_events.yml` are strings and we do a strict comparison at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/b30b770b3e5c6219ac2ccfbeae2fa5ab5b3b1f3a/lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/hll_redis_counter.rb#L144.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e But I saw we also have a few `.to_s` calls at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/b30b770b3e5c6219ac2ccfbeae2fa5ab5b3b1f3a/lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/track_unique_events.rb#L41-47, so maybe we should remove those and change the constants to be strings?

[ ] Add this issue to the stage group epic for the corresponding quarter's UX scorecards. Verify that the \"UX scorecard\" label is applied.\n1. [ ] After working with your PM to identify a top job, write it using the Job to Be Done (JTBD) format: When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]. Review with your manager to ensure your JTBD is written at the appropriate level. Remember, a JTBD is not a user story and should not lead directly to a solution.\n1. [ ] Make note of which [personas](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/) might be performing the job, and link to them from this issue's description. Keeping personas in mind allows us to make the best decisions to address specific problems and pain points. Note: Do not include a persona in your JTBD format, as multiple types of users may complete the same job.\n1. [ ] If your JTBD spans more than one stage group, that’s great! Review your JTBD with a designer from that stage group for accuracy.\n1. [ ] Review the current experience, noting where you expect a user's high and low points to be. Capture the screens and jot down observations.\n   - If you're re-scoring the experience, recapture the entire flow. You will likely have some of the artifacts (i.e. a UI screen that wasn't changed) that you can simply reuse.\n1. [ ] Have internal or external users accomplish the JTBD. Record this session and document their experience. Note that 3-5 users are preferred, as this provides valuable insights and removes subjectivity. Make sure to avoid setting up a task-based usability study. The goal is to provide the participant context (the JTBD) and listen and watch how they attempt to complete the job. What we learn may differ from participant to participant. \n     - If it's not possible to have internal or external users go through the experience, a self-heurisitic evaluation can be done instead.\n1. [ ] Use the [**Grading Rubric**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-scorecards/#grading-rubric) to provide an overall measurement that becomes the **Benchmark score** for the experience (one grade per JTBD), and add it to this issue's description. Document the score in the [UX Scorecard Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iw5oj12QdLHOADV8P6ICE3P1U32eKMstpkIR4sPJRTo/edit#gid=0).\n1. [ ] Once testing is complete, create a walkthrough video that documents what you experienced/witnessed within the existing experience. Begin the video with a contextual introduction including: your role, stage group, specifiy how you acquired the data (ex: internal or external users, or self-heurisitic evaluation), and a short introduction to your JTBD and purpose of the UX scorecard. This is not a \"how to\" video, but instead should help build empathy for users by clearly showing areas of potential frustration and confusion. (You can point out where the experience is positive, too.) At the end of the video, make sure to include narration of the Benchmark Score. Examples [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCnpEGhS8uk\u0026feature=youtu.be) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkTOwTxsoL8).\n   - If you're re-scoring the experience, walkthrough the entire flow again. For narration, you can highlight the recent improvements but still call out any areas that could still use some tweaking (in the next round of iterations, if applicable). The re-score video, in theory, should be shorter since we've hopefully eliminated a few bumps in the user flow.\n1. [ ] Post your video to the [GitLab Unfiltered YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) channel, and link to it from this issue's description.\n1. [ ] Link to your video in the [Engineering Week in Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkfzI85aqw8chYDBf2GLRvjKEa3s0FWHMI3u0DIr-xg/edit).\n1. [ ] [Create a recommendation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/new?issuable_template=UX%20Scorecard%20Part%202) for this JTBD and add it to the same stage group epic as this issue. Also add a link to your recommendation issue to this issue.\n1. [ ] Following the [UX Scorecards setup instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-scorecards/#setup), create an issue (and epic, if needed) to rescore the same JTBD the following quarter to see if we have made improvements. We will use the grades to monitor progress toward improving the overall quality of our user experience. Add that issue as related to this issue.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-07T20:26:21.984Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:41:38.674Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T15:41:38.635Z","closed_by":{"id":3721950,"username":"vkarnes","name":"Valerie Karnes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3721950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vkarnes"},"labels":["DEPRECATED_group import","DEPRECATED_import","DEPRECATED_project import","Next Up","UX","UX scorecard","devops::manage","group::import","section::dev","workflow::validation backlog"],"milestone":{"id":1212252,"iid":48,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 1-3 releases","description":"Issues which are not quite ready to schedule, but should be considered as part of the near-term roadmap.","state":"active","created_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48"},"assignees":[{"id":5213400,"username":"amandakhughes","name":"Amanda Hughes","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5213400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandakhughes"}],"author":{"id":5213400,"username":"amandakhughes","name":"Amanda Hughes","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5213400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandakhughes"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5213400,"username":"amandakhughes","name":"Amanda Hughes","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5213400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandakhughes"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263363","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":12,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 12 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263363","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263363/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263363/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#263363","relative":"#263363","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#263363"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4557,"epic":{"id":122609,"iid":4557,"title":"Import UX Future Vision","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4557","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72348432,"iid":263359,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add translation for assignee tooltip in MR list","description":"In alignment with `reviewers`, let's also add translations for the tooltip in `assignee`\n\n`app/views/shared/issuable/_assignees.html.haml`\n\n![image](/uploads/a537601d929f479438f2f55dd8401008/image.png)\n\nFor consistency, you can copy what was done in `reviewers` \u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43565/diffs?commit_id=4a9a0402e054e446a7d9f83b9babcb018b71468a","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-07T20:09:23.452Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T12:08:10.934Z","closed_at":"2022-06-23T12:08:10.910Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","maintenance::refactor","missed:13.5","section::dev","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

`project_finder_similarity_sort` feature flag.\n\nThis feature will use the similarity sort to find projects on the instance security dashboard.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Threat Insights\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_secure_threat_insights`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @jschafer\n- PM: @matt_wilson \n\n## Stakeholders\n\nN/A\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com\n\n## Testing Groups/Projects/Users\n\nI've done testing against my own user. This feature cannot be tested against groups or projects as it's a user level feature.\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen searching for projects on the global Security Dashboard, the projects should be sorted by similarity.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe main thing that can go wrong here is the database query takes too long and has a negative impact on the application performance. The feature flag be should be turned off. No MR rollback should be necessary.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nThe [Slow Queries Count](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/RZmbBr7mk/gitlab-triage?orgId=1\u0026refresh=30s\u0026from=1623682656316\u0026to=1623704256316\u0026var-env=gprd\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-prometheus=prometheus-01-inf-gprd\u0026var-prometheus_app=prometheus-app-01-inf-gprd\u0026var-backend=All\u0026var-type=All\u0026var-stage=main\u0026viewPanel=1352) would be the most useful dashboard to monitor.\n\nAdditionally, we can track using [production logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/visualize#/edit/b8c7a470-c945-11eb-8449-0b44d31e2557?_g=h@d01ba18\u0026_a=h@48f7341) to see how the search timings are looking.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 7085ed1cf60a1dc3a06d6c2fb76290cd3fb19720`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set project_finder_similarity_sort true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set project_finder_similarity_sort true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 7085ed1cf60a1dc3a06d6c2fb76290cd3fb19720`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](#235676) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e project_finder_similarity_sort true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - This feature will be rolled out using a time percentage due to the low usage of this feature (\u003c600 calls/week\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set project_finder_similarity_sort \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](#235676) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `project_finder_similarity_sort` feature flag.

(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/11554)\n\nI understand we need to set headers to prevent caching, when on a branch, but this is unnecessary when using strong ETags.\n\nRight now we specify\n```\ncache-control: public, no-cache, no-store\netag: W/\"5b1faf106e7b6186e336e76fb741f969\"\nexpires: Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT\npragma: no-cache\nvary: Accept-Encoding\n```\n\nWe need to consider 2 cases. 1 being regular public files, and the other being private projects.\n\nWe can create a strong ETag, by combining the sha of the branch/tag/ref, the filename (or a hash thereof) and the value of the `content-encoding` header if presend. For example a Link like this `https://gitlab.com/T4cC0re/freebsd-ci/-/raw/master/installer/init.sh` should produce these headers:\n\n```\netag: \"2b02fde12e155eb65409bbf1b4c9a5b305082e85-installer_init.sh\"\ncache-control: public, must-revalidate, max-age=0\npragma: no-cache\nvary: Accept-Encoding\n```\nOr in case of a request with `accept-encoding: gzip`, that was responded to with `content-encoding: gzip`\n```\netag: \"2b02fde12e155eb65409bbf1b4c9a5b305082e85-installer_init.sh-gzip\"\n```\n\nThe `expires` header is rendered irrelevant by `max-age=0` and `must-revalidate` (but can be kept, if desired). `no-cache` and `no-store` prevent caches from caching. But this is not what we want. We want everyone in the cache chain to revalidate using the ETag. Thus `must-revalidate` replaces them.  \n`pragma: no-cache` is deprecated, but still used by HTTP/1.0. The value specified here is only used in HTTP/1.1+ when `cache-control` is not set.\n\nFor a private resource we just need to change the headers a tiny bit:\n\n```\netag: \"2b02fde12e155eb65409bbf1b4c9a5b305082e85-installer_init.sh\"\ncache-control: private, must-revalidate, max-age=0\npragma: no-cache\nvary: Accept-Encoding\n```\n\nChanging the `cache-control` to `private` will ensure caches along the way do not cache the response, but the browser cache may. It will need to revalidate before using the resource. This means bypassing caches along the way and revalidating directly at the origin.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-07T14:09:16.971Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T12:01:16.087Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T10:49:14.812Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","backend","corrective action","devops::create","group::source code","maintenance::performance","missed-deliverable","missed:15.3","priority::2","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","security","severity::2","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"}],"author":{"id":555989,"username":"T4cC0re","name":"Hendrik Meyer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/555989/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/T4cC0re"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263246","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263246","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263246/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263246/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#263246","relative":"#263246","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#263246"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72321424,"iid":263240,"project_id":278964,"title":"Sync existing branch and commit data when a namespace is added to Jira Connect App","description":"When a GitLab namespace is added to the app config page in Jira, we are only planning to sync merge request data.

the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen defining `needs` for a delayed job, job is scheduled to be run even if a job fails (or cancelled manually)\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFollowing sample .gitlab-ci.yml can be used to reproduce this beahvior\n\n```yaml\nimage: alpine:latest\n\nstages:\n    - first\n    - second\n    - third\n\nslow job:\n  stage: first\n  script:\n    - exit 1\n\nautomatic job 1:\n  stage: second\n  script:\n    - echo \"Automatic Job 1\"\n\nautomatic job 2:\n  stage: second\n  script:\n    - echo \"Automatic Job 2\"\n  needs: [\"slow job\"]\n\ndeploy job:\n  stage: third\n  when: delayed\n  start_in: 2 minutes\n  script:\n    - echo \"Deploy job\"\n  needs: [\"slow job\", \"automatic job 1\"]\n```\n(see screenshot below for actual results)\n\n### Example Project\n\nAn example available at: https://gitlab.com/dzalbo/sandbox-ci/-/tree/scheduled-jobs-bug\n\nA sample CI pipeline: https://gitlab.com/dzalbo/sandbox-ci/-/pipelines/199172420\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDelayed jobs are scheduled and run even if jobs in the `needs` section failed or were cancelled\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nJobs should not be scheduled / started\n\n### Relevant logs and/or

In this release accessing the linter is easier than ever, as it is apart of the new pipeline editor, with this improvement you can easy access CI linter and quickly validate and see the details of each job before running your pipeline.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nFrom part 3 outlined in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4540#note_424441378.\n\n* port the linting functionality from the CI Lint page\n\n### Proposal \n\n#### \"CI Lint\" button on the Pipeline Editor page\n\nThe most MVC option would be to just have a button for \"CI Lint\" on the Pipeline Editor page, and then place a \"Pipeline Editor\" button to the CI Lint page so it's easy to go back.\n\n#### Place CI Lint in a tab inside the editor\n\nI think having both Validate and CI Lint tabs would be redundant, if we go this route we should at least merge the two. The Validate tab is basically the Linter without the editor (just the warnings). :thinking:\n\nHowever, in that case, why don't we just have the Linter in the editor tab itself? I'm guessing it's more effort to implement?\n\n@v_mishra had a great suggestion:\n\n\u003e How about presenting `Validate` as a button on the same header as the CI template dropdown (right hand side corner). Clicking on it could provide in-line suggestions if any or just a toast/alert if validated successfully, and it would become inactive until I make any changes to config.\n\nIt'd look something like this:\n|  |\n|--|\n| ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/f37b3ef4ebcd408871aba64fd7031103/image.png) |\n\nThen, we could work on offering those suggestions in-line (perhaps once we work on the problem validation for CI validation).\n\n### Links\n[Actionable: Prioritization](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/4a4421a9-9fb4-4e16-acab-9ba9042e741d/insights/present/ab963e60-b571-4272-aeac-1b8b2d3e192b)\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-07T10:39:07.959Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:41:26.272Z","closed_at":"2021-01-12T08:59:47.675Z","closed_by":{"id":1607849,"username":"mrincon","name":"Miguel Rincon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1607849/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mrincon"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Pipeline Authoring","Deliverable","closed::complete","devops::verify","direction","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":1607849,"username":"mrincon","name":"Miguel Rincon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1607849/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mrincon"}],"author":{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1607849,"username":"mrincon","name":"Miguel Rincon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1607849/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mrincon"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263147","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263147","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263147/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/263147/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#263147","relative":"#263147","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#263147"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4540,"epic":{"id":121543,"iid":4540,"title":"Pipeline Editor -

This default policy will get picked up by the worker although the project doesn't have any container repository.\n\n## Improvements\n\n* In `ContainerExpirationPolicyWorker`, select policies that are:\n  * runnable\n  * are linked to a project with container repositories\n* Implement the above by introducing a scope (perhaps, `ContainerRepository.executable`) at the model level\n* By having a more precise selection of the policies, we don't spend worker computation time on policies that will result in a no op during their execution.\n\n## Risks\n\n* The cleanup policies are going through a [heavy change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40740) to implement limits.
