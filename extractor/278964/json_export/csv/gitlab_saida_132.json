Then we can include or inherit that concern in the project and snippet service.\n\nWe need to ensure that this new service for snippets can move the repository to a different repository storage and that the move is reflected properly by calling at `track_repository_storage` and, therefore present in the `SnippetRepository` table.\n\nWe could also just call it `Repositories::UpdateREpositoryStorageService` and make it the default service while, in this case, `Projects:UpdateRepositoryStorageService` will be an extension and just an exception that we need to make for projects because they can hold different repositories.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-25T08:56:57.847Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T07:06:24.513Z","closed_at":"2020-12-18T06:43:54.461Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218990","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218990","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218990/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218990/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218990","relative":"#218990","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218990"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3393,"epic":{"id":58470,"iid":3393,"title":"Update snippet REST API endpoints to allow moving repository storage","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3393","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 29, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34966001,"iid":218987,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Step 3] Extract and refactor repository move logic from the Project model into the HasRepository concern","description":"At the moment, all the logic to move repository storages from one place to another is located inside the `Project` model. We need to extract and move them into the `HasRepository` concern in order to make them available also for snippets and, in the future, for wikis.\n\nSome of the methods I've seen are the following (but there can be more methods involved):\n\n- [`change_repository_storage`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L2074)\n- [`set_repository_writable!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L2068)\n- [`set_repository_read_only!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L2059)\n- [`git_transfer_in_progress?`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L2232). Instead of moving this method, we can add it to the concern and return `raise NotImplementedError`, and let any classes that include concern to implement it. The implementation would be just the line `repo_reference_count \u003e 0` (this will make sense once we add/move the rest of the methods.\n- [`reference_counter`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L2242). \n\nWe need also to create the methods:\n\n- `repo_reference_count`. The implementation will be just: `reference_counter(type: Gitlab::GlRepository::SNIPPET).value`\n\nWe need to follow the logic in order to ensure we have the same method logic in projects and snippets after moving them to the concern, having in mind that we might need to readapt the functionality in the future for group wikis.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218992, we added the relation `repository_storage_moves` to the snippet model. We need to move this relation to the `HasRepository` concern as well. Nevertheless, we need to update the `class:` attribute accordingly to the class that includes the concern. I think we can make a class method the `HasRepository` concern, that then project and snippet can implement and return the proper value.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-25T08:31:17.655Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T12:03:37.122Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T08:35:55.916Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218987","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218987","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218987/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218987/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218987","relative":"#218987","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218987"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3393,"epic":{"id":58470,"iid":3393,"title":"Update snippet REST API endpoints to allow moving repository storage","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3393","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 29, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34965395,"iid":218986,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Step 1] Move `change_repository_storage` policy to the BasePolicy","description":"The only policy that we look to ensure that the user can move to a different storage is [`change_repository_storage`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/policies/project_policy.rb#L539).

Open the Chrome Developer Tools and goto the **Network** tab. Ensure that the **Disable cache** checkbox is not selected.\n1. Expand the first downstream pipeline and observe that the XHR request is a `200`.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nFollowing comment https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2351#note_263237910\n\nI think just having gitlab-ci.yml template added for AWS (deploy to EC2, ECS, Fargate) would suffice in the short term. We can even use the tool we suggest in our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/deployment/).\n\nI feel that most customers would like to understand our best practices and documentation around how to best deploy using our product and what's needed to be successful. Adding into AutoDevops functionality would be most awesome, but that may be a different issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nUse the  `gitlab-ci.yml` template for deploying to AWS Fargate.\n\nWe will enforce the presence of `--requires-compatibilities` argument from the launch type - this will only be passed in case Fargate is selected. If ECS is selected as the launch type this is ignored.\n\nSteps needed in the template:\n\n1. Add a new [Launch_type](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215136) called Fargate\n1. Update an ECS service. (using GitLab's ECS image)\n1. Use the our docker image of deploy_ECS to create a new revision for ECS task definition b and update an ECS service. (using GitLab's AWS CLI image)\n1. Verify the deployment of an ECS revision.\n1. Start the run of an ECS task on Fargate.\n\n\nActions needed to be done\n\n* [x] Add a new [Launch_type](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215136) called Fargate\n* [x] Update the `deploy_ecs.yml` template and/or deploy_ecs docker image\n* [ ] Create documentation on how to use the template/autoDevOps \n* [ ] Add to documentation that Launch type ECS is actually targeting ECS-\u003eEC2\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

forced to `false` so that the `master` branch checks SAST in DinD mode.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218554 for similar issue affecting Dependency Scanning.\n\n### Steps to

The `secrets:` are different than `variables:`\n1. The `secrets:` clearly indicate a purpose: We want a secret to be used!\n2. The `variables:` can be used by variable expansion and are by definition \"known\"\n3. The `secrets:` can be only used during the execution of the CI job by the Runner\n4. We have many credential providers that can be used by `secrets:`\n5. The CI job if it wants to use any secret needs to request it explicitly, only requested\n   are exposed\n6. Secrets create a clear split between `variables:` and `secrets:` on their purpose\n7. Secrets access should be auditable by know: who, when and for what\n8. All secrets are masked, always\n\n### Vault integration\n\n1. Vault is one of the secret providers\n1. We want Vault to be easy to be use in default case, but allow flexibility for our customers that have different approach\n1. We want Vault auth in general to be configured via UI, but not for the first iteration!\n1. Today, we consider Vault to be configured using CI Variables: `VAULT_URL`, `VAULT_AUTH_...`. This allows us to have a single vault per job, but many different vaults used by different jobs, as these `VAULT_*` variables can be defined for a specific environment scope or in context of a specific job\n1. We offer a simple opinionated syntax, we use by default `kv2` engine\n1. We convert a simple syntax (a string) into a complex hash having all details explicitly stated.\nThis is how we process secrets internally, but we expose an easy to start usage of Vault.\n1. We allow users to fine-configure all details if the simple syntax is not enough for them\n\nVault is configured by adding to CI Variables (can be via CI/CD Settings, or part of YAML):\n\n- `VAULT_URL`: this is required\n- `VAULT_AUTH_*` (username, password, role): this is optional\n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  # production/s3 is a `path:`, where `secret-key` is a fieldname\n  # @path/to/engine indicates a path used by `kv-v2` which we consider to be a default engine\n  VAULT_SIMPLE_SECRET:\n    vault: production/s3/secret-key\n    file: true/false # optional, with default: false\n                     # false: VAULT_SIMPLE_SECRET would hold a masked value\n                     # true: VAULT_SIMPLE_SECRET would hold a path to ephemeral file holding a secret\n\n  VAULT_SIMPLE2_SECRET:\n    vault: production/s3/secret-key@path/to/engine\n\n  VAULT_COMPLEX_SECRET:\n    vault:\n      engine:\n        name: kv-v2\n        path: path/to/engine\n      path: production/s3\n      field: secret-key\n```\n\n### Rethinking the purpose of CI/CD Variables (mid-term future?)\n\n1. CI/CD Variables are multipurpose and confusing as they are a \"known values\", like `MY_URL` and \"secrets\", like `AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY`\n1. All variables are always exposed to each CI job which has a security consequences, as it increases a chance of exposing secret when it does not need it\n1. GitLab can be another secret provider (aka. `internal`), similar to other secret providers that we implement\n1. _GitLab does offer an internal Secret Provider_\n1. One of the ideas behind internal secret provider is to mark some Variables as of type `Secret`\n1. Another idea is to split the current variables into being `Variables` and `Secrets`\n1. Secret as described earlier needs to be written explicitly in CI job as required to be used\n\nWe would \n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  MY_INTERNAL_SECRET:\n    gitlab:\n    file: true/false # optional, with default: false\n                     # false: MY_INTERNAL_SECRET would hold a masked value\n                     # true: MY_INTERNAL_SECRET would hold a path to ephemeral file holding a secret\n```\n\n### Other credentials storage (future)\n\nAny other credential storage takes a path of `vault:` following the same design pattern, like:\n\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  MY_CREDHUB_SECRET:\n    credhub: path/to/secret\n```\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### Links / references\n\n- https://concourse-ci.org/vault-credential-manager.html\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31831","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-22T08:49:02.774Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T21:28:24.908Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T05:43:41.245Z","closed_by":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"labels":["Category:Secrets Management","Deliverable","Release::P1","cicd::active","devops::release","feature::addition","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"}],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3170776,"username":"krasio","name":"Krasimir Angelov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3170776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/krasio"},"user_notes_count":122,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218746","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218746","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218746/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218746/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218746","relative":"#218746","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218746"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2875,"epic":{"id":30992,"iid":2875,"title":"Fetch \u0026 Configure Secrets","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2875","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34868082,"iid":218725,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use JUnit summary results endpoint to load badge counter and Test summary tab","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

In the case of the `gitlab` project and other large projects this can consist of many (20+) JUnit XML files that need to be parsed, converted into structs, and returned to the FE in order to load the test tab. Currently the test tab for the `gitlab` project takes ~25s to load.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve?

For IPv6 we would have to do a partial match, which may reduce security. This also doesn't fix the problem for cases like VPNs or other scenarios where the IP address changes for each session. \n\nIf either the cookie exist or the IP addresses match, an unknown sign in email will not be sent. This still may not solve the problem for all users. A commenter noted that Tor users may not accept cookies so it may not help those users. \n\n## Original description \n\n### Summary\n\nIt seems that since the move to CloudFlare, we are getting an increase in customer contact regarding [`Unknown Sign-In` emails](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/unknown_sign_in_notification.html). Based on our documentation, we should be comparing the IP address of the last sign-in with the latest sign-in and then sending an email if they don't match. \n\nHowever, IPv6 addresses appear to be matching differently. The last 4 blocks in an IPv6 address change more frequently, and we appear to be doing some sort of regex matching that is causing more frequent `Unknown Sign-In` emails.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nNot all users are able to reproduce. You can try to log out and sign-in repetitively and take note if you receive an email. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nAn unknown sign-in email is sent every time you are logging in from the same location.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nAn unknown sign-in email should only be sent when there is a clear mismatch of IP addresses.\n### Output of checks\n\nThis happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Zendesk Tickets (Internal)\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/157940\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/157594\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nWe would need to update existing unit tests to account for the following cases:\n\nSend email when:\n- Device is known and ip address is not known.\n- Device is not know and ip address is known.\n- Device and ip address is not known.\n- Device is known and ip address is know but the cookie holding the device information has past expiration date. \n\nDo not send email when:\n- Device is known and ip address is known.\n\nUnit tests would suffice for covering the above cases.

For `GitAccess`, it can be `Project`, `Snippet`, `Wiki`, the holder of a repository.\n\nThis has lead to buggy code, could we name/rename the usage to make it consistent?\n\n## Improvements\n\nI am

certificate error with ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE on alpine containers","description":"### Summary\n\nCertain Dependency Scanning analyzers fail when supplied with a `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL` with a self-signed certificate error. This is related to the system certificate store which `git` uses on alpine (potentially other tools too).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nNeed a self signed git repo. In this case we use: https://gitlab-airgap-test.us-west1-b.c.group-secure-a89fe7.internal/analyzers/gemasium-db\n\n1. echo -n | openssl s_client -connect gitlab-airgap-test.us-west1-b.c.group-secure-a89fe7.internal:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' \u003e test.crt\n1. docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/ash -v $PWD:/tmp/foo alpine:latest \n1. apk add git\n1. cp /tmp/foo/test.crt /etc/ssl/certs # what common/cacert does\n1. git clone https://gitlab-airgap-test.us-west1-b.c.group-secure-a89fe7.internal/analyzers/gemnasium-db \n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/go-modules/pipelines/148212925\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nRunning analyzer with `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL` pointing to repo with self signed cert causes a \"SSL certificate problem\" error. And the scan fails.\n\nCurrent workaround: \n- add `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true` to `.gitlab-ci.yml` variables section\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNo error should occur. The scan should succeed.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nSwitch `common/cacert` from [writing cert bundle to /etc/ssl/certs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/master/cacert/bundle.go#L33) to instead use `update-ca-certificates`. Unfortunately this requires a system command.\n\nThis sequence works:\n1. echo -n | openssl s_client -connect gitlab-airgap-test.us-west1-b.c.group-secure-a89fe7.internal:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' \u003e test.crt\n1. docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/ash -v $PWD:/tmp/foo alpine:latest \n1. apk add git\n1. cp /tmp/foo/test.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\n1. update-ca-certificates\n1. git clone https://gitlab-airgap-test.us-west1-b.c.group-secure-a89fe7.internal/analyzers/gemnasium-db\n\n### Proposal\n\n1.

For this, we need to add new `repository_storage` param (available only for admins) in both project and personal update REST endpoints.\n\nWe need to update also the `Snippets::UpdateService` to implement this action. Basically, taking a look at the [`Projects::UpdateService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/services/projects/update_service.rb) we need to make the following modifications:\n\n- We need to add the column `repository_read_only` into the snippets model. This column will be set once we start the move until we finish it.\n- Check if the `repository_storage` has changed by looking at the params in the service\n- Check if the user is allowed to change the `repository_storage`. Basically it would be a matter of adding `rule { admin }.enable :change_repository_storage` in the proper place. Nevertheless, we would need to add that to both project and personal snippets policies. In my opinion, the `admin` condition is not tight to projects, therefore, I think we can move it from the project policy into the [`BasePolicy`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/policies/base_policy.rb). That way we can reuse it in the future for group wikis.\n- Then we need to add a method like [`change_repository_storage`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L2085) into the `Snippet` model. I'm tempted to refactor this a little bit. We can move that method into the [`HasRepository` concern](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/concerns/has_repository.rb#L19).\n- In order to refactor the method into the concern, we need to add the relationship `repository_storage_moves` into snippets like the one project has. This relation uses the class [`ProjectRepositoryStorageMove`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project_repository_storage_move.rb). We might want to refactor that and create our own `SnippetRepositoryStorageMove`, with functionality shared between these two classes.\n- Another thing to consider is whether to reuse or not the existing `ProjectRepositoryStorageMove` table. In production, we only have 640 records, hence the table is not too big. We might want to rename it and extend it to reuse it with snippets, instead of having a completely new table just for snippets (This last option is easier to implement though).\n- Taking a look at [`ProjectUpdateRepositoryStorageWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/workers/project_update_repository_storage_worker.rb#L3) we can see the other services we might need.\n\nIn general, there is a lot of logic that can be shared by both projects and snippets. It's worth to take a closer look and design a strategy that can avoid duplicating code and functionality.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-21T05:54:52.969Z","updated_at":"2020-05-25T22:42:31.365Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T08:01:00.549Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","backend","devops::create","group::editor","repository","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This badge should appear at the end of the row of metadata (I believe this should be right after `due date`) and before `assignee(s)`.\n- When the content of the card needs to wrap, the behavior is the same as it currently is. The identifier and assignee avatars wrap to the last row.\n\n###### Style updates\n- Identifier text should be 14px instead of 12px\n- Revisit the line height and sizing of the icons with text (such as the weight icon and assigned weight) to make sure everything is aligned properly\n- All metadata and icons (identifier, weight, due dates that are NOT overdue, these icons, etc) should be $gray-700. These are currently a bit inconsistent. \n- Reduce `avatar` to small/16px.

Because of firewall protections, they are unable to do the import from the server directly, so they have instead installed an intermediary Bitbucket server. They then exported the repo(s) from the production Bitbucket server and imported them into the intermediary Bitbucket server. When done in this way, only the repo data is imported. No user metadata is imported.\n\nWhen attempting to import the repo from Bitbucket to GitLab we see the userid associated with activity in the Bitbucket repo, but when we attempt to get the email address of that user to map the user to GitLab we don't get any email address. This results in everything being assigned to the user doing the import, with a note of the original userid.\n\nThe customer is requesting that we have an option to map based on userid when doing the import to GitLab, rather than mapping by email address.\n\nWe have also encouraged them to look into what they can do to populate user metadata onto the Bitbucket server as an alternative \"fix\" for this problem.\n\n[Internal link to customer ZD ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/157298)\n\n### Default to OFF\n\nThis feature is hidden behind the feature flag `bitbucket_server_user_mapping_by_username`, since it is to be used only in exceptional cases, such as the one described above.

But short of that, I think https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html#nomenclature is leading us to `replicable_id`.\n\n@brodock had this idea in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.0.0-rc20200513160610-ee/ee/app/models/geo_node.rb#L178-184, and @vsizov did this in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v13.0.0-rc20200513160610-ee/ee/app/workers/geo/blob_verification_primary_worker.rb#L13\n\nThis looks like `replicable_name: \"package_file\", replicable_id: \"1234\"`. Which I think works, because a `replicable` is already a particular instance of a model.\n\nAside: Though this makes me feel like `replicable_name` is less than ideal. Maybe we should add a definition for ``Replicable name: A replicable name is an arbitrary key that is unique to each model that Geo knows how to replicate. For example the replicable name of `Packages::PackageFile` is `\"package_file\"`.`` Or does anyone have a better name for `replicable_name`?\n\n## Proposal\n\n- [ ] Rename `model_record` to `replicable`\n- [ ] Rename `model_record_id` to `replicable_id`\n- [ ] Add definition for `replicable_name` to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html#nomenclature?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-20T18:08:48.701Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T20:52:14.470Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T20:52:14.461Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::systems","group::geo","section::enablement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218584","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218584","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218584/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218584/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218584","relative":"#218584","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218584"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34817000,"iid":218582,"project_id":278964,"title":"Non-archive artifacts give a 404 when downloaded","description":"### Summary\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23847 adds a variety of artifacts to the download dropdown on the pipelines page. Previously, that dropdown only included `archive` artifacts.\n\nHowever, the download routes and controller assume that only one artifact per job will be downloadable, and when not given a file type it assumes that the artifact is of type `archive`. Currently, the frontend does not provide a file type, so whenever there is a request to download an artifact of a different type, the controller cannot find it and returns a 404.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Find a project that creates non-archive downloadable artifacts in its pipelines. Any security scan will work for this.\n2. Run a pipeline and make sure it is successful.\n3. In the pipelines page, click on \"download\" icon for the new pipeline.\n4. See that the non-archive artifact is listed in the download options.\n5. Open the browser's dev tools to the Network tab.\n6. Click on the non-archive artifact in the download dropdown.\n7. See that nothing is downloaded, and in the Network tab see that the request returns a 404.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/sethgitlab/dvwa-dast/pipelines\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAttempting to download a non-archive artifact gives a 404.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAttempting to download a non-archive artifact downloads the artifact.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Recording_2020-05-20_at_1.48.17_PM](/uploads/6590ac8baf7abb3212c8211ef57bad7b/Screen_Recording_2020-05-20_at_1.48.17_PM.mov)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe current download route takes a project and a build, and uses the build to find the artifact. To do so, it makes the assumption that only one artifact per job will be downloadable. This is no longer an accurate assumption, which is holding up additional feature work and makes this bug difficult to fix quickly.\n\nIt would be better to have routes that use an artifact's database ID to find it.

container registry frontend code to ease community contribution","description":"The container registry frontend code, due to being a proper SPA and not just a page served by Rails, it's a bit bigger and more complex than the rest.\r\n\r\nWith in mind the ability to facilitate community contributor to navigate and contribute on the code we should re-structure the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How \r\n### Component classification\r\n\r\n#### Smart components\r\n\r\nSmart components orchestrate multiple `dumb components` and connect to vuex/API they do not `directly` represent any UI, smart components are: \r\n\r\n- Pages\r\n- Complex components that encapsulate multiple components\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Dumb components\r\n\r\nThey represent the UI directly, they are not connected to the store/API in any way, all the input is taken in with props and all the output is done with events. These dumb components should represent a `single-piece` of the UI leveraging the single responsibility principle,  dumb components are:\r\n\r\n- buttons\r\n- list\r\n- pagination\r\n- modals\r\n- any `piece` of the UI\r\n\r\n### Folder structure\r\n\r\nDivide the `components` folder with sub-folder for each page\r\n\r\nTo avoid to have tons of constants and utility files jammed in the same file we should: \r\n\r\n- have a `folder` ie: constants\r\n- have an index.js in the folder that import any other file in the folder and exports them merged\r\n\r\nThis way we can have the constants classified per page or even more fine-grained structure if needed\r\n\r\n### Vuex store\r\n\r\nWe should divide the store in separate modules, one for each page, plus a root one containing the config (whatever we imported from the mounting dataset)\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- registry/\r\n-- explorer/\r\n--- pages/\r\n---- list.vue\r\n---- details.vue\r\n---- index.vue\r\n--- components/\r\n---- list_page/\r\n----- image_list.vue\r\n----- image_pagination.vue\r\n---- details_page/\r\n---- shared/\r\n--- constants/\r\n---- index.js\r\n---- list_page.js\r\n---- detail_page.js\r\n---- index_page.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\n- The code and functionality is now spread across different files, enabling an easier collaboration and removing or at least reducing merge conflicts\r\n- By adopting `dumb components` that are just props/events is much easier to write tests for them, and since most of the iteration is going to be done on UI pieces it will enable faster and safer iteration\r\n- It's easy to swap in and out dumb-components, allowing us to do some a/b testing if needed and/or quickly iterate and revert\r\n- By adhering to a stricter set of rules is much easier to grasp the intent of the code and review it","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-20T11:35:21.940Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T11:37:34.590Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T11:37:34.482Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","meta","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"}],"author":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218545","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218545","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218545/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218545/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218545","relative":"#218545","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218545"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34798563,"iid":218541,"project_id":278964,"title":"Legacy sast, dependency_scanning job triggered when rules are set","description":"### Summary\n\nIn projects where the CI config overrides the definition of `sast` and forces the `rules`, the legacy Docker-in-Docker orchestrator is triggered even though `SAST_DIND_DISABLED` is not set (default value is now `true`). The pipeline ends up having the legacy DinD orchestrator and the new scanning jobs running in parallel. Also, the `rules` are not applied to the new scanning jobs. Same goes with Dependency Scanning.\n\nWhen SAST and Dependency Scanning (DS) used to run in a single job, users could easily override the job definition of `sast` and `dependency_scanning`, and change the conditions on which the scanning jobs are triggered. With the removal of the Docker-in-Docker (DinD) orchestrator and [non-DinD becoming the default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37278), users now have to override multiple scanning jobs. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218444\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eBug information (click to expand)\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- create a project w/ a CI config that includes the SAST template\n- in the CI config, override the job definition of `sast` and disable the job using `rules`\n\nSame with the Dependency Scanning template and the `dependency_scanning` job.\n\nThis CI configuration used to work prior to [making no-DinD a default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37278).\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/pipelines/147562588\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/-/commit/cfdc090153c3a83497aff19de8b40d90c65ad38d\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThere's a legacy `sast` job (DinD orchestrator).\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThere should only be a `brakeman-sast` job, assuming the project is compatible with Brakeman (actually it's not, but this is [another issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218414)).\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee [pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/pipelines/147562588).\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nUpdate user documentation:\n\n1. Create a new section in the [Application Security page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4156030a594/doc/user/application_security/index.md) to document the steps needed when using a stage other than the default `test` stage\n1. Change the [`Getting error message sast job: stage parameter should be...` error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4156030a594/doc/user/application_security/index.md#L469-472) in the [main application security page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#getting-error-message-sast-job-stage-parameter-should-be-some-stage-name-here) to make it more generic so it applies to all the security jobs, and move it from being nested in the troubleshooting section to the new section created in `1.` above.\n1. \u003cdetails\u003e\n      \u003csummary\u003eClick for previous details\u003c/summary\u003e\n   \n      Add another sub-section to the [Troubleshooting section of the Application Security docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4156030a594/doc/user/application_security/index.md#L460) to explain that for `SAST` and `Dependency Scanning`, there are old jobs which remain for backwards compatibility reasons, and if the `sast` or `dependency_scanning` jobs are overridden with custom rules, then this will result in a legacy `sast` or `dependency_scanning `job being run, which will fail with the following text in the CI job log:\n   \n      ```\n      sast is used for configuration only, and its script should not be executed\n      ```\n      \n      We need to emphasize that these jobs must not run, so they can be used to configure a lot of things that apply to all \"real\" jobs, but not the rules property (as we need that one to stay with never value).\n   \n      We should also include that this behaviour will eventually be fixed by [Improve extendability of SAST, Dependency Scanning template rules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218444)\n   \u003c/details\u003e\n\n   This step is no longer necessary, since it's been addressed in [Explain new sast / dependency_scanning error that was introduced in 13.4\n](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47289).\n\n#### Issues with possible fix above\n\n~~[our linting makes the proposed documentation complex](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218541#note_469483426)~~\n\n~~Is there a way to modify the linting so this is a more simple fix if one follows our proposed documentation?~~\n\n/cc @nolith @theoretick

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Iteration 1: Migrate to Ingress-level traffic routing and create Canary Ingress resource on canary deplyoment\n\n* This iteration is basically to change the current routing mode for Canary Ingress and fixing existing features if it's broken.\n* BE updates auto-deploy-app (kubernetes charts) to always create Canary Ingress resource.\n  * Make sure that it doesn't break the existing workflow.\n  * Compute weight by the number of pods.\n  * Move onto Ingress-level traffic routing, and deprecate service-level traffic routing.\n  * There is an on-going effort here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/merge_requests/75/diffs\n* BE fixes deploy board to correctly show the status of pods.\n* Documentation\n\n```yaml\ncanary:\n  script:\n    # If canary deployment doesn't exist, it does\n    # - create a service for canary deployment\n    # - create a canary ingress and set a weight.\n    # - update production-service to route to production-deployment only.\n    # If canary deployment exists, it does legacy process.\n    - auto-deploy deploy canary\n\nproduction:\n  script:\n    - auto-deploy deploy\n    - auto-deploy delete canary\n```\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-20T08:44:27.575Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T08:25:43.380Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T16:28:54.529Z","closed_by":{"id":376774,"username":"nolith","name":"Alessio Caiazza","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/376774/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nolith"},"labels":["Category:Advanced Deployments","Deliverable","Release::P1","backstage [DEPRECATED]","cicd::active","devops::release","group::release","missed-deliverable","missed:13.2","missed:13.3","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218522","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218522","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218522/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218522/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218522","relative":"#218522","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218522"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3142,"epic":{"id":44626,"iid":3142,"title":"Update NGNIX Ingress Parameters annotations to Helm","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3142","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34790992,"iid":218516,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Step2|BE] Define snippet multi action specification","description":"Now that we almost have the new `snippet_files` param in the services and in GraphQL API, we need to define the info that array will have and check that once the services get it, they apply the proper changes.\n\nI propose to use the same definition we have for the web IDE. In the following image, we have what info we need to pass per each action:\n\n![image](/uploads/2c3588d692eac1e6ee112f1e55a704fb/image.png)\n\nWe need to ensure that `Snippets::CreateService` and `Snippets::UpdateService` can apply that definition to the repository properly.\n\nFor the `Snippets::CreateService` we need to ensure that we only accept `create` actions, because others don't make sense.\n\nWe need to update as well the validation in `SnippetInputAction` to match the necessary requirements according to the action.\n\nAfter checking with FE, the specification of the actions and the fields inside them, is like this:\n- `Create` action.

We need to add additional code to the method that sends the click usage [to Snowplow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/feature-instrumentation/#adding-events-to-snowplow). The click should only be recorded once per page load; if the user clicks on the Expand/Collapse button multiple times without refreshing the page, it should only be recorded as one click usage. Errors should also be handled silently and appropriately in case the telemetry server is inaccessible.\n\nThe telemetry server also needs to be set up to receive the click usage properly, which requires reading the documentation and figuring out what data needs to be sent to it. Because the `ReportSection` component is shared, we will also need to add a way to limit the telemetry to just the security report, possibly by having `ReportSection` emit an event that the parent component can hook into.\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* [ ] A click on the Expand/Collapse button will be properly recorded in the Snowplow telemetry.\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-19T23:36:55.417Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T03:19:48.612Z","closed_at":"2020-07-13T01:31:35.217Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Deliverable","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::secure","frontend","frontend-weight::5","group::threat insights","type::feature","workflow::staging"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"}],"author":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218487","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218487","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218487/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218487/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218487","relative":"#218487","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218487"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34778675,"iid":218485,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Vulnerability page styling","description":"## Objective\n\nPrior to the release of standalone vulnerabilities, work on the anticipated vulnerability detail pages was done by several different designers over the course of several months.

Solve\n\nWhen working on the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the Web IDE there is no feedback on whether or not the syntax of the file is correct or that the configuration written is valid.\n\n## Additional Details\n\nThe `.gitlab-ci.yml` file has nearly 30 [configuration parameters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#configuration-parameters). Some of these parameters only accept a specific input, and some of them can be more varied. Finally the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file needs to be [validated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#validate-the-gitlab-ciyml) to make sure it's following all the correct rules.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe should add the [`monaco-yaml`](https://github.com/pengx17/monaco-yaml) extension to allow our Web IDE to provide feedback for yaml files based on defined schemas.\n\nFor an initial MVC we should provide the `.gitlab-ci.yml` [schema](http://json.schemastore.org/gitlab-ci) from Schemastore.\n\n### Additional Implementation Note\n\nThis should be released with a feature flag - we may consider launching with the feature flag off in self-managed for a release.\n\n### What about...\n\n**...self-managed customers who don't want to/can't connect to an external resource?**\nThis is the MVC.

We recently changed the policy from being disabled by default to being enabled by default. The problem is, the record is created using the database defaults (there is nothing creating defaults on the model), and the only default value within the database is `cadence: 7d`, which is also not the desired default.\n\nWhat happened was when it was disabled by default, a user would go to the expiration policy settings, and the form would auto-populate with the default values:\n\n```\ncadence: '1d'\nkeep_n: 10\nolder_than: '90d'\n```\n\nThe user would enable the policy, and when saved/updated, the policy would now have the correct default values. So right now, all new projects are being created with an `enabled` container expiration policy that does not do anything when run because all of the settings are `NULL`. \n\nThe current bug means that many users may create projects, believe they have an expiration policy running with the defaults listed above and shown in their form, but it is actually empty and will never remove any tags.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a new project. Check the container expiration policy form, it is filled out, but the values are not actually correct until you hit save.\n\n### Example Project\n\nI created https://gitlab.com/sabrams/test123proj\n\nIf I check the expiration policy, it looks like it is enabled with the defaults:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-05-19_at_1.26.33_PM](/uploads/25bbf9a8163caa5e7405587534928642/Screen_Shot_2020-05-19_at_1.26.33_PM.png)\n\nIf I check the database, the policy is empty and has a cadence of '7d'\n\n```sql\n=\u003e select * from container_expiration_policies where project_id = 18875898;\n          created_at           |          updated_at           |          next_run_at          | project_id | name_regex | cadence | older_than | keep_n | enabled | name_regex_keep\n-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------+------------+---------+------------+--------+---------+-----------------\n 2020-05-19 15:07:34.156836+00 | 2020-05-19 15:07:34.156836+00 | 2020-05-26 15:07:34.149649+00 |   18875898 |            | 7d      |            |        | t       |\n(1 row)\n```\n\n### Proposed fix\n\n1. [x] Update the database to have the correct defaults:\n   ```\n   cadence: '1d'\n   keep_n: 10\n   older_than: '90d'\n   ```\n\n1. [ ] Remove the \"default\" values from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/helpers/container_expiration_policies_helper.rb so they do not appear when there is a `NULL` value.\n\n1. [ ] Create a background migration to disable all of the empty container expiration policies.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-19T19:34:51.307Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T06:36:38.273Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T06:36:38.245Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Package:P2","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","priority::3","ruby","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\nAs a security analyst, I need to be able to prevent certain activities from occurring (process starts, edits to files, etc.) so that I can ensure that my containers are fully protected from threats.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \nThe user will be able to follow GitLab documentation to install AppArmor and Pod Security Policies into their cluster.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n* The user will be able to follow GitLab documentation to install AppArmor and Pod Security Policies in their Kubernetes cluster and connect it to GitLab\n* After installation, the user will be able to do the following:\n  * Prevent new processes from starting inside a container\n  * Prevent changes from being made to specified files or paths inside a container\n  * Prevent new shells/terminals from starting in the container\n  * Prevent new ports from opening inside the container\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\nAdding AppArmor and Pod Security Policies is one step toward achieving our broader [Container Behavior Analytics strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/defend/container_behavior_analytics/) and is necessary to allow certain activities to be blocked inside containers.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\nThis aligns with the current GitLab permission model.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\nDocumentation will be added to inform a user how to install AppArmor and Pod Security Policies into their environment.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n* Unit tests will be built as appropriate\n* AppArmor and Pod Security Policies will be able to be installed together with Falco and Cilium and no product will interfere with the other one or cause undue performance problems\n* \\[as much as time allows\\] A long-running performance test will be done to verify that there are no memory leaks or other performance problems introduced over time\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n - [x] Add AppArmor loader as a gitlab hosted helm chart\n - [x] Allow users to add profiles (through AppArmor helm chart) into their k8s\n - [x] Allow users to use the existing profiles when deploying their apps (through auto-deploy-values).\n\n### Further improvements\n\nAs described in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218441#note_365264894), the integration between appArmor on a cluster level (in addition to PSP features) will be tracked by this [follow-up issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223816).\n\n[Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#policy-reference) covers a wider range of feature which are not exclusive to [AppArmor](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Policy_Layout). SELinux and SecComp could be further supported as follow-up issues.\n\nSELinux would expand the usage of *Mandatory Access Controls* to a wider number of distributions (the ones who do not support AppArmor).\n\nSecComp would allow a possible mapping of syscalls while paired with Falco. \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\\#216983","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-19T16:53:45.616Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:43:14.784Z","closed_at":"2020-06-24T17:25:52.818Z","closed_by":{"id":4906322,"username":"zmartins","name":"Zamir Martins","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zmartins"},"labels":["Category:Container Host Security","GitLab Core","Stretch","backend","backend-weight::5","devops::govern","direction","documentation","group::security policies","missed:13.1","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":4906322,"username":"zmartins","name":"Zamir Martins","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zmartins"},{"id":4946308,"username":"ngaskill","name":"Nick Gaskill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4946308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ngaskill"},{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"}],"author":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4906322,"username":"zmartins","name":"Zamir Martins","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zmartins"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218441","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218441","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218441/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218441/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218441","relative":"#218441","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218441"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3163,"epic":{"id":45250,"iid":3163,"title":"Container Host Security - Minimal to Viable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3163","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 22, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34757213,"iid":218440,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate the ideal way to cache","description":"There's a number of caching issues lately, and I would like to figure out an ideal way and unify our caching strategy. I'll fill the references and context over time.\n\n## Background and context\n\n[To be filled...]\n\n## Proposed solutions\n\n* We update the cache (pull-push) only on master pipeline. We can do this via the scheduled master pipeline, so we can dodge https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209864\n* In merge requests, we only pull the cache (pull).\n* The cache can be using a fixed key, so merge requests will all pull cache from master.\n* We need to find a way to expire older packages cached in the cache. For `gems` we may be using `bundle install --clean` so it'll remove packages we're not using. However, we cannot do this if we're merging `vendor/ruby` and `vendor/gitaly-ruby`, because otherwise it'll remove packages from the other `Gemfile.lock`. Or we may run `bundle install --clean` for `vendor/ruby` first, and then `bundle install` for `vendor/gitaly-ruby` next without `--clean`, so it'll not remove packages needed for GitLab Rails but not for Gitaly-ruby.\n* We need to find the same solution for `yarn install` and `node_modules`.\n* We need to find the same solution for `.go/pkg/mod` aw well\n\n/cc @gl-quality/eng-prod \n\n## References\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/1797\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215507\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32508\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218396","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-19T16:22:14.982Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T11:15:49.679Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T11:15:49.613Z","closed_by":{"id":423915,"username":"godfat","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8c73dab2ecd23d5b5627a0235ae2f9b1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","ci-build","ep::pipeline","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"}],"author":{"id":423915,"username":"godfat","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8c73dab2ecd23d5b5627a0235ae2f9b1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218440","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218440","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218440/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/218440/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#218440","relative":"#218440","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#218440"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
