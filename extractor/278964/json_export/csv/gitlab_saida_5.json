I think it would be a lighter touch and would mean the import has minimal knowledge of how the IIDs are expected to be constructed.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e In the case of GitHub issues, it looks like they're imported one-by-one, but we could still try using this method [around here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/906da5e51551442e0c184bb3c21cbd0a1020268f/lib/gitlab/github_import/importer/issue_importer.rb#L63) at the point where we insert the issue record into the database. \n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e Issue.with_project_iid_supply(project) do |supply|\n    \u003e   attributes[:iid] = supply.next_value\n    \u003e   insert_and_return_id(attributes, project.issues)\n    \u003e end\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e For other importers, they might bulk insert a bunch of records at a time, which would also work nicely with this method.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e It also feels like it addresses the cause of the problem which is that our `Representations::` objects [set static `iid`s](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a2658813f855b94e5920526c4bfb9f7f7083235e/lib/gitlab/github_import/representation/issue.rb#L27) which is assuming too much.

So, if the imported protected branch is also protected in GitLab, we will apply the strictest rule for the `code_owner_approval_required` attribute.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-05T11:14:31.553Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T12:03:08.198Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T12:47:01.920Z","closed_by":{"id":11311967,"username":"cervols-ext","name":"Tetiana Zavediuk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11311967/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cervols-ext"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Deliverable","Importer:GitHub","SoftServe::Import","backend","devops::manage","documentation","group::import","quad-planning::complete-no-action","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":11311967,"username":"cervols-ext","name":"Tetiana Zavediuk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11311967/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cervols-ext"}],"author":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11311967,"username":"cervols-ext","name":"Tetiana Zavediuk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11311967/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cervols-ext"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376683","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376683","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376683/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376683/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#376683","relative":"#376683","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#376683"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8585,"epic":{"id":584645,"iid":8585,"title":"Import GitHub rules for protected branches","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8585","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":116313807,"iid":376678,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add ability to enable or disable product analytics from admin","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWith #375577 we have added the product analytics admin settings to the UI.

You can check this by changing the selected dropdown items and looking at the querystring. If the IDs are separated by commas, i.e. `?activity=activity=HAS_ISSUE,STILL_DETECTED`, then it's the refactored filter. If they're separated by multiple querystring keys, i.e. `?activity=HAS_ISSUE\u0026activity=STILL_DETECTED`, then it's still the old filter.\n* [x] Verify that on page load, `All activity` is selected.\n* [x] Verify that only one item per group can be selected, but multiple items across groups can be selected.\n* [x] Verify that when one item is selected, the dropdown button will show the item name. When multiple items are selected, the dropdown button should show \"Item name +1 more\", where the number reflects the number of additional items selected beyond the first one.\n* [x] Verify that selecting `All activity` will select it and unselect everything else.\n* [x] Verify that unchecking the last selected item will automatically check `All activity`.\n* [x] Verify that the selected items are saved to the querystring.

However, the migration to Vue 2.7 is still a WIP \u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375595\n- As an iterative approach, we can explore the use of mixins (and create a follow up to

It looks like the Login button was never clicked, and the form was never posted to the action endpoint.\n- Inspecting the customer's login form shows that there was more than one button on the page. The first button on the page was a navigation button that was not displayed to the user.\n- The customer's log (redacted) shows the following:\n  ```\n  DBG BROWS found nodes for css selector count=1 query=\"button[type=submit]\" query_time=0.833649\n  DBG BROWS executing navigation action=\"[button class=... type=submit]\" action_type=LeftClick\n  DBG BROWS found nodes for css selector count=2 query=button query_time=0.640617\n  ```\n  This shows:\n  1. The DOM was searched using the `DAST_SUBMIT_FIELD` query selector, `button[type=submit]`. **One** result was found.\n  2. The Browser attempts to left-click the resulting HTML element.\n  3. When clicking the button, the browser searched for the query selector `button` and found **two** results. Presumably the first was clicked, which would have been the hidden navigation button as it appears first in the DOM.\n \n\n## Proposal\n\n- Investigate how an element is found on the page when applying an action to the DOM (navigating). Losing query selector information, such as going from  `button[type=submit]` to `button`, is clearly incorrect.\n- If necessary, HTML elements should be returned with the selector that was used to find them. There should be no doubt as to ability to find the same element on the page.\n\n## Reference\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374145\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Write a browser test that attempts to click on the wrong button.

Call `Security.SetOverrideCertificateErrors` to indicate that DAST should handle certificate errors\n1. Subscribe to the event `Security.certificateError`\n1. When the event is received, call `Security.HandleCertificateError` with the action `continue`.\n\nThis poses the following problems:\n\n- The DAST log is littered with `handling certificate 'error'`\n- Customers get confused that the certificate is potentially the problem of failed scans, when the problem is unrelated\n- Presumably, the browser has to wait until the handle response is sent. This could cause race conditions, or add unnecessary wait time to the scan.\n- The DevTools description of [Security.certificateError](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Security/#event-certificateError) indicates that only one client per target should call this method at one time. DAST does not use a mutex here, and the event is `async`.\n\n## Proposal\n\nReplace all of the certificate handling with the single DevTools call `Security.setIgnoreCertificateErrors`.\n\n## Reference\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371793\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374145\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Remove call to `Security.SetOverrideCertificateErrors`\n- [x] Remove subscription to `Security.certificateError`\n- [x] Add call to `Security.setIgnoreCertificateErrors`\n- [ ] Log an INFO message when the certificate has been ignored (if this is possible, please check DevTools)\n- [x] Verify working behaviour using end-to-end test `test_check_319_1`\n- [ ] Manually test using HTTPS websites","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-04T12:37:03.390Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T03:19:28.405Z","closed_at":"2022-11-24T03:34:07.260Z","closed_by":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"labels":["Category:DAST","dast::browserker","devops::secure","feature::enhancement","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"}],"author":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron Swords","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b729cf96bcced6384ebb94f0362bd4b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cam_swords"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376286","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":4},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376286","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376286/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376286/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#376286","relative":"#376286","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#376286"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9023,"epic":{"id":626240,"iid":9023,"title":"Browser-based DAST GA","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9023","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":116249411,"iid":376283,"project_id":278964,"title":"GitHub importer: give feedback to the user on gists that were skipped as too big or didn't import because of other reasons","description":"### Release notes\n\nYou can now bulk-import your GitHub personal gists to GitLab personal snippets via API, however gists larger than 10 files are skipped.

https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8670\n\nThere are currently 2 Slack integrations:\n\n* Slack notifications: set up starting point is in Slack app. Sends notifications from GitLab to Slack\n* Slack application: set up starting point is GitLab. Allows users to type `/commands` to do actions in GitLab\n\nSlack notifications will be deprecated and its functionality will be brought into Slack application.\n\nAs a first step, we will be adding notification functionality to Slack application (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372410)\n\n## Problem\nIn order for the notifications functionality in Slack application to work, the user needs to update to the latest version of Slack application. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374720, we will be able to track which version of Slack application the user is on. \n\nWhen we have that information, we will be able to let the user know if they need to update their Slack application in order to have notification functionality work.\n\n## Proposal \n\nWhen the user needs to update Slack, tell them and do not allow them to use notification functionality until they do so:\n\n| Before | Proposal |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Frame_34](/uploads/add60a1ae02c42c34f486dcef9842b94/Frame_34.png) | ![Frame_35](/uploads/2ad9a57fcb711821cc99de82305e036c/Frame_35.png) |\n| Banner is shown to everyone, regardless if their Slack is up-to-date, users can use notification functionality | We detect if they are not up-to-date, do not allow them to use notifications functionality until they update. Banner is shown conditionally |\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nSince the initial frontend implementation relies on backend work that hasn't been completed yet, suggestions are:\n* Write frontend component or integration specs that validate that the alert shows/is hidden and the fields are disabled or not based on a mocked response from the backend.  This will also help clarify the contract that the frontend will need.\n* After the backend feature is implemented, consider following up with a feature spec that mocks the api responses from Slack.  Please feel free to ping @sgregory2 for assistance needed on this.  \n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the Quality Engineering quad planning and test planning processes and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance. \nQuad Planning: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quality-engineering/quad-planning \nTest Planning: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quality-engineering/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-04T01:06:18.706Z","updated_at":"2022-12-19T09:49:02.622Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T10:03:01.547Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Integration::Slack","Stretch","UX","blocked","devops::manage","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::integrations","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"}],"author":{"id":9608331,"username":"katiemacoy","name":"Katie Macoy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9608331/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/katiemacoy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376240","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376240","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376240/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/376240/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#376240","relative":"#376240","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#376240"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8670,"epic":{"id":595009,"iid":8670,"title":"Extend Slack app to support notifications","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8670","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":116219583,"iid":376239,"project_id":278964,"title":"Spike Research: Using ClickHouse as the datastore for the Exec Dashboard","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nData-driven optimization of SDLC requires a centralized view of **all** the DevOps metrics that available in GitLab. \n\n1.

SCIM API endpoint support at instance level","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn order to extend SCIM support for self managed users, we need to add SCIM API such that it can support individual instance level resources. This task contains the high level scope for that effort. @bdenkovych has proposed starting with the following changes in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12823#note_1083854586.\n\n* Refactor `ScimIdentity` to allow identity creation without a group. Treat such identities to be related to instance level.\n* Extend `ScimFinder`. Add possibility to search for instance level-related identities(those ones that are not scoped to a group)\n* Extend `::EE::Gitlab::Scim::ProvisioningService.new(group, params)`. Make `group` argument to be optional. Apply provisioning steps for instance level if there is no group.\n* Extend `::EE::Gitlab::Scim::ReprovisionService.new(identity)`. If passed scim identity is not tied to a group then apply steps for instance level - unblock user.\n* Extend `::EE::Gitlab::Scim::DeprovisionService.new(identity)`. If passed scim identity is not tied to a group then apply steps for instance level - block user.\n* Add the endpoints\n\u003c!-- Consider adding related issues and epics to this issue.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set webhook_form_mask_url \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set webhook_form_mask_url \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set webhook_form_mask_url true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete webhook_form_mask_url --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `webhook_form_mask_url`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `webhook_form_mask_url` feature flag.

It is a good idea to structure your merge requests this way as well:\n\n1. Modify database schemas to prepare to add Geo support for Dependency Proxy Manifests\n1. Implement Geo support of Dependency Proxy Manifests behind a feature flag\n1. Release Geo support of Dependency Proxy Manifests\n\nIt is also a good idea to first open a proof-of-concept merge request. It can be helpful for working out kinks and getting initial support and feedback from the Geo team. As an example, see the [Proof of Concept to replicate Pipeline Artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56423).\n\nYou can look into the following examples of MRs for implementing replication/verification for a new blob type:\n- [Add db changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60935) and [add verification for MR diffs using SSF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63309)\n- [Verify Terraform state versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58800)\n- [Verify LFS objects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63981)\n\n### Modify database schemas to prepare to add Geo support for Dependency Proxy Manifests\n\nYou might do this section in its own merge request, but it is not required.\n\n#### Add the registry table to track replication and verification state\n\nGeo secondary sites have a [Geo tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/geo.md#tracking-database) independent of the main database. It is used to track the replication and verification state of all replicables. Every Model has a corresponding \"registry\" table in the Geo tracking database.\n\n- [ ] Create the migration file in `ee/db/geo/migrate`:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rails generate migration CreateDependencyProxyManifestRegistry --database geo\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Replace the contents of the migration file with the following. Note that we cannot add a foreign key constraint on `dependency_proxy_manifest_id` because the `dependency_proxy_manifests` table is in a different database. The application code must handle logic such as propagating deletions.\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class CreateDependencyProxyManifestRegistry \u003c Gitlab::Database::Migration[2.0]\n    def change\n      create_table :dependency_proxy_manifest_registry, id: :bigserial, force: :cascade do |t|\n        t.bigint :dependency_proxy_manifest_id, null: false\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :created_at, null: false\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :last_synced_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :retry_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verified_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_started_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_retry_at\n        t.integer :state, default: 0, null: false, limit: 2\n        t.integer :verification_state, default: 0, null: false, limit: 2\n        t.integer :retry_count, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n        t.integer :verification_retry_count, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n        t.boolean :checksum_mismatch, default: false, null: false\n        t.binary :verification_checksum\n        t.binary :verification_checksum_mismatched\n        t.text :verification_failure, limit: 255\n        t.text :last_sync_failure, limit: 255\n\n        t.index :dependency_proxy_manifest_id, name: :index_dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_on_dependency_proxy_manifest_id, unique: true\n        t.index :retry_at\n        t.index :state\n        # To optimize performance of DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.verification_failed_batch\n        t.index :verification_retry_at, name: :dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_failed_verification, order: \"NULLS FIRST\", where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = 3))\"\n        # To optimize performance of DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.needs_verification_count\n        t.index :verification_state, name: :dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_needs_verification, where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = ANY (ARRAY[0, 3])))\"\n        # To optimize performance of DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.verification_pending_batch\n        t.index :verified_at, name: :dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_pending_verification, order: \"NULLS FIRST\", where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = 0))\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] If deviating from the above example, then be sure to order columns according to [our guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/ordering_table_columns.md).\n\n- [ ] Add the new table to the GitLab Schema defined in [`ee/lib/ee/gitlab/database/gitlab_schemas.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/database/gitlab_schemas.yml).\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependency_proxy_manifest_registry: :gitlab_geo\n   ```\n\n- [ ] Run Geo tracking database migrations:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rake db:migrate:geo\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Be sure to commit the relevant changes in `ee/db/geo/structure.sql`\n\n### Add verification state fields on the Geo primary site\n\nThe Geo primary site needs to checksum every replicable so secondaries can verify their own checksums.

Implement replication and verification\n\n- [ ] Add the following lines to the `dependency_proxy_manifest` model to accomplish some important tasks:\n  - Include `::Geo::ReplicableModel` in the `DependencyProxyManifest` class, and specify the Replicator class `with_replicator Geo::DependencyProxyManifestReplicator`.\n  - Include the `::Geo::VerifiableModel` concern.\n  - Delegate verification related methods to the `dependency_proxy_manifest_state` model.\n  - For verification, override some scopes to use the `dependency_proxy_manifest_states` table instead of the model table.\n  - Implement the `verification_state_object` method to return the object that holds\n    the verification details\n  - Override some methods to use the `dependency_proxy_manifest_states` table in verification-related queries.\n\n  At this point the `DependencyProxyManifest` class should look like this:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class DependencyProxyManifest \u003c ApplicationRecord\n    ...\n    include ::Geo::ReplicableModel\n    include ::Geo::VerifiableModel\n\n    delegate(*::Geo::VerificationState::VERIFICATION_METHODS, to: :dependency_proxy_manifest_state)\n\n    with_replicator Geo::DependencyProxyManifestReplicator\n\n    mount_uploader :file, DependencyProxyManifestUploader\n\n    has_one :dependency_proxy_manifest_state, autosave: false, inverse_of: :dependency_proxy_manifest, class_name: 'Geo::DependencyProxyManifestState'\n\n    after_save :save_verification_details\n\n    scope :with_verification_state, -\u003e(state) { joins(:dependency_proxy_manifest_state).where(dependency_proxy_manifest_states: { verification_state: verification_state_value(state) }) }\n    scope :checksummed, -\u003e { joins(:dependency_proxy_manifest_state).where.not(dependency_proxy_manifest_states: { verification_checksum: nil } ) }\n    scope :not_checksummed, -\u003e { joins(:dependency_proxy_manifest_state).where(dependency_proxy_manifest_states: { verification_checksum: nil } ) }\n\n    scope :available_verifiables, -\u003e { joins(:dependency_proxy_manifest_state) }\n\n    # Override the `all` default if not all records can be replicated.

It is called when\n        # we want to know which records to replicate. This is not easy to automate\n        # because for example:\n        #\n        # * The \"selective sync\" feature allows admins to choose which namespaces\n        #   to replicate, per secondary site. Most Models are scoped to a\n        #   namespace, but the nature of the relationship to a namespace varies\n        #   between Models.\n        # * The \"selective sync\" feature allows admins to choose which shards to\n        #   replicate, per secondary site. Repositories are associated with\n        #   shards. Most blob types are not, but Project Uploads are.\n        # * Remote stored replicables are not replicated, by default. But the\n        #   setting `sync_object_storage` enables replication of remote stored\n        #   replicables.\n        #\n        # Search the codebase for examples, and consult a Geo expert if needed.\n      end\n\n      override :verification_state_table_class\n      def verification_state_table_class\n        DependencyProxyManifestState\n      end\n    end\n\n    def dependency_proxy_manifest_state\n      super || build_dependency_proxy_manifest_state\n    end\n\n    ...\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Implement `DependencyProxyManifest.replicables_for_current_secondary` above.\n- [ ] Ensure `DependencyProxyManifest.replicables_for_current_secondary` is well-tested. Search the codebase for `replicables_for_current_secondary` to find examples of parameterized table specs. You may need to add more `FactoryBot` traits.\n- [ ] Add the following shared examples to `ee/spec/models/ee/dependency_proxy_manifest_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n    include_examples 'a replicable model with a separate table for verification state' do\n      let(:verifiable_model_record) { build(:dependency_proxy_manifest) } # add extra params if needed to make sure the record is included in `available_verifiables`\n      let(:unverifiable_model_record) { build(:dependency_proxy_manifest) } # add extra params if needed to make sure the record is NOT included in `available_verifiables`\n    end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/replicators/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_replicator.rb`. Implement the `#carrierwave_uploader` method which should return a `CarrierWave::Uploader`, and implement the class method `.model` to return the `DependencyProxyManifest` class:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class DependencyProxyManifestReplicator \u003c Gitlab::Geo::Replicator\n      include ::Geo::BlobReplicatorStrategy\n      extend ::Gitlab::Utils::Override\n\n      def self.model\n        ::DependencyProxyManifest\n      end\n\n      def carrierwave_uploader\n        model_record.file\n      end\n\n      override :verification_feature_flag_enabled?\n      def self.verification_feature_flag_enabled?\n        # We are adding verification at the same time as replication, so we\n        # don't need to toggle verification separately from replication. When\n        # the replication feature flag is off, then verification is also off\n        # (see `VerifiableReplicator.verification_enabled?`)\n        true\n      end\n\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Generate the feature flag definition file by running the feature flag commands and following the command prompts:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/feature-flag --ee geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_replication --type development --group 'group::geo'\n  bin/feature-flag --ee geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_verification --type development --group 'group::geo'\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add this replicator class to the method `replicator_classes` in\n  `ee/lib/gitlab/geo.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  REPLICATOR_CLASSES = [\n    ::Geo::PackageFileReplicator,\n    ::Geo::DependencyProxyManifestReplicator\n  ]\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/replicators/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_replicator_spec.rb` and perform the necessary setup to define the `model_record` variable for the shared examples:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::DependencyProxyManifestReplicator do\n    let(:model_record) { build(:dependency_proxy_manifest) }\n\n    include_examples 'a blob replicator'\n    include_examples 'a verifiable replicator'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/models/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class DependencyProxyManifestRegistry \u003c Geo::BaseRegistry\n      include ::Geo::ReplicableRegistry\n      include ::Geo::VerifiableRegistry\n\n      MODEL_CLASS = ::DependencyProxyManifest\n      MODEL_FOREIGN_KEY = :dependency_proxy_manifest_id\n\n      belongs_to :dependency_proxy_manifest, class_name: 'DependencyProxyManifest'\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Update `REGISTRY_CLASSES` in `ee/app/workers/geo/secondary/registry_consistency_worker.rb`.\n- [ ] Add a custom factory name if needed in `def model_class_factory_name` in `ee/spec/support/helpers/ee/geo_helpers.rb`.\n- [ ] Update `it 'creates missing registries for each registry class'` in `ee/spec/workers/geo/secondary/registry_consistency_worker_spec.rb`.\n- [ ] Add `dependency_proxy_manifest_registry` to `ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections` in `config/initializers_before_autoloader/000_inflections.rb`.\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/factories/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  FactoryBot.define do\n    factory :geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_registry, class: 'Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry' do\n      dependency_proxy_manifest # This association should have data, like a file or repository\n      state { Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.state_value(:pending) }\n\n      trait :synced do\n        state { Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.state_value(:synced) }\n        last_synced_at { 5.days.ago }\n      end\n\n      trait :failed do\n        state { Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.state_value(:failed) }\n        last_synced_at { 1.day.ago }\n        retry_count { 2 }\n        last_sync_failure { 'Random error' }\n      end\n\n      trait :started do\n        state { Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.state_value(:started) }\n        last_synced_at { 1.day.ago }\n        retry_count { 0 }\n      end\n\n      trait :verification_succeeded do\n        verification_checksum { 'e079a831cab27bcda7d81cd9b48296d0c3dd92ef' }\n        verification_state { Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry.verification_state_value(:verification_succeeded) }\n        verified_at { 5.days.ago }\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/models/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistry, :geo, type: :model do\n    let_it_be(:registry) { create(:geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_registry) }\n\n    specify 'factory is valid' do\n      expect(registry).to be_valid\n    end\n\n    include_examples 'a Geo framework registry'\n    include_examples 'a Geo verifiable registry'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add the following to `spec/factories/dependency_proxy_manifests.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  trait :verification_succeeded do\n    with_file\n    verification_checksum { 'abc' }\n    verification_state { DependencyProxyManifest.verification_state_value(:verification_succeeded) }\n  end\n\n  trait :verification_failed do\n    with_file\n    verification_failure { 'Could not calculate the checksum' }\n    verification_state { DependencyProxyManifest.verification_state_value(:verification_failed) }\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Make sure the factory also allows setting a `project` attribute. If the model does not have a direct relation to a project, you can use a `transient` attribute. Check out `spec/factories/merge_request_diffs.rb` for an example.\n\n- [ ] Following [the example of Merge Request Diffs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63309) add a `Geo::DependencyProxyManifestState` model in `ee/app/models/ee/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_state.rb`:\n\n  ``` ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class DependencyProxyManifestState \u003c ApplicationRecord\n      include EachBatch\n      include ::Geo::VerificationStateDefinition\n\n      self.primary_key = :dependency_proxy_manifest_id\n\n      belongs_to :dependency_proxy_manifest, inverse_of: :dependency_proxy_manifest_state\n\n      validates :verification_failure, length: { maximum: 255 }\n      validates :verification_state, :dependency_proxy_manifest, presence: true\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add a `factory` for `dependency_proxy_manifest_state`, in `ee/spec/factories/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_states.rb`:\n\n  ``` ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  FactoryBot.define do\n    factory :geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_state, class: 'Geo::DependencyProxyManifestState' do\n      dependency_proxy_manifest\n\n      trait :checksummed do\n        verification_checksum { 'abc' }\n      end\n\n      trait :checksum_failure do\n        verification_failure { 'Could not calculate the checksum' }\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n#### Step 2. Implement metrics gathering\n\nMetrics are gathered by `Geo::MetricsUpdateWorker`, persisted in `GeoNodeStatus` for display in the UI, and sent to Prometheus:\n\n- [ ] Add the following fields to Geo Node Status example responses in `doc/api/geo_nodes.md`:\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_checksum_total_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_checksummed_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_checksum_failed_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_synced_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_failed_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_registry_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_verification_total_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_verified_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_verification_failed_count`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_synced_in_percentage`\n  - `dependency_proxy_manifests_verified_in_percentage`\n- [ ] Add the same fields to `GET /geo_nodes/status` example response in\n  `ee/spec/fixtures/api/schemas/public_api/v4/geo_node_status.json`.\n- [ ] Add the following fields to the `Sidekiq metrics` table in `doc/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.md`:\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_checksum_total`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_checksummed`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_checksum_failed`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_synced`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_failed`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_registry`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_verification_total`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_verified`\n  - `geo_dependency_proxy_manifests_verification_failed`\n\nDependency Proxy Manifest replication and verification metrics should now be available in the API, the `Admin \u003e Geo \u003e Nodes` view, and Prometheus.\n\n#### Step 3. Implement the GraphQL API\n\nThe GraphQL API is used by `Admin \u003e Geo \u003e Replication Details` views, and is directly queryable by administrators.\n\n- [ ] Add a new field to `GeoNodeType` in `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  field :dependency_proxy_manifest_registries, ::Types::Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistryType.connection_type,\n        null: true,\n        resolver: ::Resolvers::Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistriesResolver,\n        description: 'Find Dependency Proxy Manifest registries on this Geo node. '\\\n                     'Ignored if `geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_replication` feature flag is disabled.',\n        alpha: { milestone: '15.5' } # Update the milestone\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add the new `dependency_proxy_manifest_registries` field name to the `expected_fields` array in `ee/spec/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type_spec.rb`.\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/graphql/resolvers/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registries_resolver.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Resolvers\n    module Geo\n      class DependencyProxyManifestRegistriesResolver \u003c BaseResolver\n        type ::Types::Geo::GeoNodeType.connection_type, null: true\n\n        include RegistriesResolver\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/graphql/resolvers/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registries_resolver_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Resolvers::Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistriesResolver do\n    it_behaves_like 'a Geo registries resolver', :geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_registry\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/finders/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_finder.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class DependencyProxyManifestRegistryFinder\n      include FrameworkRegistryFinder\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/finders/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_finder_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::DependencyProxyManifestRegistryFinder do\n    it_behaves_like 'a framework registry finder', :geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_registry\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_type.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Types\n    module Geo\n      # rubocop:disable Graphql/AuthorizeTypes because it is included\n      class DependencyProxyManifestRegistryType \u003c BaseObject\n        graphql_name 'DependencyProxyManifestRegistry'\n\n        include ::Types::Geo::RegistryType\n\n        description 'Represents the Geo replication and verification state of a dependency_proxy_manifest'\n\n        field :dependency_proxy_manifest_id, GraphQL::Types::ID, null: false, description: 'ID of the Dependency Proxy Manifest.'\n      end\n      # rubocop:enable Graphql/AuthorizeTypes\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/graphql/types/geo/dependency_proxy_manifest_registry_type_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe GitlabSchema.types['DependencyProxyManifestRegistry'] do\n    it_behaves_like 'a Geo registry type'\n\n    it 'has the expected fields (other than those included in RegistryType)' do\n      expected_fields = %i[dependency_proxy_manifest_id]\n\n      expect(described_class).to have_graphql_fields(*expected_fields).at_least\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add integration tests for providing DependencyProxyManifest registry data to the frontend via the GraphQL API, by duplicating and modifying the following shared examples in `ee/spec/requests/api/graphql/geo/registries_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  it_behaves_like 'gets registries for', {\n    field_name: 'dependencyProxyManifestRegistries',\n    registry_class_name: 'DependencyProxyManifestRegistry',\n    registry_factory: :geo_dependency_proxy_manifest_registry,\n    registry_foreign_key_field_name: 'dependencyProxyManifestId'\n  }\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Update the GraphQL reference documentation:\n\n  ```shell\n  bundle exec rake gitlab:graphql:compile_docs\n  ```\n\nIndividual Dependency Proxy Manifest replication and verification data should now be available via the GraphQL API.\n\n#### Step 4. Handle batch destroy\n\nIf batch destroy logic is implemented for a replicable, then that logic must be \"replicated\" by Geo secondaries. The easiest way to do this is use `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` to bulk insert a delete event for each replicable.\n\nFor example, if `FastDestroyAll` is used, then you may be able to [use `begin_fast_destroy` and `finalize_fast_destroy` hooks, like we did for uploads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69763).\n\nOr if a special service is used to batch delete records and their associated data, then you probably need to [hook into that service, like we did for job artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79530).\n\nAs illustrated by the above two examples, batch destroy logic cannot be handled automatically by Geo secondaries without restricting the way other teams perform batch destroys. It is up to you to produce `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` attributes before the records are deleted, and then enqueue `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` after the records are deleted.\n\n- [ ] Ensure that any batch destroy of this replicable is replicated to secondary sites\n- [ ] Regardless of implementation details, please verify in specs that when the parent object is removed, the new `Geo::Event` records are created:\n\n```ruby\n  describe '#destroy' do\n    subject { create(:dependency_proxy_manifest) }\n\n    context 'when running in a Geo primary node' do\n      let_it_be(:primary) { create(:geo_node, :primary) }\n      let_it_be(:secondary) { create(:geo_node) }\n\n      it 'logs an event to the Geo event log when bulk removal is used', :sidekiq_inline do\n        stub_current_geo_node(primary)\n\n        expect { subject.project.destroy! }.to change(Geo::Event.where(replicable_name: :dependency_proxy_manifest, event_name: :deleted), :count).by(1)\n\n        payload = Geo::Event.where(replicable_name: :dependency_proxy_manifest, event_name: :deleted).last.payload\n\n        expect(payload['model_record_id']).to eq(subject.id)\n        expect(payload['blob_path']).to eq(subject.relative_path)\n        expect(payload['uploader_class']).to eq('DependencyProxyManifestUploader')\n      end\n    end\n  end\n```\n\n### Release Geo support of Dependency Proxy Manifests\n\n- [ ] In the rollout issue you created when creating the feature flag, modify the Roll Out Steps:\n  - [ ] Cross out any steps related to testing on production GitLab.com, because Geo is not running on production GitLab.com at the moment.\n  - [ ] Add a step to `Test replication and verification of Dependency Proxy Manifests on a non-GDK-deployment. For example, using GitLab Environment Toolkit`.\n  - [ ] Add a step to `Ping the Geo PM and EM to coordinate testing`.

These will both end up having `{ component_type: :library, component_name: \"pg\" }` and will collide, even though they are different dependencies.\n\nAs a solution to this, we should add a column onto `sbom_components` to store the\n[package URL type](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst).\nWe will then change the uniqueness constraint for `sbom_components` to be unique by `component_type` + `purl_type` + `name`.\n\n## Relevant links\n\u003c!--\nInformation that the developer might need to refer to when implementing the issue.\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e)\n  - [Design 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n  - [Design 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n- [Similar implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/\u003cid\u003e)\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [ ] Documentation:\n- [ ] Feature flag:\n- [ ] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated.\nThe plan can also call-out responsibilities for other team members or teams and\ncan be split into smaller MRs to simplify the code review process.\n\ne.g.:\n\n- MR 1: Part 1\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 1\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 2\n- MR 2: Part 2\n- [ ] ~backend Step 1\n- [ ] ~backend Step 2\n- MR 3: Part 3\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 1\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 2\n\n--\u003e\n\n1.

Add a new index on `[:component_type, :purl_type, :name]`\n1. Add a package-url parser to GitLab. Perhaps https://github.com/package-url/packageurl-ruby.\n1. Update [`lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/sbom/cyclonedx.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b6c0294bc710b95f0f9d9141b6986d0881f9be23/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/sbom/cyclonedx.rb#L64) to parse the `purl` from the component and add the `purl_type` to the component object.\n1. Update the [`IngestComponents`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/94c30a07ebfc4e1bbad0533f7bf8b685e04ffd40/ee/app/services/sbom/ingestion/tasks/ingest_components.rb#L27) task to store the `purl_type` and be unique by `[:component_type, :purl_type, :name]`\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n# ~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\nOther settings you might want to include when creating the issue.\n\n# /assign @\n# /epic \u0026\n--\u003e\n\n## Verification steps\n\u003c!--\nAdd verification steps to help GitLab team members test the implementation. This is particularly useful\nduring the MR review and the ~\"workflow::verification\" step. You may not know exactly what the\nverification steps should be during issue refinement, so you can always come back later to add\nthem.\n\n1. Check-out the corresponding branch\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n--\u003e\n\n1. Enable the feature flag on your project (please comment / tick this in [the feature flag rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367711))\n2. Create a new project from a template, use the NodeJS/Express template. Make sure that the group which you create this project under has an ultimate plan. \n3. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with this configuration:\n\n    ```yaml\n    include:\n      - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n    ```\n\n4. Verify that the `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` outputs a `gl-sbom-npm-npm.cdx.json` artifact\n5. [Use teleport to connect to the db console](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/Teleport/Connect_to_Database_Console_via_Teleport.md). For production, this will require an access request, but this will be automatically sent to the `#infrastructure-lounge` channel when you run `tsh login` and is usually approved very quickly.\n6. Take this query an paste it inside an editor. Replace `YOUR_PIPELINE_ID` with the ID of your CI pipeline which produced the `gl-sbom-npm-npm.cdx.json` artifact.\n\n   ```sql\n   select\n     name, version, component_type, purl_type, source_id\n   from\n     sbom_components\n   inner join sbom_component_versions\n     on sbom_components.id = sbom_component_versions.component_id\n   inner join sbom_occurrences\n     on sbom_component_versions.id = sbom_occurrences.component_version_id\n   where pipeline_id = YOUR_PIPELINE_ID;\n   ```\n\n7. Paste the query with your pipeline ID into the database console. Verify the `purl_type` is present. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/63a47ad481690a6ecdd9d2f8371ab2c22d2e3fda/app/models/concerns/enums/sbom.rb#L9 for the enum mapping.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003eExample

Python SBoM components on ingestion","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps. They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\u003c!--\nA brief explanation of the why, not the what or how. Assume the reader doesn't know the\nbackground and won't have time to dig-up information from comment threads.\n--\u003e\n\nWhen ingesting SBoM components, [we currently use the literal name received from the report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/49590123337ec859596e372aa4d127465f539a28/ee/app/services/sbom/ingestion/occurrence_map.rb#L20).\nMany languages such as Python consider package names to be case-insensitive, so we need to normalize the component names\nwhen ingesting so that we do not end up with different records for the same component.\n\nIf we don't normalize the names, we might end up with duplicates, that is multiple records of `sbom_components` referring for a single component (served by a package registry).\nIt would be impossible to reference a single `sbom_components` from a vulnerability advisory using a foreign key.\n\nIn particular, names of Python packages should be normalized, so that they can be compared as documented in [PEP0426](https://peps.python.org/pep-0426/#name):\n\n\u003e All comparisons of distribution names MUST be case insensitive, and MUST consider hyphens and underscores to be equivalent.\n\nSee normalization of Python package names in Gemnasium: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v3.9.6/advisory/repo.go#L217\n\nContext: This was raised by @fcatteau in [a previous discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375302#note_1119439505).\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eSee comment\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003e I'm assuming that we store the normalized component names in the database, like `pillow` for Python package `Pillow`. This way each advisory affects exactly one component, and we can have a `vulnerability_advisories.component_id` foreign key.\n\u003e\n\u003e ...\n\u003e\n\u003e I'm not concerned seeding the DB with gemnasium-db b/c its YAML files should contain normalized names, in the `package_slug`.\n\u003e \n\u003e However, that's not the case for project SBOMs being ingested. It's important to normalized component names when ingesting the SBOMs, otherwise we'll end up with duplicates in the case of Python (multiple `sbom_components` referring to the same Python package). Then it would be impossible to set `vulnerability_advisories.component_id` to correct value.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Relevant links\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v3.9.6/advisory/repo.go#L217\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [ ] Documentation:\n- [ ] Feature flag:\n- [ ] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] In `ee/app/services/sbom/ingestion/tasks/ingest_components.rb`, normalize the component name prior to insertion.

Set up a project using the NodeJS/Express template, enable SBOM ingestion, and enable Dependency Scanning as documented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364709#verification-steps.\n1. Add a `requirements.txt` file that contains Django. A new pipeline is triggered.\n1. List components for that pipelines as documented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364709#verification-steps, and check the following:\n   - [x] It contains a record such as name is `cookie-parser`, and PURL type is `npm`.\n   - [x] It contains a record such as name is `django`, and PURL type is `pypi`.\n   - [x] It does NOT contain a record such as name is `Django`, and PURL type is `pypi`.\n \nThis proves that names of `pypi` components are normalized, but names of `npm` components are not.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-29T17:41:16.373Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T15:21:49.448Z","closed_at":"2022-11-24T23:02:48.535Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","WorkingGroup::ContinuousScanning","backend","devops::govern","feature::addition","group::threat insights","missed:15.6","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"}],"author":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375765","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":10,"completed_count":3},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 10 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/375765","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/375765/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/375765/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#375765","relative":"#375765","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#375765"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8024,"epic":{"id":518303,"iid":8024,"title":"Ingest SBOM reports","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8024","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
