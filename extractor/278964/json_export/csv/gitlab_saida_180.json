Another way is to use the `/approve` quick action when submitting a comment, if the reviewer knows about it.\n\nGenerally, a reviewer's decision to approve an MR happens when finishing reviewing the MR, and that moment is usually linked to publishing a comment or submitting a batch of comments. If we are able to link and place the Comment and Approve actions closer together, we should be able to increase the speed of reviews.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd “Approve” option when commenting on an MR or submitting a batch of comments (review).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to approve the MR when leaving a comment or submitting a batch of comments, thereby reducing the time it takes between reviewing and approving the MR.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nOnly project members that can approve the MR will see this option.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* The time between leaving a comment or submitting a review and approving an MR is reduced.\n* The usage of the “Approve” button in the MR widgets is reduced in favor of the option introduced in this issue.\n\n\n### Further details\n\nA developer writes a number of review comments on the MR.  She goes to complete her work, and hits the friendly \"Finish Review\" green button at the bottom of the page.  She forgets that she must also go back to the top of the page and additionally \"Add Approval\".\n\nAnother developer also comments on the MR.  He finishes his work, and returns to the top of the page to add his approval to merge.  There is no indication that he forgot to additionally submit his comments, and the MR originator proceeds to merge with the approval but never seeing any of the comments, which are now lost.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIf the UI has open but unsubmitted review comments, the \"Finish Review\" flow should also give you the choice to additionally add approval at the same time.  The \"Add Approval\" button instead behaves the same as \"Finish Review\", perhaps with the \"and approve\" selected by default.  This requires the reviewer to consider the action of submitting comments and approving (or not) as a single action and does not allow you to forget.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c!--

DinD is only required to be able to orchestrate the analyzers. One solution would be to port the code of the sast orchestrator directly into the runner.\n\nNB: SAST and Dependency scanning share a common library and the same orchestration model, [see Dependency Scanning issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12487)\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/971 for previous comments.\n\n### Intended users\n\n- ~\"Persona: DevOps Engineer\" \n- ~\"Persona: Software developer\" \n\n### Proposal\n\nAs describe [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/971#note_155680650):\n\nIdeally, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml would just contain:\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n  template: SAST-bandit.gitlab-ci.yml\n  template: SAST-brakeman.gitlab-ci.yml\n  template: SAST-gosec.gitlab-ci.yml\n  [...]\n```\n\nSo that we have only one SSOT and one single location to update for analyzers. Users who want to use specific analyzers can use the one-liner `include` directly.\n\n### Tasks\n\n* [ ]  Decide what to do with some variables not being used anymore, like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast#timeouts\n* [x]  Port the report aggregation to the Rails backend (currently done in [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common); ported by #10857)\n* [x]  Port the vulnerabilities deduplication to the Rails backend (currently done in [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common); ported by #10857)\n* [x]  Port other features like \"ignore paths\" to the Rails backend (currently done in [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) (refs #10030)\n* [ ]  Explore improving the CI configuration with files detection https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/971#note_200189550\n* [ ]  Decide on a plan for deprecating, and ultimately archiving the existing [SAST](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast) tool https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/971#note_211694279\n* [ ]  Update the vendored templates\n* [ ]  Update the documentation\n\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] Update https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html\n\n### Testing\n\n- [ ] Update all related tests projects in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nThere is no more orchestration layer for SAST, instead each analyzer has its own job configured by the corresponding vendored template.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-30T01:02:38.652Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T23:09:48.549Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T19:02:09.754Z","closed_by":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::secure","direction","group::static analysis","priority::1","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":731039,"iid":38,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/10/22/gitlab-12-4-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:41:53.212Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:43.889Z","due_date":"2019-10-17","start_date":"2019-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"}],"author":{"id":30915,"username":"plafoucriere","name":"Philippe Lafoucrière","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/30915/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/plafoucriere"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/10796","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":10,"completed_count":3},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 10 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/10796","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/10796/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/10796/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#10796","relative":"#10796","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#10796"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2463,"epic":{"id":18048,"iid":2463,"title":"SAST \u0026 Secret Detection - Make Docker-in-Docker (DinD) optional (not a requirement) for all secure analyzers / scans","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2463","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24692589,"iid":27687,"project_id":278964,"title":"estimate quick action does not produce correct time for 1mo","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label.\n\nFor the Community Edition issue tracker:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nFor the Enterprise Edition issue tracker:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen you use the `/estimate 1mo` quick action (or some other multiple of months), the resulting time listed under `Time tracking` is actually set to 1 month and 2 weeks.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a new issue. In the description, place `/estimate 1mo` on its own line. Then, either preview the text or submit it. You will see that the time estimate will actually be set to `1mo 2w` instead of just `1mo`.\n\nThe same behavior can be seen in other places, for example using the quick action in a comment.\n\n### Example Project\n\nI just created the following issue demonstrating the problem: https://gitlab.com/kmorel/example-project/issues/1\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen you enter a time estimate of 1 month, you get a value of 1 month and 2 weeks. Likewise, a time estimate of 2 months will give you a value of 3 months. The time appears to be inflated by 50%.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen you enter `/estimate 1mo` the estimated time should be set to `1mo`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on Gitlab.com.\n\n(I first observed it on an instance of GitLab Community Edition, but I can see the same behavior on gitlab.com.)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI have not looked at any of the implementation, but what I _suspect_ is happening, is that when you enter `/estimate 1mo`, it is converting 1 month into around 30 days. Then, when the time estimate is printed, it is interpreting those 30 days on a 5 day per week work schedule, which would turn those 30 days into 6 weeks. Assuming 4 weeks is about 1 month, that gives you the unexpected result of 1 month and 2 weeks.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-29T23:20:10.688Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:10:26.536Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T06:38:57.900Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::3","severity::3","time tracking","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"}],"author":{"id":3163510,"username":"kmorel","name":"Kenneth Moreland","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3163510/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmorel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/27687","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/27687","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/27687/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/27687/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#27687","relative":"#27687","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#27687"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":19570857,"iid":10795,"project_id":278964,"title":"View epic tree in epic","description":"\n### Designs\n\n| Discussion tab | Tree tab | Roadmap tab |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Artboard_Copy_9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/657aca5a351e64af368954bcbdac7ee9/Artboard_Copy_9.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7.26.19_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/2bedf2374c75ddcee2167338c5953239/Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7.26.19_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7.29.33_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/00c08e7912477235b9566ab24f09b026/Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7.29.33_AM.png) |\n\n* First tab is discussion - comments, threads, and system notes\n* Second tab is the tree view.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nYou can now search the list of environments in the Environments page by name.

Please note that this feature is not yet complete, and you can only search for an exact match of the environment name.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a user, I want to search for environments in GitLab, so that I can quickly find an environment and its deployments.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* Anyone who uses the Environments page at an organization that has a lot of environments.\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

That means users need to be on a specific tab to search for these type of environments. (_known limitation_)\n* The user can search by typing.\n    * The keyword needs to match with the **exact** user's search query so that the result can be displayed. (_known limitation_)\n    * **The minimum limit on the length of the search is 3 characters**\n    * When the user type into the search box, the system scans both environments and scoped environments.\n    * When returning the results, the environment folders remain collapsed, even if the matched result is part of a scoped environment. (_known limitation_)\n    * When returning scoped environments in the results, the folder structure should be persistent. That means the UI should display the the parent and child structure in the UI, when returning a child (scoped) environment.\n* The badge counter in the Tab navigation should updated to match the number of results being displayed.\n* The badge counter in the scoped environment folder should updated to match the number of results being displayed.\n* Some characters cannot be used in environment names and therefore should not return a result during search. For more information about the environment keywords, see the [.gitlab-ci.yml keyword reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#environment).\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nToday, when searching for a particular environment on GitLab.com, users have to manually to step through all 56 pages to find the one they're looking for.

Metrics threshold configurable","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThis is a follow up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/57881.\nWe would definitely not want to alert developers for minor drop in metrics. \nIs there a way to control the sensitivity of the alerts - maybe defining a threshold/range of values for each of the metric would be helpful to avoid any unnecessary alarms. \n\nCould you please provide some thoughts on this? /cc @joshlambert\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n* When Sasha makes a change that results in overall performance score, transfer size, speed index or requests to degrade by a small amount, they do not want to be bothered by alarms in the [Performance Metrics Widget](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/browser_performance_testing.html#how-it-works) so they can ship valuable features.\n** This is addressed.\n* When Web Performance has decreased a significant amount over a set number of builds, Sasha wants to see alarms in the Performance Metrics Widget, so that customers do not stop using the website/app because of degraded performance.\n** This use case will not be addressed by this change.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add to the variables a keyword to specify the degradation threshold for display of the widget.\n* This threshold should trigger off of the `total_score` so any degradation greater or equal to that value triggers display of the widget in the MR. If the degradation is less than the threshold do not display the widget.\n* This will be an optional variable and if the value is not set the widget will always display.\n* The pipeline passing/failing will not be impacted by the results of the widget displaying / the threshold being exceeded. This is informational only for the user.\n\nSample usage:\n```\nstages:\n  - performance\n\ninclude:\n  template: Verify/Browser-Performance.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nperformance:\n  variables:\n    URL: https://example.com\n    DEGRADATION_THRESHOLD: 5\n```\n\n#### Outcomes\n* When Sasha sets up the web performance job, they want to specify for the various metric types how big of a degradation will trigger an alert in the MR Widget, so that they can ship valuable features.\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n* The [feature documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/browser_performance_testing.html) needs updated as the issue called out has been completed.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n* Web Performance can be configured by a user through the gitlab-ci.yml\n* Users trust that web performance will not slowly degrade over time without alarms eg; a [boiled frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog).\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\nThe buyer and user of this feature is the developer who will set and tweak the setting.\n\n### Links /

indexing just covers that code push itself. The idea is to use `IndexStatus#last_commit` to just cover all of the gaps.\n\nFor repositories, we *do* store state - the commit that was last indexed.

For example, if I have a file with `a.b.c=one_two_three` and I search for `one_two_three`, I don't get the file returned in the search. \n\nWe have improved the code analyzer in Elasticsearch and it is now it is more robust at matching searches with special characters.\n\n\n### Examples\nCurrent Languages Impacted:\n\n| Language | Impacted Count |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| PHP | 4 |\n| Java | 3 | \n| Python | 2 |\n| XML | 2 |\n| C (makefile) | 1 |\n| Puppet | 1 |\n| Terraform | 1 |\n| Rust | 1 |\n| Clojure | 1 |\n| Lisp | 1 |\n| Markdown | 1 |\n| Ruby | 1 |\n| JSON | 1 |\n| C# DotNet | 1 |\n\nCustomer ticket initially reporting this issue: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/116884\n\n### Important\n\n**UPDATE**\nCode analyzer is defined in this file: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5e78106230570f0eea4396de76eee357ba40cfac/ee/lib/elastic/latest/config.rb#L54 \n\nThe code is tokenized on whitespace, and then those tokens are put through various filters, including the custom code filter:\n\n```\n\"code\": {\n  \"type\": \"pattern_capture\",\n  \"preserve_original\": \"true\",\n  \"patterns\": [\n    \"(\\\\p{Ll}+|\\\\p{Lu}\\\\p{Ll}+|\\\\p{Lu}+)\",\n    \"(\\\\d+)\",\n    \"(?=([\\\\p{Lu}]+[\\\\p{L}]+))\",\n    \"\\\"((?:\\\\\\\"|[^\\\"]|\\\\\\\")*)\\\"\",\n    \"'((?:\\\\'|[^']|\\\\')*)'\",\n    \"\\\\.([^.]+)(?=\\\\.|\\\\s|\\\\Z)\",\n    \"\\\\/?([^\\\\/]+)(?=\\\\/|\\\\b)\"\n  ]\n},\n```\n\nThe current custom patterns account for quotes, periods, and path terms. They don't account for other special characters, like equal signs in this case. I added the following pattern to the code filter to account for equal signs, and I was able to search for this file successfully after reconfiguring and reindexing:\n\n```\n'\\=?([^=]+)(?=\\=|\\b)' # separate terms on equal signs\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOn an instance with the Elasticsearch integration, create a project with 4 files that contain the following:\n\n- fileA.md: `one_two_three=a.b.c`\n- fileB.md: `a.b.c=one_two_three`\n- fileC.md: `one_two_three = a.b.c`\n- fileD.md: `a.b.c = one_two_three`\n\nSearch for `one_two_three`, and you'll get files A, C, and D returned but not file B.\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis cannot be reproduced on GitLab.com because GitLab.com doesn't use Elasticsearch at this time.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe search with the Elasticsearch integration doesn't return the correct results because the custom code filter doesn't take into account various code cases, including special characters with no whitespace.\n\nSpecial characters not supported (customer found):\n\n```\n= # equal signs\n, # commas\n( # open parentheses\n) # close parentheses\n:: # double colon\n: # colon\n-\u003e # arrow\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Elasticsearch should try to account for various code cases, including this specific case where there are equal signs with no whitespace.\n\n### Output of checks\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\t\tUbuntu 16.04\nProxy:\t\tno\nCurrent User:\tgit\nUsing RVM:\tno\nRuby Version:\t2.5.3p105\nGem Version:\t2.7.6\nBundler Version:1.16.6\nRake Version:\t12.3.2\nRedis Version:\t3.2.12\nGit Version:\t2.18.1\nSidekiq Version:5.2.5\nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:\t11.9.1-ee\nRevision:\tb50dc44\nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:\tpostgresql\nDB Version:\t9.6.11\nURL:\t\thttp://198.199.92.126\nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://198.199.92.126/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@198.199.92.126:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:\tyes\nGeo:\t\tno\nUsing LDAP:\tyes\nUsing Omniauth:\tyes\nOmniauth Providers: saml, group_saml\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:\t8.7.1\nRepository storage paths:\n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm:  \n\n\u003e Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on Salesforce servers in conjunction with calls to the API. Using syntax that looks like Java and acts like database stored procedures, Apex enables developers to add business logic to most system events, including button clicks, related record updates, and Visualforce pages. Apex code can be initiated by Web service requests and from triggers on objects.\n\nPMD is an open source tool that is able to scan APEX code.

This is time consuming and not very efficient. \n\nUntil https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11238 is implemented we must use a workaround to ensure we are accurately checking downstream projects. [Otherwise, downstreams are ignored](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/pipelines/52118635). This will involve using a simple loop within our `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration that triggers the job and waits until the job has reported as finished (either a success or failure).\n\nAnother problem with our current `fixtures` is that analyzers work off the first compatible project identifier, so a project with 2 separate `package.json` files will only be scanned once (the first one found) when an analyzer works on the repo directly. This can be shown with the recent bug https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10564, where the workaround is to rely on a [`test.sh` integration test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/blob/v2.0.0/test.sh) to run multiple scans.\n\n## Desired behavior\n\n![Image_2019-03-25_at_10.42.12](/uploads/24c685d461a04039b8bf9aba9764b780/Image_2019-03-25_at_10.42.12.png)\n\n### Intended users\n\n~\"Persona: Software developer\" \n\n### Further details\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Define `qa` template job within [`analyzer.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/raw/master/includes-dev/analyzer.yml)\n2. Within template job define helper functions: `trigger_job` and `wait_for_job_to_be_done` ([see inspiration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/1759ea1860637f0e297a2572038b54338cf1511a/scripts/utils.sh#L117-158))\n3. Within template job export the `IMAGE_TAG` to allow analyzers to run with predefined image; i.e. `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGES=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG=$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`\n4. Setup analyzer project to use `qa` template jobs to trigger downstream pipelines and pass *ONLY IF* downstreams are successful\n\n\nExample yaml:\n\n```yaml\nvariables:\n  REPORT_FILENAME: gl-dependency-scanning-report.json\n  MAJOR: 2\n\nstages:\n  - go\n  - build\n  - qa\n  - deploy\n\ninclude:\n  - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/raw/master/includes-dev/analyzer.yml\n\nqa_trigger java_maven:\n  extends: .qa_trigger\n  variables:\n    QA_PROJECT: \"java-maven\"\n    SAST_DISABLED: \"true\"\n\nqa_check java_maven:\n  extends: .qa_check\n  variables:\n    QA_PROJECT: \"java-maven\"\n```\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\nAny workflow and QA changes should be properly documented within QA process: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/release/blob/master/docs/qa_process.md\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nChanges to a wrapper project (i.e. ~sast) will automatically trigger downstream pipelines for all relevant test projects. This will allow us to ensure our wrapper projects have the expected behavior across a variety of configurations without requiring manual testing.\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-25T18:44:57.600Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T12:16:00.257Z","closed_at":"2019-10-15T14:24:16.317Z","closed_by":{"id":3696420,"username":"caneldem","name":"Can Eldem","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3696420/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caneldem"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","Stretch","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","test","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":731039,"iid":38,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/10/22/gitlab-12-4-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:41:53.212Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:43.889Z","due_date":"2019-10-17","start_date":"2019-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[{"id":3696420,"username":"caneldem","name":"Can Eldem","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3696420/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caneldem"}],"author":{"id":401232,"username":"theoretick","name":"Lucas Charles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/401232/squares-nail-wall-art.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/theoretick"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3696420,"username":"caneldem","name":"Can Eldem","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3696420/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caneldem"},"user_notes_count":30,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/10658","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/10658","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/10658/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/10658/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#10658","relative":"#10658","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#10658"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24692148,"iid":27535,"project_id":278964,"title":"Buttons for creating content files in new project should be linked to Web IDE","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs a follow up on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/45687, it has been decided to split scope of that issue so that linking the \"New file\", \"Add LICENSE\", etc buttons in freshly-created project would link to Web IDE.

with Geo, we disable the replication code, as we assume the Object Storage will be configured to handle that.\n\nThat is not always the case, if the user is not using a cloud solution that supports replication, or if they are using a local storage appliance that does not support replication logic.\n\nEven in the case where the user has access to a cloud solution, they may still need to backfill any additional node, when bootstrapping from an existing installation, which is usually not a supported feature from cloud providers.\n\n---\n\nIn order to provide a minimal Object Storage replication functionality we need to make some changes:\n\n* [x] Cover current download logic with specs (not everything is being tested) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/13997\n* [x] Add settings to Geo Node to enable/disable syncing files in Object Storage https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/15139\n* [x] Make it possible to download files stored in Object Storage via sync API and upload to another Object Storage https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/15606\n* [x] Remove hard-coded restrictions on all finders to expose both `local` and `remote` files (remote means Object Storage) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/13997\n* [x] Implement a new restriction on finders based on GeoNode settings.

This prevents from matching a given feedback with a vulnerability reported on the Group Security Dashboard and the \"same\" vulnerability displayed on the other places (MR, Pipeline, Project Dashboard).\n\nThis issue already happens for various reasons (code is updated, so fingerprint is updated) and that's why the feedback feature is still considered unstable, but this specific bug adds more misses that could be avoided.\n\n**Important consideration:** A side effect of updating ~frontend fingerprint generation is that we will loose all existing feedback created for Container Scanning and DAST on MRs, Pipeline view and Project Dashboard since we launched them. By loosing I don't mean we will drop created records from DB, but that we might not be able to display them anymore. E.g. the issue will still exists, but you won't see it attached to your vulnerability. Though this seems aligned with our [Alpha stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha) description: `data loss can occur (be that through bugs or updates)`.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- create a feedback (issue or dismissal) on a vulnerability reported on the project dashboard for Container Scanning\n- display that vulnerability on the Group Dashboard and discover it is not dismissed.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://staging.gitlab.com/secure-team-test/security-reports\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFeedback created from Group Dashboard is not found in other places, and vice versa. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nFeedback created from Group Dashboard is also visible in other places, and vice versa. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nQuick demo: ![demo_bug_projects_fingerprints](/uploads/c4db5f9fcceb36fcef2d0e1e01636cb5/demo_bug_projects_fingerprints.mp4)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nAlign our `project_fingerprint` generation methods between ~frontend and ~backend. We might double check but the ~backend way is probably the one we want to keep, as it's based on more up to date discussions and knowledge.\n\n# Development Log\n\n## Status\n\n- [x] ~backend Extract vulnerability formatting logic for reuse in fingerprint migration https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14879\n- [ ] ~backend Migrate feedback for default branch occurrences to new fingerprint https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14848\n- [ ] ~backend Recreate old fingerprint matching for non-default branch occurrences on the backend\n- [ ] ~frontend Remove old fingerprint matching from frontend\n- [ ] ~backend Migrate feedback for non-default branch occurrences\n\n## Decisions\n\n* Move fingerprint matching for pipeline occurrences to the backend\n* Use a migration to update non-default branch feedback\n\nBoth decisions where made during a Zoom meeting.

self-approval restrictions by merge request author and commit author","description":"In GitLab 11.7 we shipped https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3845 which prevents commit authors from approving a merge request. This prevent users approving commits they themselves have authored and are being added to the target branch (commits already in the target branch are ignored).\n\nHowever, this overlooked the extent to which people commit to each others branches to fix small issues when doing a code review, and similarly applying a suggestion to a merge request also restricts who can approve the merge request.\n\nGitLab should be encouraging everyone to contribute to merge requests and support both behaviors.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis change in behavior is negatively impacting many customers and GitLab too.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSplit the current setting into:\n\n1. **Prevent approval of merge requests by merge request author** (enabled by default)\n2. **Prevent approval of merge requests by merge request committers** (disabled by default)\n\nNote that the wording has been inverted compared to the current feature.\n\nThe current setting which is now covers both of these should be used for setting 1 (merge request author) and the new value for setting 2 (merge request committers) should be off for everyone.

MergeRequestDiff is valid after creating it","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/ebf16ada856efb85424a98848c141f21e609886a we introduced a SHA validator to ensure that the data provided in merge request diffs when importing, was legit. But, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/58804 we realized that, even if the `MergeRequestDiff` validation fails, a default (\"valid\") record was added to a `MergeRequest` when it was created.\n\n\"Valid\" doesn't mean that the values are right, it only means that the validation process doesn't fail. For example, a \"valid\" `MergeRequestDiff` can be a record with `base_commit_sha`, `head_commit_sha`, `start_commit_sha`, or  `commits_count` set to `nil`. These attributes are basic and we use them in several places assuming they are not `nil`.\n\nWe should replace the `save` method in `save_git_content` with `save!`, and then handle that exception in all those places where it can be raised. Besides, we should check the importers, because if the `MergeRequestDiff` is not valid we should abort the creation of the `MergeRequest`. For example, in the Bitbucket importer we first create the `MergeRequest` but, if any exception is raised, the `MergeRequest` is not deleted.\n\n/cc @DouweM","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-14T08:59:15.422Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T03:04:20.033Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T03:04:20.020Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","DEPRECATED_import","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

a direct link to a release and release assets","description":"In GitLab Runner project we've recently started using the [Releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) feature (thank you @nolith!). It's something long-awaited by many users and I'm included in this group :wink: \n\nAt this moment I'm missing only one thing - \"direct\" links to the Releases and to their assets.\n\nFor me, the Releases page should be the main source of the release artifacts. For example, for GitLab Runner, when manual installation of the binary is required (MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD - for these OSes we officially support only manual installation of the binary), one needs to know the link to our S3 bucket and needs to know how we're organizing the releases inside of the bucket. What's worse, if we would decide that we like to move out from AWS S3 to GCP GCS (for any reason), all users scripting would be broken after implementing such change.\n\nWith Releases pages at GitLab, we have a possibility to have such _single source of truth_.\n\nSecond problem is that currently we can't link to a specific Release. So while it's easy to check information about the most recent ones, accessing the older ones may require a lot of scrolling and clicking the `next` button.\n\n## How it works currently\n\nCurrently the Releases are just listed at the `https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/project/releases` page. One can't access directly a specified release.\n\nCurrently, when preparing the Releases entry, one can specify a list of assets. Each asset is described with the name (printed on the Releases page), and the URL (where the asset can be found). On the releases page assets are next linked using the provided URL. This means the to download an asset one still needs to use the direct URL to a target storage. Which may change in the future, thus break installation scripts etc.\n\n## Proposed change\n\n1. ~~Add a `https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/project/releases/:release_id` page. While index page would still print all of them, if I'm interested in checking the details of GitLab Runner v11.0.0 release, I'd like to open a `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/releases/v11.0.0` page instead of scrolling and changing pages.~~ This has been split out into https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/32827\n\n1. Add a `filename` or rather `filepath` field for an asset description. The filename/filepath would be then used for linking the file. So, again using the GitLab Runner example:\n\n    - When adding an asset for `v11.9.0-rc2` release, define it as:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"name\": \"linux amd64\",\n          \"filepath\": \"binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64\",\n          \"url\": \"https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/v11.9.0-rc2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64\"\n        }\n        ```\n\n    - On the release/releases page, instead of linking the `linux amd64` file of `v11.9.0-rc2` release as `https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/v11.9.0-rc2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64` (the target URL where the file is stored) it should be linked as `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/releases/v11.9.0-rc2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64`. Notice that the `filepath` is added to the release direct page.\n\n    - To not force GitLab to proxy the download, it should just respond with HTTP 302 code pointing to `https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/v11.9.0-rc2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64` (the value of `url`). Every downloading tool that properly supports HTTP should handle this without problems.\n\nThanks to this, the Release is no longer coupled with the storage of it assets. One can start moving files from S3 to GCS, own servers or anything else, but as long as the URL on Releases page is pointing to it, the file will be still accessible from the very same URL: `https://gitlab.com/namespace/project/releases/:release_id/:filepath`.\n\nGitLab may be a main source of the source code repository, issues, community interactions via MRs. Let's make the Releases feature the main source of project releases, removing the tight bonding with used storage :wink:\n\n## UX Proposal\n\n[SEE DESIGNS OF RELEASE PAGE ENTRY](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/32827/designs/12.7-release_page-entry.png)\n\n## MR breakdown\n\n- add filepath column to release_links\n- validations for filepath column\n- routing and controller changes for redirect\n- documentation\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-13T17:46:04.182Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T22:24:38.323Z","closed_at":"2020-03-20T22:27:26.187Z","closed_by":{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Deliverable","Release::P1","UX","UX scorecard-rec","[deprecated] 🍎","backend","cicd::active","devops::release","direction","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::release","missed-deliverable","missed:12.8","missed:12.9","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":3079878,"username":"rayana","name":"Rayana Verissimo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3079878/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rayana"},{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"}],"author":{"id":215818,"username":"tmaczukin","name":"Tomasz Maczukin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a9a99b9665ab7eda2cd7bffd54b1836?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmaczukin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3079878,"username":"rayana","name":"Rayana Verissimo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3079878/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rayana"},"user_notes_count":48,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/27300","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/27300","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/27300/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/27300/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#27300","relative":"#27300","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#27300"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2202,"epic":{"id":15021,"iid":2202,"title":"Use `.gitlab-ci.yml` for  Release generation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2202","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
