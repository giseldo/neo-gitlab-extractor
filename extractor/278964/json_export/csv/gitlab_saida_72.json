The toolbar icon will create a new code block at the cursor's current position or from any selected text. The toolbar icon should reflect the state of the currently selected span of content. If the content is mixed (for example, the selected characters contain some code block content and some regular text) then we should indicate the inactive state. \n\n## Details\n\nExtensions to the Content Editor require a few specific details: \n\n|  |  |\n|---|---|\n| Input Rule | ``` |\n| Paste Rule | [paste_rule] |\n| Toolbar Button | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/blob/main/sprite_icons/doc-code.svg |\n| Keyboard Shortcut | [shortcut] |\n| Instrumentation | [event_name] |\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### Available Tier\n\nThis feature, as with the content editor itself, is available on both SaaS and Self-managed **Free** tiers\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nAn event should be added to track creation of a new code block node through the UI. We aren't interested in tracking every instance of code blocks in existing content, but it would be great to know how often this extension is invoked through the editor, and whether it is done by using the toolbar, keyboard shortcut, or by typing directly into the editor. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

The OpenAPI spec could provide the target url or it could be assembled using the document location along with document content. The OpenAPI data varies among versions (2.0, 3.0.x) and it is optional. Additionally, the runner component should give priority to user configuration for specifying target url provided in env variable or CLI.\n\n[Example failing job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/benchmark-suite/java-spring-mvn-api-bench/-/jobs/1188795141)\n\n[Example OpenAPI v2 specification that triggers issue](/uploads/bf0b77000a73d743ba43b88c1421085b/openapi.json)\n\n#### Workaround\n\nA user can work around this issue by saving the OpenAPI specification and manually updating it to include a full URL.\n\n### Proposal \n1. [x] Update `GetBaseUrl` so that\n   1. [x] First tries to use  input from `ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl`. (It is previously populated with CLI or environment var value) \n   1. [x] For **OpenAPI v3**. It uses the collection `Servers` and tries to find the first valid Url. Remarks:\n        1. [x] Server collection is optional, if no server is provided then. It can fall back to input document Uri to get base Url.\n        1. [x] [`Server.Url`](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0#server-object) can be relative to the input document Uri.\n        1. [x] [`Server.Url`](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0#server-object) can use server variables.\n        1. [x] Input document Uri data can be used as a fallback when not enough data to built base Url. This as long as it is an HTTP(S) Uri.\n   1. [x] For **OpenApi v2** It should use:  `schemes` collection, `host` node, and `basePath` node. Remarks:\n        1. [x] `Schemes` is optional. If not provided, it should use the same as the input document Uri.\n        1. [x] `host` is optional. It is name or IP, and optionally port number. If not provided, it should use the same as the input document Uri. It does _not_ support [path templating](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v2.0#path-templating).\n        1. [x]  `basePath` is optional. If provided, must start with '/'. It does _not_ support [path templating](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v2.0#path-templating).\n        1. [x] Input document Uri data can be used as a fallback when not enough data to built base Url. This as long as it is an HTTP(S) Uri.\n    1. [x]  Input Uri might not always be an HTTP or HTTPS Uri. If input Uri is not HTTP(s), and not `BaseUrl` have been provided thru `ApplicationOptions`, and it was not possible to compute it based on specification content. Then an error should be thrown\n1. [X] Add tests\n    1. [X] Tests for different scenarios. \n        1. [X] OpenApiV3 Provide ApplicationBaseUrl (W), input is external uri(X), document uses uri(Y). Expect operation to use Base Uri(W)\n        1. [X] OpenApiV3 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document does not have servers. Expect: operation use  input Uri \n        1. [X] OpenApiV3 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is local file path, document have Servers using Absolute Uri. Expect: operation to use absolute Uri \n        1. [X] OpenApiV3 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document have Servers using relative Uri. Expect operations to use input uri as base Url.\n        1. [X] OpenApiV3 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document have Servers using relative Uri and using server variables. Expect: operations to use input as base url, and replace variables from server.url\n        1. [X] OpenApiV3 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input local file path, document does not have Servers. Expected: Expected: Exception because target cannot be computed.\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 Provide ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document has scheme,host. Expected operations to use BaseUrl\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document does not have host,scheme, or basePath. Expected: operations to use input url\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document has basePath, but does no have host,scheme. Expected. Use operation to use scheme,host from input uri and attach basePath\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document has scheme,host,basePath. Expected operations to use document scheme,host,basePath only.\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document does not have scheme, but has host(with port), basePath. Expected operations to use input uri scheme, and document host and port.\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is local file path, document does not have scheme,host,basePath. Expected: Exception because target cannot be computed.\n    1. [X] Tests based on reported errors\n        1. [X] OpenApiV2 No ApplicationOptions.BaseUrl, input is external uri, document does not have scheme, host(with port), basePath. Expected operations to use input uri scheme, and document host and port.\n        1.

tested:\n\nThe test must happen in an EE environment. \nWe'll need to figure a Security-Scanner which is available for CE and EE Users.\nSAST was the first to be available for everybody and I don't see this changing in the near future, so that would be a good pick.\n\nMake sure that on click on \"enable via Merge Request\" the site does redirect correctly to a new Merge Request page, without any errors. \n\nIf that test passes we ensure that nothing has gone wrong when managing the scanners between the tiers.\n\n\n### Implementation Plan\n- [ ] (add a new test in `ee/spec/features/projects/security/user_views_security_configuration_spec.rb` or a new test file next to it))\n- [ ] (load security EE version of security-config page)\n- [ ] (select `Configure via

It has a strong test suite for extensions, it fixes many bugs, and it provides a more consistent and stable API.\n- The Content Editor is in early stages and it has a low level of coupling to TipTap v1. These circumstances makes the upgrade cost cheaper than at a later stage. \n\n## How?\n\nThese are the tasks involved in the upgrade based on a Spike I ran today:\n\n- [ ] Add new package dependencies\n- [ ] Update Webpack cache group configuration to target the new tiptap dependencies instead of the old ones. \n- [ ] Update the Markdown Serializer to account for the naming changes in several TipTap extensions. \n- [ ] Update the Toolbar Button component to use the new `Editor` class API. \n\n## Other Notes\n\n- We can’t remove the old tiptap dependencies from the application because they are used by the feature that allows to copy HTML as Markdown in several parts of the application.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-21T21:54:37.597Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T07:06:38.868Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T23:27:52.822Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"}],"author":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alcántara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328652","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328652","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328652/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328652/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328652","relative":"#328652","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328652"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5643,"epic":{"id":229786,"iid":5643,"title":"Create:Editor -- 13.11 - 14.0 -- Add Content Editor on Wiki Page","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5643","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 14, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85694666,"iid":328641,"project_id":278964,"title":"Insert images in the Content Editor","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nIn order to support the full [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/), the Content Editor must be support rendering and editing all the elements of the standard implementation .\n\nHere, we are focused on inserting or uploading images.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to insert and upload images in the Content Editor.\n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate an extension for the Content Editor that supports inserting a new image.\n\n- An icon should be displayed in the toolbar.

authorization workflows with CI_JOB_TOKEN","description":"\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nThe CI_JOB_TOKEN CI/CD variable makes API calls more intuitive within CI/CD jobs, enabling advanced automation. For example, the token can be used with bot automation projects that run pipelines in other projects. The token is short-lived, but in an effort to make its usage even more secure we are adding a setting that lets you list the exact projects that can be accessed with your project's CI job token. If the token is used to try to access other projects, it will be denied access to the API. In the bot automation example, it gives you additional control over the exact projects your bot will have access to and an added layer of security when using the CI_JOB_TOKEN CI/CD variable. This setting is enabled by default for all new projects, and we strongly recommend enabling it in all your existing projects.  \n\n### Problem to solve  \n\nI need a secure way to enable a customer to authorize a bot to do work on their behalf without compromising all customers who use the bot. Many users leverage the CI_JOB_TOKEN to do this, although when a bot uses a ci_token to do things like auto-remediation (make an mr, merge it) it is able to leak/be compromised in such a way that one customer can maliciously grab information it leaks and then use the to get any other customer (who has authorized the bot) repo/code.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nBots should be able to use the CI_JOB_TOKEN without fear of leaking data or information.\n\n### Proposal \n\nIntroduce a mechanism (when enabled via project settings) that limits the use of CI_JOB_TOKEN to the project where it originated from. By default, with this setting on, the CI_JOB_TOKEN won't be used outside the project's scope. However, project maintainers/owners can add other projects to the CI_JOB_TOKEN scope. This way the token can be used across a list of selected projects. For example, to trigger multi-project pipelines\n\nIntroduce a section `Token access` in the projects settings where owners/maintainers can:\n\n* Introduce a setting toggle to limit job token access(a more secure behaviour)\n* To avoid breaking anything, this option will come unchecked for all existing projects\n* For new projects this setting should come checked so limiting access for job tokens(initially being limited to the native project) becomes the default behaviour\n* Users are allowed to add/remove projects for the CI_JOB_TOKEN scope\n\n| Design Proposal |\n| -------|\n|

distribute a data model. Similarly, partitioning only splits but doesnt distribute data.\n\nThe common problem is using the right split dimension for your application. There is a few questions associated with that:\n\n1. What is the \"right\" dimension to slice by?\n1. How do we validate a chosen dimension is the right one?\n1. How do we understand which parts of the application work nicely with a given split, and which parts wont?\n\nThis issue explains how we might approach answering these questions, in particular (3).\n\n### Data access patterns\n\nThe inherent problem partitioning/sharding solves is to improve data access. By choosing a certain split dimension, we optimize for accessing data by this dimension. At the same time, we typically need to expect data access that doesn't follow this dimension to significantly degrade - it's a good working assumption to think of this as \"unfeasible\", since queries would go across shards.\n\nWhat is a data access pattern?\n\nWe access data, database tables, with certain filter criteria. For example, we might be looking at the `issues` table and we're interested in issues for a certain project:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM issue WHERE project_id = ? \n```\n\nThe `project_id = ?` is a way to define an access pattern. It's \"lookup by project\". Similarily, we can have \"lookup by user\" with `WHERE author_id = ?` or similar.\n\nSlicing a data model (aka partitioning or sharding) picks a certain access pattern to optimize for. This is then called the \"sharding key\". Database queries, that have the sharding key as a filter - i.e. matching the data access pattern - benefit tremendously from the sharding approach. Other's - without the sharding key and hence a different access pattern - they don't.\n\nFor GitLab, we're basically interested in answering:\n\nGiven a sharding key, e.g. top-level namespaces, \n\n1. what queries can we expect to be GOOD, i.e. have a matching data access pattern\n1. what queries do we need to expect to be bad, i.e. use an incompatible access pattern\n\n### Making incompatible data access patterns compatible\n\nWe pick the top-level namespace as the sharding key now.\n\nLet's assume we have this query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM issue WHERE project_id = ? \n```\n\nUpon first sight, this qualifies as BAD - it doesn't have the sharding key. \n\nHowever, on second sight, we realize that we can easily infer the sharding key in our data model. That is because an issue is always associated with a project, which in turn is associated with a namespace and ultimately a top-level namespaces.\n\nIn this transitive nature, we can infer the sharding key for many queries and thereby move them into a GOOD state.\n\n### Query analysis on .com\n\nIdeally, we don't have BAD queries. We know that's not going to be the case though. In order to understand which parts are going to be problematic for us, we can do the following:\n\nOn GitLab.com, we keep track of the N most frequent queries we execute in a normalized fashion in `pg_stat_statements`. At any time, this allows us to retrieve a portion of queries we typically execute.\n\nWe can parse these queries (using `pg_query` gem or similar) to understand their structure.\n\nIf certain filters like `namespace_id = ?` are present, we can mark the query as GOOD. \n\nNext, we define a set of rules to reason about the transitive nature of data access patterns we described above. For  example, we can always mark a query as good if we have `project_id = ?` or `issues.id = ?` or `pipelines.id = ?` etc. This allows us to mark a large portion of - otherwise problematic - queries as GOOD.\n\nThe remaining part is BAD queries we need to be able to deal with if we pick this sharding key.\n\nThis is likely not an exact science - we might overlook some queries. We can see how many BAD queries are left after this analysis though and work on either finding solutions how to make them compatible or actually mark them BAD.\n\n### Is this actionable?\n\nI believe this is actionable right now on GitLab.com without actually changing anything in the data model. We can use the workload from `pg_stat_statements` and perform this as an offline analysis.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to instrument the ActiveRecord models in a way that allows to reason about the same issue. I haven't worked out the specifics here yet, but if we find a way here, we can even track those metrics (how many GOOD/BAD queries we have) in Prometheus.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-21T10:22:20.816Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:23:30.833Z","closed_at":"2021-05-05T13:42:08.208Z","closed_by":{"id":3944199,"username":"fzimmer","name":"Fabian Zimmer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3944199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fzimmer"},"labels":["database","devops::data_stores","group::pods","wg_database-scalability"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328521","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328521","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328521/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328521/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328521","relative":"#328521","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328521"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5941,"epic":{"id":265138,"iid":5941,"title":"Make the application shard-aware","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5941","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85633036,"iid":328520,"project_id":278964,"title":"Define a schema for shards (databases)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nShards are databases.

Add multiple databases\n1. Create new shard with top-level namespace\n1. Show a group from new shard\n1. Create a new sub-group in new shard\n1. Show a group's members\n1. ~~Create new project in new shard~~\n1. ~~Run a pipeline~~\n1. Investigate dynamically add new databases\n1. Report back\n\n## Findings\n\nSummary: Rails 6.1 is viable to be used for the horizontal sharding POC\n\n1. I was able to run migrations in a shard, show the group page for a group, create a sub-group and show the group page for a sub-group.\n1. It is possible to create multiple DB with a static configuration\n1. There are some hints that may help with creating a dynamic `config/database.yml` in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36560\n1. We can run migrations for each DB, see `bin/rails -T`, after you setup multiple DBs. `rails db:migrate` migrates DB migrations for all databases, which is nice.\n1. The main mechanism is setting up `connects_to(shard: ...)` on each model. You then use `connected_to(role: :reading, shard: :shard_one) { query }` to run a query. Note the `role` is required. While using `connected_to`, non sharded models are not affected, eg.\n\n    ```\n    gitlabhq_development=# select count(1) from users;\n     count \n    -------\n        98\n    gitlabhq_development_shard_one=# select count(1) from users;\n     count \n    -------\n         1\n    gitlabhq_development=# select count(1) from namespaces;\n     count \n    -------\n       107\n    gitlabhq_development_shard_one=# select count(1) from namespaces;\n     count \n    -------\n        10\n    \n    [2] pry(main)\u003e NamespaceShard.connected_to(role: :reading, shard: :shard_one) { puts Namespace.count; puts User.count }\n       (10.4ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"namespaces\" /*application:console,line:(pry):2:in `block in \u003cmain\u003e'*/\n    10\n       (2.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"users\" /*application:console,line:(pry):2:in `block in \u003cmain\u003e'*/\n    98\n    ```\n\n1. ~~More research is needed on how to setup `connects_to(shard: ...)` with dynamic shards.~~\n1. Rails Associations are not smart enough to know about shards. Here it's getting confused with the routes association.\n\n    ```\n    # Good\n    [8] pry(main)\u003e Group.with_route.sharded_find 2\n      Group Load (2.5ms)  SELECT \"namespaces\".* FROM \"namespaces\" WHERE \"namespaces\".\"type\" = 'Group' AND \"namespaces\".\"id\" = 2 LIMIT 1 /*application:console,line:/app/models/namespace.rb:138:in `block in get'*/\n      Route Load (0.6ms)  SELECT \"routes\".* FROM \"routes\" WHERE \"routes\".\"source_type\" = 'Namespace' AND \"routes\".\"source_id\" = 2 /*application:console,line:/app/models/namespace.rb:138:in `block in get'*/\n    =\u003e #\u003cGroup id:2 @lost-and-found\u003e\n    \n    # Bad, the only mitigation is to ensure unique IDs across shards\n    [9] pry(main)\u003e Group.sharded_find 2\n      Group Load (0.6ms)  SELECT \"namespaces\".* FROM \"namespaces\" WHERE \"namespaces\".\"type\" = 'Group' AND \"namespaces\".\"id\" = 2 LIMIT 1 /*application:console,line:/app/models/namespace.rb:138:in `block in get'*/\n      Route Load (1.0ms)  SELECT \"routes\".* FROM \"routes\" WHERE \"routes\".\"source_id\" = 2 AND \"routes\".\"source_type\" = 'Namespace' LIMIT 1 /*application:console,line:/app/models/concerns/routable.rb:103:in `full_path'*/\n    =\u003e #\u003cGroup id:2 @bethany_mccullough\u003e\n    ```\n\n1. Same problem but with parent association\n\n    ```\n     Group.new(parent_id: 2).parent.path\n      Namespace Load (0.7ms)  SELECT \"namespaces\".* FROM \"namespaces\" WHERE \"namespaces\".\"id\" = 2 LIMIT 1 /*application:console,line:(pry):12:in `\u003cmain\u003e'*/\n    =\u003e \"bethany_mccullough\"\n    ```\n\n1. The Rails logs does not really show which _shard_ a query is executed on. Potential ~Observability improvement here, to annotate with `ActiveRecord::Base.current_shard`\n1. `while_preventing_writes` (https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/8b83793549fed994bf0231aff444aa74648b3c35/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_handling.rb#L219) and also the `prevent_writes:` option looks useful too.\n1. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60088 for more detailed notes, and POC code\n1. I was able to dynamically construct a shard aware model using `ActiveRecord::Base.configurations.configs_for(env_name: Rails.env)`. This seems to work with 2 DBs (three tier), 1 'primary' DB (three tier), and 1 DB (two tier).\n1. This means if for any reason a record was created in a shard, but the shard was withdrawn from configuration, we will see errors like `No connection pool for 'NamespaceShard' found for the 'shard_one' shard.`.

That's a waste of time, and when deploying a new release of `gemnasium` this makes for extra context switching between issue page, MR page, and pipeline view, until the pipeline succeeds.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe unit test fails at [scanner/parser/nuget/nuget_test.go#L80](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.5/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget_test.go#L80) when comparing the dependencies extracted from [./fixtures/duplicates/packages.lock.json](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.6/scanner/parser/nuget/fixtures/duplicates/packages.lock.json) to the ones recorded in [./duplicates/dependencies.json](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.6/scanner/parser/nuget/expect/duplicates/dependencies.json).\n\nHere's an excerpt of the `package.lock.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \".NETCoreApp,Version=v5.0\": {\n      \"jive\": {\n        \"type\": \"Direct\",\n        \"requested\": \"[0.2.0, )\",\n        \"resolved\": \"0.1.0\"\n      },\n      \"Microsoft.ChakraCore\": {\n        \"type\": \"Direct\",\n        \"requested\": \"[1.12, )\",\n        \"resolved\": \"1.12\"\n      }\n    },\n    \".NETCoreApp,Version=v3.0\": {\n      \"jive\": {\n        \"type\": \"Direct\",\n        \"requested\": \"[0.1.0, )\",\n        \"resolved\": \"0.1.0\",\n        \"contentHash\": \"oPBGSgY7X2/CMnWGDVdCIDnvaQGXfZz+hnC2PmvjStqDz72ZwNbkPqXYo47QyGOfLYdsp1aieP+Km2KyZMDUSg==\"\n      },\n      \"Microsoft.ChakraCore\": {\n        \"type\": \"Direct\",\n        \"requested\": \"[1.11.18, )\",\n        \"resolved\": \"1.11.18\",\n        \"contentHash\": \"jPtaoN8ZaRcioMvl2aUMiqhmKVMxYYyR0UCCsQ1viKC9qoiqZGWtXufdOAm1U/IzULAtDmVBTdsSdDyt4ND81A==\"\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(This fixture might be updated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/197.)\n\nCurrently the parser either selects version `1.12` or version `1.11.18` of `Microsoft.ChakraCore` as a top-level dependency because it resolves dependency names to package names and versions using a map, and this map is built when iterating the \"targets\" and their dependencies in a non-deterministic way.\n\nLinks\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.6/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget.go#L75\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.6/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget.go#L86\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.6/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget.go#L95\n\nNOTE: This only affects the `dependencies` return by the NuGet parser, not the `packages`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTrigger pipelines for the [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) project until the `go test` job fails.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`go test` job fails because `TestNuget/Parse/duplicates/dependencies` fails because it either returns `Microsoft.ChakraCore` 1.11.18 or 1.12 as a top-level, when processing the `duplicates` fixtures\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`go test` always succeeds, and the NuGet lock file parser always returns both `Microsoft.ChakraCore` 1.11.18 and 1.12 as top-level dependencies\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/jobs/1303773084\n\n```\n=== RUN

fixes\n\n- workaround: change the way the NuGet lock file parser build the `dependencies`, and make it deterministic when processing a lock file that has multiple targets with similar or identical packages\n- workaround: only keep 1 target defined in the lock file, and ignore others; this ensures data consistent and simplify the implementation, but vulnerabilities might not be reported if the target being scanned isn't the one used in production\n- workaround: generate 1 dependency graph per target, and merge them before returning `packages` and `dependencies`; merging dependency graphs isn't trivial though because they might end sharing the very same node, because of the way duplicates are removed from the returned `packages`\n- true fix: return 1 dependency graph per target; this is a large change impacting everything from the analyzer to the report format to the GitLab backend and frontend","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-20T17:27:52.838Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:57:23.397Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T08:24:14.805Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien

NOTE\n\nYou can use this container by replacing the `image` `name` in your configuration yml\n\n```\ngemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:\n  image:\n    name: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9\n```\n\nHowever this is a temporary work around, we will announce [deprecation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334060) - and [removal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334061) will be swiftly after (as short as 1 release)\n\nYOU MUST KEEP A WATCH ON THE DEPRECATION ISSUE OR THE IMAGE MAY GO AWAY WITHOUT YOU BEING PREPARED\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThere are users of python 3.7 and 3.9 who can not use dependency scanning today - and can not wait for the long term solution.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nFollow instructions and then be able to use dependency scanning temporarily\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nCreate a one off image using 3.9 (and have a 3.7 user test if it resolves their issue) clearly indicate it is a temporary fix and have it named and tagged as such. All people using it should be collected in an issue (a private one?) to be informed when the correct feature is released.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. change the [Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/v2.18.1/Dockerfile#L13) so that the version referenced in the base image becomes a Docker build argument named `PYTHON_VERSION`\n\n   See [WIP: Build separate Python 3.9 image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/101) for PoC\n\n1. Duplicate [existing tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/07928be/.gitlab-ci.yml#L39-101), changing the target image to check `python-3.9`\n\n   1. Fix broken [python-3.9-ds-excluded-paths-qa](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/-/pipelines/300091295) test\n   1. Fix broken [python-3.9-pip-qa](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pip/-/pipelines/300091302) test\n\n1. Add build job similar to [`build tmp image`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/analyzer.yml#L60), and that sets PYTHON_VERSION (Docker build argument) and TMP_IMAGE (to avoid collision)\n\n   See [Add build tmp python image job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/commit/be813316fc585f66cab058015db9909f7963efce) for details\n\n1. Add \"tag jobs\" to publish the temporary images\n1. Test new `python-3.9` image with:\n   - a customer who uses python 3.9\n   - a customer who uses python 3.7\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

We display a `triggered` label based on\n`job.try(:trigger_request)`\n\n2. We display a `manual` label based on \n`job.action?`\n\nWe actually can display this in a hacky not preferred way right now by determining if the job is manual by diving into the `detailedStatus`. But it's preferable to have a boolean. \n\nCheck out https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/projects/ci/builds/_build.html.haml#L48-55 block to get a good idea of the implementation. We have `allowFailure` in GraphQL already which is nice :smile_cat: \n\n### For tag\n\nCurrently we display a label icon if the job is from a tag and a fork icon if not. See code https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/projects/ci/builds/_build.html.haml#L25\n\nWe need a way in GraphQL to do this logic.

Also, I was able to bypass CSP and gain full javascript execution under gitlab.com context.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce  \n1. Create a **Mock API** that response this payload ![payload.json]([REDACTED]) when there are requests to path ```/rest/api/2/issue/POC?expand=renderedFields```.  You can use https://beeceptor.com/ like my POC video.\n\n2. In a GitLab project that has premium / ultimate license , go to **Settings -\u003e Integrations -\u003e Jira**:  \n- Tick active at the **Enable integration** section  \n- Input any URL at **Web URL** field  \n- Input the mock API created in Step 1 to the **Jira API URL** field  \n- Click **Save changes**\n\n3. Now go to https://gitlab.com/[YOUR_ORGANIZATION]/[YOUR_PROJECT]/-/integrations/jira/issues/POC  and you will see a popup.\n\n#####  Impact  \nStored-XSS allow attackers to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims at client side. And since the JIRA issue detail pages can be made public, this impact a considerable number of GitLab users and visitors.\n\n#####  Examples\n\n- [REDACTED] (tested in Chrome and Firefox)\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitLab doesn't sanitize the *key* field in the JSON response from Jira API so it leads to stored XSS at the Jira issue detail pages.\n\n[REDACTED]\n#####  POC Video\n\n![REDACTED]\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGitLab should sanitize *key* field in the JSON response from Jira API before output to browser.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nStored-XSS allow attackers to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims at client side. And since the JIRA issue detail pages can be made public, this impact a considerable number of GitLab users and visitors.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n[REDACTED]\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-20T10:58:55.331Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:43:56.045Z","closed_at":"2021-08-31T18:26:40.329Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-79","devops::manage","frontend","group::integrations","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-06-19","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328389","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328389","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328389/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328389/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328389","relative":"#328389","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328389"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85557148,"iid":328385,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create Card with Variants for Security Config Page","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.

These jobs shouldn't be getting enqueued if any are already enqueued with the same job arguments: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/development/sidekiq_style_guide.md#deduplication. So the problem should be somewhat limited already.\n\n#### Proposal: Deduplicate until executed\n\nBut actually this is a perfect case for changing this worker from the default job deduplication strategy (`:until_executing`) to instead use `:until_executed`. This will throw out jobs if another one with duplicate args is currently running. I think we could even remove the exclusive lease code. This should help a bit. I'll open an issue.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n(Referring to `Geo::RepositoryVerification::Primary::ShardWorker`)\n\nThere is no reason to schedule one of these workers if one with the same args is already running.

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-19T23:53:57.374Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T07:09:33.642Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T15:32:47.838Z","closed_by":{"id":5427309,"username":"ssarka","name":"Saikat Sarkar","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/097feebc1eb82b858a9046fe9b6d9176?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ssarka"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Deliverable","GitLab Free","backend","devops::secure","direction","documentation","group::static analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":3658061,"username":"rdickenson","name":"Russell Dickenson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3658061/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdickenson"},{"id":5057937,"username":"dsearles","name":"Daniel Paul Searles","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5057937/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dsearles"},{"id":5211947,"username":"zrice","name":"Zach Rice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5211947/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zrice"},{"id":5427309,"username":"ssarka","name":"Saikat Sarkar","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/097feebc1eb82b858a9046fe9b6d9176?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ssarka"}],"author":{"id":3652047,"username":"twoodham","name":"Thomas Woodham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3652047/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/twoodham"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3658061,"username":"rdickenson","name":"Russell Dickenson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3658061/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdickenson"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328301","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":10,"completed_count":4},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 10 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328301","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328301/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328301/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328301","relative":"#328301","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328301"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5408,"epic":{"id":205427,"iid":5408,"title":"14.0 removals for Static Analysis","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5408","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":85497791,"iid":328297,"project_id":278964,"title":"Declare Content Editor  toolbar buttons as a constant object","description":"The following discussion from !59303 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @himkp started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59303#note_555270805): \n\n    \u003e **Suggestion**: I think we can avoid the repetition here by creating a constants object that defines all the button types and iterating over them in the template using `v-for`.

pipeline code quality report to GraphQL","description":"## Release notes\n\nIt is possible for you to run linters and scanners in addition to the one included with the GitLab Code Quality Template. If you generate that data in another job though only the last CodeQuality report will be used by GitLab's Code Quality features so you are missing out on issues detected by all the scans.\n\nNow the Full Code Quality report supports reading multiple reports and displaying data from all of them. This means you can get a better view of quality issues in your code and fix them earlier in the development process.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn order to move forward quickly with future iterations of the pipeline code quality report tab, it is important that we lay a proper foundation by moving this report to GraphQL.\n\n## Improvements\n\n- Allow for quicker iterations between ~frontend and ~backend \n- Take advantage of the caching we already have on that page from other components using GraphQL\n\n## Risks\n\nWe could break the page temporarily. However, we can mitigate this possibility by using a feature flag to enable/disable this migration.\n\n## Involved components\n\n~frontend \n\n- [ ]

[ ] [everything in the `ee/app/assets/javascripts/codequality_report` folder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/codequality_report)\n- [ ] Implement ~feature using new `GraphQL API`\n- [ ] Remove custom logic for sorting degradations\n- [ ] Add a note to [the code quality report documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html#code-quality-reports) about supporting multiple reports as of this release version.\n\n~backend\n###

via RSS feed. This is very similar to #962604.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. As victim, create a private project with at least one file.\n\n    ![create_private_project.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0f4fb524-e8eb-41d8-9fa3-f15e4b42e36d/create_private_project.png)\n\n2. Invite attacker user with Developer role.\n\n    ![invited_developer.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0642c2f9-3979-4a71-be1d-8fbf14e75214/invited_developer.png)\n\n3. As attacker, create a MR.\n\n    ![random_change_by_attacker.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/f3c4764c-7534-4b1c-a101-215585484010/random_change_by_attacker.png)\n\n    ![test_mr_by_attacker.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/9ae540d1-041a-4484-b17a-2e2d88c5a5b9/test_mr_by_attacker.png)\n\n4. As victim, demote the attacker user to Guest role.\n\n    ![demoted_to_guest.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/d96477f1-eadf-4a15-82b5-1386cfe9ebe7/demoted_to_guest.png)\n\n5. As victim, add a random activity to the MR. For simplicity, just post a comment and then approve the MR.\n\n    ![admin_comments_and_approves_after_demoting.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7e48ad6b-fca0-4327-b53f-ea9ef94ca6ea/admin_comments_and_approves_after_demoting.png)\n\n5. As attacker, browse to the RSS feed of the project (`https://gitlab.com/victimuser/projectname.atom`).  \n6. Verify you can see the MR is approved and the comment contents.\n\n    ![guest_can_see_activity_via_rss_feed.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/5d169575-1d6a-4348-8501-9dd3673760b9/guest_can_see_activity_via_rss_feed.png)\n\n7.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nEnsure test coverage in unit/integration tests, no end-to-end test is required.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-19T14:33:39.028Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T13:26:03.719Z","closed_at":"2021-11-03T12:11:01.374Z","closed_by":{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","GitLab Core","Next Up","Technical Writing","backend","backend complete","boards","devops::plan","direction","documentation","frontend","group::project management","missed:13.12","missed:13.9","missed:14.4","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","tw-weight::3","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"}],"author":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328240","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328240","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328240/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328240/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328240","relative":"#328240","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328240"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6258,"epic":{"id":297855,"iid":6258,"title":"Work Items - Work Items exist and track","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6258","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
