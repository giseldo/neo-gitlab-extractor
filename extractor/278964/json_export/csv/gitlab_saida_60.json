For future features using this need of \"download and cache from an external url\" will need to implement the following:\n\n### Option 1: Using a response header\n\n  * the rails that returns the new response header\n  * the `/authorize` rails endpoint\n  * the upload rails endpoint\n\n### Option 2: Using a route handler\n  * the `/authorize` rails endpoint\n  * the upload rails endpoint\n  * the new route in workhorse router\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nThe items below only describes the route handler approach, the response header approach has not been broken out. Both approaches should be evaluated before choosing the best one to solve this problem. \n\n* [ ] Add the [blob route](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e411f3782b55e9689dc3fdf5540dbc5f9f4a9e1f/config/routes/group.rb#L147) to the upstream routes to be intercepted.\n* [ ] Update the response to the `/authorize` request to accept a json payload with fields (URL and token) for requesting an image from an external registry.\n  * [ ] Use the returned URL and token to request the blob and upload it to the configured file storage system.\n  * [ ] Allow workhorse to then follow the existing logic to return the file metadata back to rails to complete the originally received request to download the blob.\n  * [ ] Return the blob file","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-08T19:34:41.565Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T07:00:47.254Z","closed_at":"2021-10-20T05:04:34.541Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor

[X] Update scanner to collect data\n   1. [X] Update `SessionStatus` class. (Counters can accessed using `this._jobInstance.Job.Status`)\n      1. [X] Add property `PassiveCheckCount` to `SessionStatus`  class.\n      1. [X] Add property `ActiveCheckCount` to `SessionStatus`  class\n      1. [X] Add property `MutationalCheckCount` to `SessionStatus`  class.\n   1. [X] Update counters into `WebCheckStrategy`\n      1. [X] Increase `ActiveCheckCount` in `StartActiveCheck` method before exiting.\n      1. [X] Increase `PassiveCheckCount` in `EvaluatePassiveChecks` into the check loop. After check and assertions have been performed.\n      1. [X] Increase `MutationalCheckCount` in `EvaluateScope`. \n      ```csharp\n            // Identify Mutation checks to be run\n\t\t\tvar checks = exchange.RouteWithChecks.Checks\n\t\t\t\t.OfType\u003cIMutationCheck\u003e()\n\t\t\t\t.Where(x =\u003e x.BaseConfiguration.IsEnabled \u0026\u0026 x.Scope == scope);\n\t\t\tforeach (var check in checks)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tcontext.Parameter = parameter;\n\t\t\t\tvar mutation = check.MutationCheck(context);\n\t\t\t\tif (mutation.Applicable)\n\t\t\t\t{\n                    // ***** INCREASE COUNT HERE *****\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (var j = 0; j \u003c mutation.Count; j++)\n      ```\n      **NOTE** There are two locations where `check.MutationCheck` is invoked. Only increase counter on new checks, skip retry invocation.\n1. [X]  Update `worker-entry` \n   1. [X] Ensure counters are delivered thru Web API\n   1. [X] Update output\n      1. [X] Remove `2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: Finished testing. Performed a total of 1 requests.`\n      1. [X] Remove `2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: Testing completed successfully, 1 issues detected.`\n      1. [X] Add sections using values from WebAPI\n      ```log\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: --[ Finished testing ]-------------------------\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: Testing completed successfully\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security:\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security:  * Performed total of 1 API requests.\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security:  * Performed total of 1 security checks.\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security:    - Active checks....: 1\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security:    - Passive checks...: 1\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security:  * Detected XX vulnerabilities.\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: ------------------------------------------------\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: \n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: Testing completed successfully\n      2021-11-04 00:00:00 [INF] API Security: \n      ```\n   1.

Context\n\nWith virtual scrolling, the browser's find function (`CMD+F`) is not able to find all of the possible matches since virtual scrolling “removes” content from the DOM. Because of this, it's not obvious that the find function is not working correctly — it may return an incorrect number of matches. The only way to be sure is to manually scroll through the diffs while re-checking the browser's find function.\n\nIn summary, with virtual scrolling, users won't know if the browser's find function is working correctly or not, but it's likely that they will accept the find results because they don't have any reasons to suspect that it's misbehaving. Instrumenting the usage of this find function will help us understand the urgency of [Address browser find function with virtual scrolling on MRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331924).\n\nWe want to track both **users** and **counts**. Users can help understand the potential reach (e.g. X users have used this last month), and counts can help understand the potential impact (e.g. on average, users use this X times per day).\n\n## Proposal\n\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/a/6680403 for possible ways to track the keyboard shortcuts that trigger browser's find function.\n\nNote: be mindful of cross-platform compatibility (CMD vs CTRL, etc.).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-07T14:02:27.964Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T07:01:42.317Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T10:02:29.454Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","instrumentation","merge requests","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335416","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/335416","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/335416/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/335416/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#335416","relative":"#335416","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#335416"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5952,"epic":{"id":266300,"iid":5952,"title":":rocket: Diffs virtual scrolling","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5952","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89906435,"iid":335413,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Github Importer documentation","description":"Both user (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html) and developer (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/github_importer.html) Github Importer documentation are currently outdated with the most recent works in fixes/improve it.\n\nSome thing to update in the documentation:\n- [x] Include the recently added `ImportPullRequestsMergedByWorker` and `Stage::ImportPullRequestsReviewsWorker`;

info\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/serializers/vulnerabilities/finding_entity.rb seems to contain all fields mentioned above. So this file can be used to double check the missing fields. \n\n**If possible, make sure to return the same structure as used in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/helpers/vulnerabilities_helper.rb#L10. This will help us reuse the same logic we have for the vulnerability details page in the ~frontend.**\n\n## Implementation Plan \n\n1. Create the following new `GraphQL` types, which are based on the findings from [Technical Spike: Define GraphQL schema to support migration for Vulnerability Details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343312#findings):\n\n   ```graphql\n   type VulnerabilityEvidence {\n     summary: String\n     supportingMessages: [VulnerabilityEvidenceSupportingMessage]\n     source: VulnerabilityEvidenceSource\n     request: [VulnerabilityRequest!]\n     response: [VulnerabilityResponse!]\n   }\n   \n   type VulnerabilityEvidenceSupportingMessage {\n     name: String!\n     request: [VulnerabilityRequest]\n     response: [VulnerabilityResponse]\n   }\n   \n   type VulnerabilityEvidenceSource {\n     id: String!\n     name: String!\n     url: String\n   }\n   \n   type VulnerabilityRequestResponseHeader {\n     name: String\n     value: String\n   }\n   \n   type VulnerabilityRequest {\n     body: String\n     method: String!\n     url: String!\n     headers: [VulnerabilityRequestResponseHeader!]\n   }\n   \n   type VulnerabilityResponse {\n     body: String\n     statusCode: String!\n     reasonPhrase: String!\n     headers: [VulnerabilityRequestResponseHeader!]\n   }\n   \n   type VulnerabilityAsset {\n     type: String!\n     name: String!\n     url: String!\n   }\n   \n   # Check ee/lib/ee/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/validators/schemas/coverage-fuzzing-report-format.json\n   # for more details\n   type VulnerabilityLocationCoverageFuzzing {\n     crashType: String\n     crashAddress: String\n     stacktraceSnippet: String\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. Extend [`PipelineSecurityReportFindingType`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/554b228c985/ee/app/graphql/types/pipeline_security_report_finding_type.rb#L5-5) to add the following fields, based on the new types added in step `1.`:\n\n   ```graphql\n    type SecurityReportFinding\n    {\n      assets: [VulnerabilityAsset]\n      evidence: VulnerabilityEvidence\n      title: String #

Enable the `Feature.enable(:repository_push_audit_event)` feature flag.\n2. Clear the `current_sign_in_ip` for a user\n3. Using that user's account, push a change (tested with ssh push only) to a repository\n4. The `RepositoryPushAuditEventWorker` will fail with the following backtrace (`14.0.3`)\n\n```\n  \"error_message\": \"PG::InvalidTextRepresentation: ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type inet: \\\"\\\"\\nLINE 2:         VALUES (1, 'jayo', 9, 'Project', '', '2021-07-06 21:...\\n                                                 ^\\n\",\n  \"error_class\": \"ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid\",\n  \"error_backtrace\": [\n    \"lib/gitlab/database.rb:235:in `bulk_insert'\",\n    \"ee/app/services/audit_events/bulk_insert_service.rb:21:in `block in execute'\",\n    \"ee/app/services/audit_events/bulk_insert_service.rb:20:in `execute'\",\n    \"ee/app/workers/repository_push_audit_event_worker.rb:28:in `perform'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/duplicate_jobs/strategies/until_executing.rb:16:in `perform'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/duplicate_jobs/duplicate_job.rb:41:in `perform'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/duplicate_jobs/server.rb:8:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/worker_context.rb:9:in `wrap_in_optional_context'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/worker_context/server.rb:17:in `block in call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/application_context.rb:74:in `block in use'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/application_context.rb:74:in `use'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/application_context.rb:27:in `with_context'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/worker_context/server.rb:15:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_status/server_middleware.rb:7:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_versioning/middleware.rb:9:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/admin_mode/server.rb:14:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/instrumentation_logger.rb:9:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/batch_loader.rb:7:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/extra_done_log_metadata.rb:7:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/request_store_middleware.rb:10:in `block in call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/with_request_store.rb:17:in `enabling_request_store'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/with_request_store.rb:10:in `with_request_store'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/request_store_middleware.rb:9:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/server_metrics.rb:29:in `block in call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/server_metrics.rb:52:in `block in instrument'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/metrics/background_transaction.rb:30:in `run'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/server_metrics.rb:52:in `instrument'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/server_metrics.rb:28:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/monitor.rb:8:in `block in call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_daemon/monitor.rb:49:in `within_job'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/monitor.rb:7:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/size_limiter/server.rb:13:in `call'\",\n    \"lib/gitlab/sidekiq_logging/structured_logger.rb:19:in `call'\"\n  ],\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\n1.

Today they do this by manually entering approval settings for individual branches. This is very time consuming and error prone, especially if a project has dozens of protected branches or when the protected branches changes.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nAllow users to define an approval rule they would like to use for all protected branches in a project. Add a new option, `All protected branches`, to merge request approval rules at the _project level_. \n\nWhile also replacing `Any eligible user` → `All eligible users` and `Any branch` → `All branches` to keep consistent ~\"UI text\" \n\nAutomatically apply this approval setting to any branches that become protected, even if they were not originally.\n\n### Implementation Proposal\n\n* Add a new database column `applies_to_all_protected_branches:boolean` (or perhaps something less... verbose)\n* Alter the logic of `def applies_to_branch?(branch)` to return `true` if `applies_to_all_protected_branches` is true _and_ `branch` is a protected branch of the appropriate project. \n* Add the new parameter to the `/api/v4/projects/23/approval_settings/rules` REST endpoint to allow for read/write of the new parameter.\n* Update REST and GraphQL APIs to output a dynamic list of all protected branches in the `protected_branches` key in API responses.\n* Should be implemented behind a ~\"feature flag\" \n\n#### Scenario illustration\n\nA merge request approval rule \"Villains\" targets `All protected branches`\n\n![Branch_update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/45652423dedd312aa9d51324b7cadd03/Branch_update.png)\n\n[Open Figma

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

To efficiently query this table by the stage (start_event_identifier, end_event_identifier), the table will contain the `stage_hash_id` column.\n\nThe stages are stored in two tables:\n\n- Group level stages: `analytics_cycle_analytics_group_stages`\n- Project level stages: `analytics_cycle_analytics_project_stages` (not in use yet)\n\n**Problem**\n\nWithin a group, you can have several stages with the same start and end event configuration:\n\n- In different value streams\n- In different subgroups\n- In projects\n\nIf we collect the data for these stages, we'll store the same `issues` and `merge_requests` data several times.\n\n**Solution**\n\nHash each stage using the following attributes:\n\n```\n[start_event_identifier, end_event_identifier]\n```\n\nFor label based events:\n\n```\n[start_event_identifier, start_event_label_id, end_event_identifier, end_event_label_id]\n```\n\n- Add the `stage_hash` method to `Analytics::CycleAnalytics::GroupStage` and `Analytics::CycleAnalytics::ProjectStage` which returns a SHA1 hash based on the rules above.\n- Create a new table called `analytics_cycle_analytics_stage_hashes(id: bigint, hash: binary)`\n- In a `before_save` hook in the `Analytics::CycleAnalytics::GroupStage` and `Analytics::CycleAnalytics::ProjectStage` models, insert a new `analytics_cycle_analytics_stage_hashes` value (if it does not exist).\n- Now we have a stable `id` value (`stage_hash_id`) which we can use in the new VSA table(s).\n\nExample:\n\n```ruby\nproject = Project.last\n\ngroup_hash = Analytics::CycleAnalytics::GroupStage.new(group: project.group, end_event_identifier: 'merge_request_created', start_event_identifier: 'merge_request_merged').stage_hash\n\nproject_hash = Analytics::CycleAnalytics::GroupStage.new(project: project, end_event_identifier: 'merge_request_created', start_event_identifier: 'merge_request_merged').stage_hash\n\n\n# should be true:\n\nputs group_hash == project_hash\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-06T14:20:05.436Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T18:42:24.345Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T18:42:24.300Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam

The registry will then read the information within those tokens and decide if a new repository should use the database or not.\n\n:warning: This requires changes in both Rails and Container Registry. This issue will group both.\n\n## Technical Background\n\n### Auth Tokens\n\nWe'll only list the basics here. Please see the auth [spec](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/) and [flow](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs-gitlab/auth-request-flow.md) if looking for additional details.\n\n* Every request against the GitLab Container Registry needs to have a valid JWT token. This is true for both read and write requests, against public or private repositories;\n* JWT tokens are emitted and signed by Rails, obtained by clients, and embedded in the request header. The registry decodes and validates the token to ensure its authenticity and that the user has the required permissions to perform the request.\n\nA token can be obtained as follows:\n\n```shell\nhttp -a $USERNAME:$PASSWORD https://$GITLAB_ADDRESS/jwt/auth \\\n    client_id==\"docker\" \\\n    service==\"container_registry\" \\\n    scope==\"repository:$REPO_PATH:pull,push,delete\n```\n\n#### Format\n\nHere's a sample JWT token:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"access\": [\n    {\n      \"actions\": [\n        \"pull\",\n        \"push\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"gitlab-org/gitlab-test\",\n      \"type\": \"repository\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"aud\": \"container_registry\",\n  \"exp\": 1623679323,\n  \"iat\": 1623675723,\n  \"iss\": \"gitlab-issuer\",\n  \"jti\": \"71fb41a4-6e42-4967-b584-914ea969b225\",\n  \"nbf\": 1623675718,\n  \"sub\": \"root\"\n}\n```\n\nFor most cases, `access` will only have one element, as most requests only target one repository. [Cross-repository blob mount](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/c8a624aaa9ea2a4ab60744dd986e959c01232be9/docs/spec/api.md#cross-repository-blob-mount) requests are the exception, as we always have two repositories, a source (for which a user needs `pull` permissions) and a target (for which a user needs `pull` and `push` permissions). In these cases, a token will look as follows:\n\n```json-doc\n{\n  \"access\": [\n    {\n      \"actions\": [\n        \"pull\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"source-repo\",\n      \"type\": \"repository\"\n    }\n    {\n      \"actions\": [\n        \"pull\",\n        \"push\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"target-repo\",\n      \"type\": \"repository\"\n    }\n  ],\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Rails Feature Flags (FFs)\n\nSee the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/index.html).\n\n## Requirements\n\nWe need a way to limit the number of **new** repositories that will be handled through the new code path (and thus registered in the metadata DB and have their blobs stored in the new bucket prefix) to support Phase 1 of the [gradual migration plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/374), making sure that:\n\n* We can gradually increase the number of repositories that *may* be eligible (in case they are considered *new* on the registry side) to follow through new code path;\n* We can pick a few specific repositories to start with, only then expanding to a percentage-based rollout;\n* We can exclude all repositories from specific top-level groups until a later date, such as those from VIP customers, making sure they cannot be affected by early bugs. These will then be allowed gradually, one by one (or in small batches).\n\n## Solution\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  participant C as Client\n  participant G as GitLab Rails\n  participant R as GitLab Container Registry\n  C-\u003e\u003eG: GET /jwt/auth?repository:\u003crepo\u003e:\u003cactions\u003e\u0026...\n  G-\u003e\u003eG: If \u003cactions\u003e includes `push`, does \u003crepo\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ebelong to an eligible top-level Group and Project?\n  opt Yes\n  \tG-\u003e\u003eG: Set custom `access[name=\u003crepo\u003e].migration_eligible = true`\u003cbr/\u003eflag on the token's body\n  end\n  G-\u003e\u003eC: 200 OK\u003cbr/\u003e{\"token\": \"w2a4...\"}\n  C-\u003e\u003eR: POST/PUT/PATCH /v2/\u003crepo\u003e/...\u003cbr/\u003eAuthorization: Bearer w2a4...\n  R-\u003e\u003eR: Is \u003crepo\u003e new\u003cbr/\u003eAND\u003cbr/\u003edoes `migration_eligible` equals `true`?\n  alt Yes\n    R-\u003e\u003eR: Process through new code path\n  else No\n    R-\u003e\u003eR: Process through old code path\n  end\n  R-\u003e\u003eC: 200 OK\n```\n\nStep **(2)** in the diagram above, most precisely the Group/Project validations, is where the Rails FFs come into play. This is a replacement for the registry-side validations initially planned and described in the [migration plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/374#gradual-rollout).\n\n### Feature Flags\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Validate eligibility] --\u003e B{Is the corresponding\u003cbr/\u003etop-level Group denied?};\n    B -- \"Yes\" --\u003e C[Emit unmodified token]\n    B -- \"No\" --\u003e D{Is the corresponding\u003cbr/\u003eProject allowed?}\n    D -- \"Yes\" --\u003e E[Emit modified token]\n    D -- \"No\" --\u003e C\n```\n\nBelow is a description of each FF.\n\n#### `container_registry_migration_phase1`\n\nThis is a simple *boolean* FF to act as a global gate. In case it's *off* (by default), Rails behaves as it does today - it does not validate the repository scope and/or mess with the JWT token. In case it's *on*, it validates the eligibility of the repository based on the following FFs and modifies the token accordingly.\n\nWe'll use this FF to start the Phase 1 migration without changing any source code or registry configurations.\n\n#### `container_registry_migration_phase1_allow`\n\nThis FF acts as an allow list for Rails **projects**. When validating `\u003crepo\u003e`, we check `Feature.enabled?(:container_registry_migration_phase1_allow, repo.project)`.\n\nWe'll start with some specific repositories created for testing, and then we'll allow `gitlab-org/*` repositories, gradually. Once we're done with the initial phase, we can start a \"global\" percentage-based rollout using this same FF.\n\nIt's important to note that this FF applies to GitLab projects, not container repositories. Given that a project might have multiple container repositories, a 1% here does not equal 1% of the container repositories. This is not necessarily a problem, just something to keep in mind as we increase the scope.\n\n#### `container_registry_migration_phase1_deny`\n\nThis FF acts as a deny list for Rails **groups**/**namespaces**. When validating `\u003crepo\u003e`, we check `Feature.disabled?(:container_registry_migration_phase1_deny, repo.project.root_ancestor)`. Note that here we do `Feature.disabled?` and not `Feature.enabled?`. All groups are eligible by default. We can exclude a specific group by enabling this FF for it.\n\nThis allows us to exclude specific top-level groups/namespaces from the process so that they are never marked as eligible because of the `_allow` FF.

guests to see tag names associated with releases","description":"Currently, we treat `\"tag names\"` associated with releases as `source code` and don't allow guests to see them.\n\nBut:\n1. we use the tag name as `ID` for releases, so without it, guests won't be able to see the release page.\n1. we use tag name as the default \"name\" for the release, so guest will see releases called \"release-ID\" (which is a strange user experience)\n1. we even consider [removing some features for guest users to preserve this security feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216617)\n1. all these workarounds require a lot of time of our development team to support\n\nWe can solve of this by relaxing security requirements a little and allowing users to see tag name for releases. (Note that all tag related information like commit SHA will still be unavailable)\n\nThe end result is\n\n1. Guests see proper names of releases (in case name is empty we show tag as name)\n1.

In this approach, I've used a gantt chart to display the work, estimates* and dependencies. The goal with this approach is to defer the discussion about the number of people needed until we come to a shared vision of the work involved. Caveat: These are not hard and fast delivery estimates. These are best guesses coming from epic due dates and feedback gathered so far.\n\nNote: More work may be discovered via [Decomposition: Identify other teams and features impacted by decomposing the database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335061).\n\n## Feedback\nWhat we're looking for in this discussion is for parallel efforts to start. For example, using the [skateboard to car](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#iteration) iteration example, if we can simultaneously create the wheels while also shaping the skate deck by staffing two skateboard experts we can deliver the skateboard faster.\n\nAnyone can contribute to the Gantt chart. If we've missed a work track, please add with your best estimate, start date and/or dependencies. \n\n## Goals\n- [ ] Review the tasks of the gantt chart. \n  - [ ] Does it represent (to the best of our knowledge) the work related to CI decomposition\n  - [ ] Are the dependencies accurate\n  - [ ] Are the estimates (roughly) accurate\n- [ ] Review the sections of the Gantt Chart\n  - [ ] Can we add more sections to display further fanning out of the work (e.g. sections of development dept)\n- [ ] Once all of the above are checked\n  - [ ] Confirm that parallel tasks on the gantt chart can be parallelized\n  - [ ] **Discuss staffing considerations to determine realistic timeline gains and tradeoffs**\n\n\n## Gantt Chart\n\n2021-07-01 - This is very much a WIP and incomplete. Please update as you see fit and make a comment that it has been updated rather than asking if it can be updated.\nSources of information\n- Sharding Group Progress Updates - Google Docs - https://docs.google.com/document/d/18M77W9tcZpqK0fXp4XGZmEt6bUF_bDivT0oUF9d9uUU/edit?ts=60ddd0f8#\n- Sharding Project Plan 2021-06-23 - Google Docs - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A99PY6zFvzU3HtW0qtr6nEtV10xDv5Y8n7eZKMRCOK0/edit?ts=60d37f89#bookmark=id.7smx9p60e1np\n\n### Understanding The Chart - Decomposition - Blank Check\n\n1. The start/end dates may not be the true dates, but rather showing dependencies and estimated efforts.\n1. When we see parallel work items starting at the same time, this is an opportunity to prioritize the work across multiple people/teams to speed up the timeline. Take the `Discover and mitigate cross-joins`, `Remove FK`, and `Disconnect Joins from CI` as an example - if left to a single team, these would likely be done in serial.\n\n```mermaid\n\ngantt\n    title Decomposition - Blank Check\n    todaymarker off\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    axisFormat  %m-%d\n    section Infrastructure\n    Unblock Prod Data Access :crit, access, 2021-07-06, 10d\n    Set up sharding environment          :setup_sharding_env, after access, 20d\n    Benchmark Replication     :benchmark, after setup_sharding_env  , 20d\n    Test/Enhance replication and observability :test_replication_observability, after benchmark, 30d\n    Repeatable deployment: repeatable_deployment, after setup_sharding_env  , 30d\n    Test/Enhance deployment along moving tables: test_deploy, after repeatable_deployment, 75d\n    CI tables migration execution :migration_execution, after migration_plan, 10d\n    Create observability: create_observability, after migration_execution, 30d    \nsection Sharding Group\n    Test Application Resiliency V1     :  resiliency_v1, after setup_sharding_env  , 20d\n    Migration plan for moving CI tables   : migration_plan, 2021-07-01, 5d\n    Defining 2PC Pattern            :2pc, after migration_plan, 15d\n    Add disable_joins support       :disable_joins, after migration_plan, 20d\n    Discover and mitigate cross-joins :cross_join, after disable_joins, 20d\n    Disconnect joins from CI        :disconnect_join, after disable_joins, 40d\n    Remove FK        :remove_fk, after disable_joins, 40d\n    Move tables: move_tables, after remove_fk, 30d\n    Test Application Resiliency V2 : resiliency_v2, after move_tables, 30d\n    Many Databases Support  :lb, 2021-07-01, 60d\n    Continue LB support             :lb_v2, 2021-07-01, 60d\n    Normalize Data  :normalize, 2021-07-01, 30d\n\n    section Distribution Group\n    Omnibus \u0026 CNG support for GitLab.com:OmnibusCNG, 2021-07-06,  60d\n\n    section Development \n    Identify impact of decomposition: 2021-07-06, 30d\n    \n\n```\n\n### Understanding The Chart - Decomposition - Realistic\n\nThis chart is estimates the timelines and dependencies based on realistic staffing decisions, bandwidth and where we identify trade-offs.

Previously, migrating from a certificate-based connection to an agent-based setup required extra steps and was especially difficult for group and instance-level clusters. By presetting both Kubernetes contexts, migration is largely simplified to selecting the context provided by the agent, instead of the default context, provided by the certificate-based connection.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen a project has both a certificate-based cluster and an agent CI/CD tunnel shared with it, the `KUBECONFIG` only includes the certificate-based cluster's context. This makes it impossible to migrate projects under group-level clusters and instance-level clusters one-by-one to an agnent-based CI/CD workflow.\n\n### Proposal\n\nProvide a merged `KUBECONFIG` that includes both the old certificate-based cluster and the agent contexts.\n\n### Background\n\nOriginally raised by @marshall007:\n\n\u003e Also note that the legacy cluster integration [appears to indiscriminately set the ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1b29140c696f1c3ba6d69031963069f092df9725/app/models/clusters/platforms/kubernetes.rb#L79-91)`KUBECONFIG` CI variable without checking to see if it has already been defined or attempting to merge them. I think it is important that you get a merged `KUBECONFIG` when both integrations are enabled so we can more easily migrate projects away from the legacy cluster

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-02T11:09:26.162Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T08:21:06.588Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T08:21:06.571Z","closed_by":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel

Depending on a model used\nwe can use single or many databases.\n\nThis extends discussions of the issues discussing usage of schema and structures:\n- [Use database SCHEMAs to better isolated CI decomposed features](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333415)\n- [Decide on a single `structure.sql` vs `ci_structure.sql`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334881)\n\nEspecially it is important to get better of the schema-based isolation\nand proposed usage of schemas:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333415#ideally\n- `gitlab_shared`, `gitlab_main`, `gitlab_ci`\n\n### Configuration types\n\nWe can distinguish different configuration types:\n\n1. Using a single monolithic database (not migrated), with a single connection\n2. Using a single monolithic database (not migrated), but with separate configurations\n3. Using two separate logical databases\n\n#### 1. A single monolithic database (not migrated), with a single connection\n\nThis describes a situation of using a single database that only leverages schemas to\nperform logical partitioning / defining boundaries between decomposed features.\nThe are two ways how we can manage structure of such database.\n\nThis model is the least impactful, as it retains the same network and memory requirements\nsince we are not opening nor maintaining new connections. Having many connections can be\na problem in some installations, especially when application connects directly to PostgreSQL\nwithout a proxy like PgBouncer.\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_monolithic\n  schema_search_path: gitlab_ci,gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\n```\n\nIn this model we assume that there's a single structure, with many schemas, and many migrations.\n\n#### 2. A single monolithic database (not migrated), but with separate configurations\n\nThis describes a situation when using a single logical database that only leverages schemas to\nperform logical partitioning / defining boundaries between decomposed features.\nThe difference is that two separate connections are defined\nto the same logical database, but with a different visibility configured.\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_monolithic\n  schema_search_path: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_monolithic\n  schema_search_path: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\nThis model is pretty impactful:\n- `schema_search_path` can break some queries if executed on `main:` with invalid context\n- this can be avoided in a transition period by doing: `main:schema_search_path: gitlab_ci,gitlab_main,gitlab_shared`\n- we require effectively to open twice many connections, which might have negative consequences\n  for the performance if PgBouncer is not used\n- we clearly indicate what is being modified where\n\n#### 3. Using two databases\n\nThis describes a situation when using a many database, leveraging a fully decomposed architecture\nto increase capacity.\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_main\n  schema_search_path: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_ci\n  schema_search_path: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\nThis is end goal for GitLab.com. We ensure that only asked migrations are executed in a given context,\nensuring that things are well described and minimal.\n\n### Shared tables\n\nThis is discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333415#shared-tables","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-02T09:37:22.781Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:22:27.849Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T02:33:07.442Z","closed_by":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"labels":["Category:Pods","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","ci-decomposition-followup","devops::data_stores","group::pods","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Ideally, we would avoid writing directly to cache at all and start letting apollo does it magic to avoid these mix input signals. To do that, I can kind of think of ~~2 ways:~~ (we've decided to do the second option, which is:)\n\u003e\n\u003e Don't use rails at all and use the query right away on load for `getLatestCommitShaQuery`. Then we can start using that query to fetch data after a user commits a file or when switching branch to make sure we are always up to date. We would need to refetch data we already have so I would be careful of how long it would add to the loading, but worth checking out for the clarity it would bring to the code.\n\nSince the commit sha currently comes from two sources (rails injection and graphql), this issue aims to unify this into one single source of truth by doing away with rails and fetching the commit sha as a graphql query from the start.
