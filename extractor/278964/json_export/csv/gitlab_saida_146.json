[{"id":31914750,"iid":210327,"project_id":278964,"title":"Vulnerability List enhancements step 1: Add additional details and update filters","description":"### Background\nAs we add more 3rd-party security scanners as official integration partners, it will become more difficult for users to determine at a glance which scanner a detection came from. Additionally, after [First Class Vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13561) released, scan results will be persistent across runs. This opens the potential for mixing same type (e.g. DAST) results from both the GitLab-provided scanners and one or more 3rd parties. We'll need a clean, clear way to let users easily manage potentially multiple scanners making the same detection.\n\nWe have done a [research issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199394) to provide insights into the proposed solution.\n\nAfter that, the solution has been breakdown into several steps/issues:\n\n* **Step 1.1(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210327): Adding the following info: **Line of code, scanner name and identifier** to the list view. It is a minimum step to help users understand the situation**\n* **Step 1.2(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210327): Update filters**\n* Step 2(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210333): Enable group feature without suggestion. Grouping would be provided as a separate steps\n* Step 3(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210357): Auto-grouping with intro of features \n* Step 4(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210360): docs to explain how the bot(auto-grouping) works \n* Step 5(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210361): Enable/disable auto grouping\n\n### Problem statement for issue one\nWhen there are the same findings detected by different vulnerabilities, how we can help the user understand what's happening, they there are duplications?\n\n### Solution\n**Scope:**\n- The changes only affects Pipeline/Project dashboard only.\n- After https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3427 has been completed, we implement the change in group level\n- After https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3426 has been completed, we implement the change in instance level\n\n\n**Add that information to the list view:**\n\n* Line of code\n* Scanner type and name \n  * in the Scanner column, we only show the Scanner's name when there are multiple ones are in use. If there is not 3rd party connected, all scanners are from GitLab, we hide \"GitLab\", only shows \"SAST\".\n* Identifier to the list view\n  * If a vulnerability has multiple identifiers: \n    * If a CVE is present, show that CVE identifier first as it should be both the most commonly recognized and most specific. \n    * If no CVE, go with whatever identifier is first in the array. \n    * Also show the count of other identifiers as pictured here: \n![image](/uploads/31bfec570d8dd0a321db5b7164e52d80/image.png)\n\n**General Design**\n![Normal](/uploads/1762bcc936355cdefc8142ae954bd595/Normal.png)\n\n**Update filter**\n![Filter-open](/uploads/55e0abe3a6cf87627f1b4551a5009c23/Filter-open.png)\n\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] fix scanner name (#219382)\n- [x] ~backend add information to GraphQL: scanner name and type, line of code, identifier(s)\n  - this can all be derived from the metadata\n    - scanner name: `scanner-\u003ename`\n    - scanner type: `category`\n    - line of code (if available): `location-\u003estart_line`\n    - identifier(s): `identifiers` array \n- [x] ~frontend list view; add identifier column to the project-level security dashboard and pipeline security tab\n  - when identifiers array \u003e 1\n    - only show one identifier\n    - prefer \"CVE\" if it exists\n    - use first identifier otherwise\n- [ ] ~frontend ~~for the identifier column, if there is more than one identifier, show `+ X more` below the primary identifier~~ - moved to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229645\n- [x] ~frontend list view; add scanner column to the project-level security dashboard and pipeline security tab to show the scanner type\n  - work partially done with @stkerr 's MR (!31775)\n- [x] ~frontend add vendor name in the scanner column\n  - instead of showing partner vendor names (i.e. `Gemnasium` and others described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210327#note_363463026), show `GitLab`\n- [ ] ~frontend ~~for the scanner column, when the only vendor is GitLab, hide the vendor name~~ - moved to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229651\n- [ ] ~frontend ~~update scanner filter~~\n  - ~~Show scanner vendor alongside name~~\n  - ~~Dynamically add custom scanner filters that have been configured with the project and that filter for custom scanner vulnerabilities only~~ - moved to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229661\n- [x] ~frontend update docs with new screenshots/wording\n- [ ] ~frontend list view; add identifier column to the group/instance-level security dashboards when https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3426 and https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3427 are completed\n- [ ] ~frontend list view;

DAST documentation recommends overriding the script value to run the tool in air gapped mode. \nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#running-dast-in-an-offline-air-gapped-installation\n\nThis should be changed so that the script value is not changed and only an environment variable is set. Then inside the template the environment variable is used to determine how to call the analyzer. \n\nThis will reduce the complexity of the setup for customers and allow the template script value to change without concern that users are overriding the value.\n\n#### As is\n\nTo create air-gapped support, users must override and copy the script:\n\n```yaml\n   include:\n     - template: DAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n   dast:\n     image: registry.example.com/namespace/dast:latest\n     script:\n        - export DAST_WEBSITE=${DAST_WEBSITE:-$(cat environment_url.txt)}\n        - /analyze -t $DAST_WEBSITE --auto-update-addons false -z\"-silent\"\n```\n\n#### Proposal\n\n- When `auto-update-addons` is configured to `false`, DAST automatically applies the `-silent` ZAP configuration.\n- An environment variable alias is added for `DAST_AUTO_UPDATE_ADDONS`. This could be called `DAST_OFFLINE_MODE` to clearly capture the intent of what it does.\n- In a future release, deprecate the use of the `DAST_AUTO_UPDATE_ADDONS` environment variable name. Add this to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211881\n\nThis would lead to the following configuration for offline DAST\n```yaml\n   include:\n     - template: DAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n   variables:\n     DAST_OFFLINE_MODE: true     \n```\n\nThe `image:` does not need to get set because this MR, will resolve updating the image.\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28617","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-12T02:40:44.524Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T21:04:22.501Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T04:52:13.833Z","closed_by":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","devops::secure","good for new contributors","group::dynamic analysis","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"}],"author":{"id":4310743,"username":"sethgitlab","name":"Seth Berger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4310743/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethgitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5344211,"username":"craigmsmith","name":"Craig Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5344211/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craigmsmith"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210253","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/210253","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/210253/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/210253/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#210253","relative":"#210253","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#210253"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31894833,"iid":210249,"project_id":278964,"title":"Wiki Page Name with ... cannot Edit - Blank Page","description":"Create a Wiki Page with Name \"...\" \nThe Page cannot open/edit or delete.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-11T23:48:22.355Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T03:04:08.266Z","closed_at":"2022-02-14T03:04:08.248Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Please review the epic's [problem statement](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2777#problem) for further context.\n\n## User Experience\n\n* **Group Owner UX:** When GMA is enabled, we should generate a list of users with email ID's that do not comply with the group's whitelisted domain, including a message along the lines of: `These users have not been removed, but have been temporarily blocked from this group and will need to authorise their account to be managed by your group in order to proceed. If they do not reauthorise, they will need to create a new GitLab.com account with a whitelisted email ID.`\n\n* **Group Member UX - Non whitelisted:** When a Group Member is temporarily blocked after GMA is turned on they see a page with a banner message explaining that GMA is enabled and only these whitelisted domains have access to it. They see two options: \n\n1. They can authorise that their account to be managed by the group, if they click authorise and are logged into an account with an email ID that is not whitelisted for that group, they will be denied and asked to either update their email address OR:\n\n2. They can click log out and register for a GitLab.com account with an email ID that's whitelisted. \n\n* **Group Member UX - Whitelisted:** These group members are _logged out_ of the group and asked to do one of the following:\n\n1. They can authorise that their account to be managed by the group\n\n2. They can click log out and register for a GitLab.com account with a different email ID that's also whitelisted, if they prefer not to have the group manage that specific account. \n\nSee the screenshots here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24329 as an example.\n\nSince they are still technically in the group but just blocked, they should still be able to see this page and not a 404 page unless the group owner removes them from the group. \n\nExact copy TBD.\n \n# Why is this important?\n\nPlease see the problem statement outlined [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2777#problem).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-11T23:43:17.890Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T15:46:21.908Z","closed_at":"2021-04-27T15:46:21.780Z","closed_by":{"id":2629166,"username":"lmcandrew","name":"Liam McAndrew","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5801f5e2fd21127836c0be61ec71f06b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lmcandrew"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Deliverable","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","group::authentication and authorization","isolation","missed-deliverable","missed:13.0","priority::1","section::dev","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

workflows","description":"Inspired by: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/29574#note_246349761\n\n### Problem to solve\nThe current [Container Registry documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/) instructs users on how to connect to registry and publish and consume images. However, they do not discuss the user interface, what features are available, how to use the UI to gain information about images, and what to do when something isn't working.  \n\nAs we build out additional features that are outside of the publish/install workflow (image verification, additional metadata, sorting, etc), we should create a new area of documentation that demonstrates how to utilize these features.\n\n### Intended users\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Benefits\n- Help new users who are unfamiliar with the GitLab application get up to speed quickly and find help when they need it.\n- By documenting how to use the UI, we will drive usage and get better feedback on how to improve the overall user experience. \n\n\n### Proposal\nAdd a new section to the Container Registry documentation that details how to use the interface to:\n- Enable the feature using the UI (include screenshots)\n- Navigate to and find a image\n- Understand/use the available metadata\n- Download files\n- Delete images/repositories\n- Troubleshooting\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this feature.\n\n### Documentation\n- Update the Container Registry documentation.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like we drive additional usage of the user interface and build an improved user experience.\n\n### Links /

This would schedule a background job that actually moves the data. The administrator receives a 200 status code almost right away, which does not indicate anything on the background job, only that the jobs was scheduled. The administrator will now be in the dark of the status of data migration, unless the migration was successful and the migration updated the shard information the admin has no clue what's going on.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Proposal\n\nGitLab should provide a good way to get the job status to the user. We could start off by having a POST and GET API endpoint if possible, and allow the administrator to use that. I think ultimately the goal would be an interface somewhat like our [GitHub importer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html#selecting-which-repositories-to-import)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nMoving data around is for administrators only, and this should not change.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nCurrently @nnelson is moving data around at gitlab.com, he's got a script that's long polling for the change in repository_storage.

CLAIR_TIMEOUT variable in Container Scanning and improve i/o timeout error message","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to support the `CLAIR_TIMEOUT` variable provided by [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar#usage):\n\n\u003e CLAIR_TIMEOUT - timeout in minutes before Klar cancels the image scanning. Default is 1\n\nThis will allow users to configure this value and eliminate `i/o timeout` errors\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nThere have been numerous bug reports and zendesk tickets related to an `i/o timeout` error in container scanning:\n\n- [Container Scanning failed to analyze using API v1,3: push](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209009)\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/149012\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/148563\n\nI believe all of these issues are caused by the fact that the default `CLAIR_TIMEOUT` value of 1 minute is not long enough for certain large Docker images. \n\n### Proposal\n\n1. [ ] Add the `CLAIR_TIMEOUT` variable to the list of [`configurableEnvVarValues`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/cb4a3fccd12cdfcc8749f67a5dbd231fd8dfded3/environment/environment.go#L80-85) and set the default value to `5` minutes.\n1. [ ] Add a [custom error message](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/cb4a3fccd12cdfcc8749f67a5dbd231fd8dfded3/analyze/analyze.go#L87-96) when the error text contains `i/o timeout`:\n\n    ```\n    [ERRO] ▶ An i/o error occurred while attempting to push the Docker image data\n     from klar to the clair server.  The current CLAIR_TIMEOUT value is 5 minutes, please\n    increase this number to a higher value.  See the GitLab Container Scanning documentation\n    https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#available-variables\n    for more details\n    ```\n\n1. [ ] Add the `CLAIR_TIMEOUT` variable to the [Available variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#available-variables) section of the Container Scanning documentation.\n1. [ ] Add a test to the [Container Scanning test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/container-scanning) to show that an `i/o timeout` error produces the new error message, and that increasing the `CLAIR_TIMEOUT` value fixes the issue.\n\n### Documentation\n\nSee item `3.` of the [Proposal](#proposal) section\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nSee item `4.` of the [Proposal](#proposal) section\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nThe test added in item `4.` of the [Proposal](#proposal) section will demonstrate success.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"Enterprise

The flow looks like:\n\n- **Download a snapshot of the repo to a temp repo**\n  - Gitaly downloads a snapshot of the repo to yet another temp repo, then moves that to the first temp repo (by the way, I tried calling `create_from_snapshot` on the canonical repo to avoid an extra temp repo step, but Gitaly's `CreateRepositoryFromSnapshot` errors with `destination directory exists`)\n- If there was no error during `fetch_snapshot`, then we exit `redownload_repository` and ensure to `clean_up_temporary_repository`, which **deletes the temp repo**\n\nIt looks like the canonical repository does not get touched?\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- In Rails console on the secondary\n- `r = Geo::ProjectRegistry.last`\n- `r.flag_repository_for_redownload!`\n- `cd` to where `geo.log` is\n- `tail -f geo.log`\n- In the primary UI, add a file to that project repo to 1) trigger a sync and 2) if the logs say it succeeded, we can check the secondary repo to see if in fact it is up-to-date.\n\n```\n{\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"time\":\"2020-03-10T21:14:46.104Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"7dd185e39827e70e3efb4461dcd7662a\",\"class\":\"Geo::RepositorySyncService\",\"host\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"message\":\"Started repository sync\",\"job_id\":\"c1930579cb5fb95a9ca492fc\",\"project_id\":94,\"project_path\":\"gitlab-qa-sandbox-group/qa-test-2020-02-06-15-31-27-35a7b9f7c4c4483f/geo-after-rename-14df8209e611ddfa\",\"storage_version\":2}\n{\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"time\":\"2020-03-10T21:14:46.105Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"7dd185e39827e70e3efb4461dcd7662a\",\"class\":\"Geo::RepositorySyncService\",\"host\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"message\":\"Marking repository sync as started\",\"job_id\":\"c1930579cb5fb95a9ca492fc\",\"project_id\":94,\"project_path\":\"gitlab-qa-sandbox-group/qa-test-2020-02-06-15-31-27-35a7b9f7c4c4483f/geo-after-rename-14df8209e611ddfa\",\"storage_version\":2}\n{\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"time\":\"2020-03-10T21:14:46.112Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"7dd185e39827e70e3efb4461dcd7662a\",\"class\":\"Geo::RepositorySyncService\",\"host\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"message\":\"Trying to fetch repository\",\"job_id\":\"c1930579cb5fb95a9ca492fc\",\"project_id\":94,\"project_path\":\"gitlab-qa-sandbox-group/qa-test-2020-02-06-15-31-27-35a7b9f7c4c4483f/geo-after-rename-14df8209e611ddfa\",\"storage_version\":2}\n{\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"time\":\"2020-03-10T21:14:46.115Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"7dd185e39827e70e3efb4461dcd7662a\",\"class\":\"Geo::RepositorySyncService\",\"host\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"message\":\"Redownloading repository\",\"job_id\":\"c1930579cb5fb95a9ca492fc\",\"project_id\":94,\"project_path\":\"gitlab-qa-sandbox-group/qa-test-2020-02-06-15-31-27-35a7b9f7c4c4483f/geo-after-rename-14df8209e611ddfa\",\"storage_version\":2}\n{\"severity\":\"INFO\",\"time\":\"2020-03-10T21:14:46.115Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"7dd185e39827e70e3efb4461dcd7662a\",\"class\":\"Geo::RepositorySyncService\",\"host\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"message\":\"Attempting to fetch repository via snapshot\",\"job_id\":\"c1930579cb5fb95a9ca492fc\",\"project_id\":94,\"project_path\":\"gitlab-qa-sandbox-group/qa-test-2020-02-06-15-31-27-35a7b9f7c4c4483f/geo-after-rename-14df8209e611ddfa\",\"storage_version\":2}\n\nLocally, I added log output to `clean_up_temporary_repository` which we see in the next line.

I believe this causes more cases to end up with a working sync. For example, if you remove the repository directory from the secondary, or if you mangle the repo in the secondary, Gitaly errors during the snapshot RPC, and we end up doing a fallback `git fetch`.\n\nTherefore, this usually isn't a persistent problem.\n\nHowever, @cat had a customer who encountered repos that somehow could not leave the `redownload` sync flow. In that case, when `force_to_redownload_repository` was manually set to `false`, the repos could successfully sync again.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n- Snapshot flow never truly succeeds.\n- Furthermore, since redownload is the intended flow when retry_count is 5+, it is possible for repos to get stuck in the redownload flow and never sync.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n- Snapshot flow should succeed.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nTested locally on master branch. At least one customer was affected as well.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n[The original implementation called `set_temp_repository_as_main` after `fetch_snapshot`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/5313/diffs#bcdba7848964aa70d648b745f0c1623c7b3d8605_63_63), so the bug was introduced later.\n\nI tried changing \n\n```ruby\nreturn if fetch_snapshot\n```\n\nto \n\n```ruby\nif fetch_snapshot\n  set_temp_repository_as_main\n\n  return\nend\n```\n\nAnd `set_temp_repository_as_main` successfully completed, but there is some other problem.\n\nGitaly errored with ``13:exit status 128`` and was rescued in `rescue Gitlab::Shell::Error, Gitlab::Git::BaseError =\u003e e` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.8.5-ee/ee/app/services/geo/repository_sync_service.rb#L14.\n\nI added additional logging to

Alternate fix\n\n**Update:** I initially thought perhaps we could remove the whole \"redownload\" flow, but some repos are probably getting synced by `git fetch` into a bare repo inside the \"redownload\" flow, so we can only safely remove snapshot. Here's a WIP: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31935\n\nSo I prefer to attempt to fix snapshot flow first, and only remove it as a last resort.\n\nIf it's true that the snapshot flow never succeeds, then it seems to be proven unnecessary. We could remove ~~a decent amount of~~ some complexity.\n\nHere are the original issues:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/39345\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/4767\n\nHere is the initial MR:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/5313\n\n### Severity\n\nFor customers that have repos stuck in the redownload flow, it seems like ~S2, workaround too complex: Assuming you successfully diagnose the problem, you can set `retry_count` to `1` and `force_to_redownload_repository` to `false` in console to get it to use the `git fetch` flow.\n\n~~Fortunately, this bug doesn't seem to impact most customers.~~ More customers are seeing this, see the comments.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-10T21:36:56.810Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T12:50:44.542Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T18:02:58.219Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","customer","devops::systems","group::geo","missed:13.2","priority::3","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209988","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209988","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209988/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209988/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#209988","relative":"#209988","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#209988"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31846403,"iid":209967,"project_id":278964,"title":"Disambiguate 'when local file is used' contexts in uploaders/object_storage_spec.rb","description":"This issue came out of a discussion https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/merge_requests/314/diffs#note_302123646.\n\n`uploaders/object_storage_spec.rb` has two `context` blocks on the same tree level that are both labelled `'when local file is used'`:\n\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/44002f46888a5944c710a04a016f6fa3ef45e466/spec/uploaders/object_storage_spec.rb#L599\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/44002f46888a5944c710a04a016f6fa3ef45e466/spec/uploaders/object_storage_spec.rb#L615\n\nThis issue is to decide if:\n\n- one, or both, should be renamed to disambiguate them.

With it, we can run all the permission checks against `current_user`. The only caution to have here is to not reply `404 Not found` when the container repo or the project is not found but something like `403 Forbidden`. \n\n\u003e This new API endpoint should return the same payload as: `Entities::ContainerRegistry::Repository, tags: true` and in addition have the bulk delete path ( the one returned by this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/22c19861a6b2137e5b57ab04798b81c721349cf0/app/controllers/projects/registry/repositories_controller.rb#L34-35 )\n\u003e \n\u003e Most probably we want to hide that path for non-ui requests ( if is possible )\n\n#### POC\nIn the POC, we made: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26503 \n\nThe API is provisorily implemented with:\n\n```ruby\n      desc 'Get repository details' do\n        detail 'This feature was introduced in GitLab 12.9.'\n        success Entities::ContainerRegistry::Repository\n      end\n      params do\n        requires :repository_id, type: Integer, desc: 'The ID of the repository'\n      end\n      get ':id/registry/repositories/:repository_id' do\n        present repository, with: Entities::ContainerRegistry::Repository, tags: true\n      end\n```\n\nin `lib/api/project_container_repositories.rb` \n\n#### Why it's important\n\nBy expanding the API to allow listing images by ID, we will be able to implement: \n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/208469\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216795\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216761\n\n# Testing and Availability\n\nNeed to refactor:\n -

This would be a handy way to set up rules for when certain policies or variables should be set. One example use case would be making cache-policy settable by “rules” to say for example that you only want to update the cache pull-push on master and not on branches. Another could be setting `interruptible` using various rules.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn this issue, we only add `variables` to the `rules`. Other configs can be added in further iterations.\n\nAdd `variables` to rules to specify variables. To use the example from the problem to solve section, this would look like:\n\n```yaml\n# This will be implemented in #294232.\nworkflow:\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME == \"master\"\n      variables:\n        MY_VAR: \"hello\"\n\nmy_job:\n  ...\n  rules:\n    - if: $MY_OTHER_VAR == \"true\"\n      variables:\n        MY_VAR2: \"hello\" # would only be set for this job\n        MY_VAR: \"hello2\" # overwrite workflow-level override, for this job\n```\n\nAn override will by definition _always_ take precedence over anything set under `variables` in a job or in the pipeline; job-level overrides take precedence over workflow level overrides. We should use the same evaluation policy for rules that conflict as we do for `when`, which is that (only) first matching rule wins.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nNeed to make sure we document that, just like the rest of `rules`, the first matching `rule` wins and only the overrides for that rule will be applied.

Or, if I immediately failback to the original primary, can I avoid resyncing everything on the original secondary?\n\n\u003e If I rsync (perhaps for a more efficient backfill) the repositories to the secondary, will it avoid unnecessary replication?\n\nThere are multiple major components to consider:\n\n- PostgreSQL database\n- Repositories\n- Blobs\n\n### Why?\n\nMany customers have multiple terabytes of data in their Geo primary. Even an extremely fast connection will take a long time to backfill a secondary and will use up a lot of resources. And they already have backups somewhere.\n\nRegarding the rsync question, sometimes this comes up due to a sysadmin's feeling of helplessness when repos are not replicated properly, or verification persistently fails for some repos. I think we have constantly improved on this front and solved corner cases, but in any case, if we solve the backup-restore question, we probably solve this one too.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMVP:\n\n- [x] Confirm there is no security issue with excess repos on disk\n- [x] Open an issue to avoid rereplicating existing Blobs based on checksums =\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352530\n- [-] Update the failover docs to say it is possible to reuse a primary as a secondary =\u003e We intend to do https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352530 already\n  - Include a caveat: Blob types like uploads and artifacts (add link to replicated data types) may be rereplicated (add link to issue to work on avoiding this inefficiency)\n- [x] Add small section to Geo Troubleshooting doc: Mention you can rsync repos, and Geo will pick them up. =\u003e Copied this checkbox to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352530\n\nAnd then:\n\n- [-] Open epic to contain the items below\n- [x] Open issue to: Add a how to doc for creating a secondary from a backup of the primary or another secondary =\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352533\n  - HA first: Attempt it with primary that has a separate DB node\n  - Include a caveat: Your instance may have data where there should be none, which wastes space.\n  - Include a caveat: Blob types like uploads and artifacts (add link to replicated data types) may be rereplicated (add link to issue to work on avoiding this inefficiency)\n  - Weight: 3\n- [x] Open issue to: Add a how to doc for reusing a primary as a secondary after failover =\u003e Added as a TODO in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352530.

To create, edit, view, and delete Wikis, refer to the [Wiki documentation](link-to-doc).`\n* Add a section \"Group Wikis\" into https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/ referencing the new feature and any ins-and-odds particular to the group-level wiki, such as links, permissions, etc. Consider consolidating project and group wiki docs\n\n### Who can address the issue\n\n\u003c!-- What if any special expertise is required to resolve this issue? --\u003e\n\n### Other links/references\n\n\u003c!-- E.g. related GitLab issues/MRs --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-09T17:46:15.753Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:55:04.621Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T14:52:28.895Z","closed_by":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","backend","backend-weight::2","devops::create","documentation","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.4","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"},{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209797","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209797","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209797/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209797/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#209797","relative":"#209797","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#209797"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2214,"epic":{"id":15108,"iid":2214,"title":"[MVC 1] Group-level wiki - Support one wiki at group level","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2214","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31802173,"iid":209792,"project_id":278964,"title":"Append Imported issue metadata","description":"Either as part of the description or as a comment append the following metadata for the original issue\n\nOriginal Jira issue meta-data:\n\u003cpre\u003e\nParent: jira.fields.parent.key\nIssue Type: jira.fields.issuetype\ncomponents: jira.components.id  # if we can pull component name, great\ncustom_field_2000_name: jira.custom_field_id.value # will require getting custom field name based on ID.

The frontend part of it, as prototyped in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33619 , can be worked on at any time, so I'll mark this as ~frontend now (cc @andr3).\n\u003e \n\u003e Paginating the notes endpoint is useful all by itself, so we can work to remove the feature flag for that in the usual way.\n\u003e \n\u003e — @nick.thomas in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217673#note_380981019\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nYes.

Nevertheless, there are two places when this can be conflicting:\n- when we create a new snippet we don't allow empty files\n- we are double syncing (for now) content pushed through git. This means that, if the user pushes an empty file, when we update the snippet, it will raise a validation error.\n\nWe need to remove the `content` presence validation. But, in order to have clearer snippets, we should still reject empty files submitted through the UI. For that we can add the HTML attribute `required=\"required\"`, have some sort of javascript preventing this, and reject as well the operation in the controller.\n\nBasically we want the same behavior that we have at the moment but without the presence validation. This is a soft requirement. It's not a big deal if the user can somehow create an empty snippet because they will be able to do so through git.\n\n/cc @dsatcher","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-09T08:51:55.129Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T14:23:07.508Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T14:23:07.452Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Stretch","backend","backend-weight::1","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This happens when the conditions implemented in the [search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/tree/master/search) package of the [common library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) don't match the `rules` of the scanning job. This undocumented, inconsistent behavior is likely to make both users and developers confused.\n\n**CLOSED:** After long discussions, [we concluded](#note_359701752) that the `rules` syntax cannot accurately describe when a scanning needs to run. So there might be cases where the scanning job is triggered, even though there's nothing to scan. The job `rules` should be considered as an optimization, to avoid running a scanning job for a project that's not compatible.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe `search` is configured by 3 environment variables named `SEARCH_MAX_DEPTH`, `SEARCH_IGNORED_DIRS`, and `SEARCH_IGNORE_HIDDEN_DIRS`. See [search/flags.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.9.2/search/flags.go) to see their default values.\n\nNote that [command/search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/tree/master/search) implements project detection, and not file filtering. Once the scan is triggered, a file might be scanned even if it is excluded by the filters defined in [command/search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/tree/master/search). File exclusion is implemented in [common/pathfilter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/tree/master/pathfilter).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- create a project with files supported by some Dependency Scanning (DS) or SAST analyzer\n- make sure the files supported by the DS or SAST analyzer are ignored based on `SEARCH_MAX_DEPTH`, `SEARCH_IGNORED_DIRS`, or `SEARCH_IGNORE_HIDDEN_DIRS`\n- enable DS or SAST in the CI configuration file (\"no DinD\" setup)\n- trigger a pipeline\n\nThe compatible scanning job is triggered and shows up in the pipeline, but there is no scan and the job exits with code `3`.\n\n### Example Project\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208715\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe scanning job fails with a `No match` error.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll scanning jobs that have been triggered should scan the repository. The scanning jobs that don't match are not triggered, and don't show up in the pipeline.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208715\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nUpdate the [`run` command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.6.0/command/run.go) so that it uses the match function instead of the `search` package:\n- remove [the search flags](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.6.0/command/run.go#L54)\n- do not [use the `search` package](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.6.0/command/run.go#L103)\n- [when `cfg.AnalyzeAll` is false](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.6.0/command/run.go#L114) and the scan is executed in a sub-directory, use `cfg.Match` (the match function) to find a compatible file, and use that the directory of that file as the `target` directory; the walk must exclude files that match `_EXCLUDED_PATHS` otherwise the scan might be executed in the context of a directory that's been explicitly excluded\n- if there's no match, fail with [search.ErrNotFound](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.6.0/search/error.go) error\n\n~~Also, update the job `rules` so that the paths listed in `SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS` and `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` are ignored~~. Out of scope. This depends https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34859 or https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198688, and currently none of these issues has been scheduled.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the `search` package to implement this new behavior.\n\nFor this to work, `SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS` and `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` have to match the current value of `SEARCH_IGNORED_DIRS`. So this issued depends on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220014\n\nAfter implementing this fix, we might still be in the situation where the scanning job is triggered but there's nothing to scan because the paths that match `rules:exists` are excluded by `SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS` or `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` (vulnerability filters).

Problem to solve\n\nBlocked GitLab users are simply redirected back to GitLab's login page with a message about the status of their account, with no further instruction or guidance (for example, whom to contact to remediate the situation).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### MVC\n\nWe should provide admins with the ability to create a custom message which replaces the generic: \"Your account has been blocked, Please contact your gitlab administrator if you think that this is an error.\"\n\n#### Design Criteria\n\n1. [ ] Design for the message on login page\n1. [ ] Design for admin setting\n\n### Future Iteration Opportunity\n\nTo provide guidance to blocked users on what steps to undertake to recover their account, [a customer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000W44Pc) proposed an interesting feature. In the customer's words:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n...we were thinking that this could be a URL that is defined in the gitlab.rb file where a user would be directed to that URL when they have authenticated successfully but where their account is in a blocked state.  If this setting exists in the rb file then GitLab would redirect the user to it and if it does not exist then GitLab would function as it normally does which is to dump the user back onto the login page with a message about being blocked.\n\nBy redirecting to another URL we could do various things like simply have a web page that displays additional info about what the user should do to get unblocked or we could even build an automated process that will use our SSO to auth the user again and then in the background unblock them using an API call and then redirect the user back to GitLab.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nAs above, provide self-managed administrators with the option to specify a redirect URL in their Gitlab configuration where they could host a page with instructions on next steps for blocked users.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-07T03:10:24.255Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T20:45:19.629Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T00:33:45.813Z","closed_by":{"id":5058729,"username":"mnearents","name":"Matthew Nearents","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5058729/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mnearents"},"labels":["Technical Writing","UI text","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","product work","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4587943,"username":"jrreid","name":"Jamie Reid","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4587943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jrreid"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209341","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209341","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209341/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209341/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#209341","relative":"#209341","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#209341"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3219,"epic":{"id":50576,"iid":3219,"title":"Improve user management for admins and group owners","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3219","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31695121,"iid":209327,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display badge if a user is a GitLab employee [BE]","description":"~backend counterpart to #207118.

Included is a parallel wizard of \"promoting\" the group to an organisation (space/workspace) as another route we could use to engineer group managed accounts (as separate from SAML SSO):\n\n| Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 | Step 4 |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![step1](/uploads/8bbd17145c848004a46fc7ef78e860a6/step1.png) | ![step2](/uploads/f5ef7820c852c26119a8501556387d82/step2.png) | ![step3](/uploads/1c188e89f209ab5ea67459e8112d8a46/step3.png) | ![step4](/uploads/fb5276bdc18990d1de41750e0ebf7c49/step4.png) |\n\nUpon discussion with the backend team, we decided to go with option 1.

li elements for all dropdown items in the vulnerability state dropdown","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue originates from this MR comment: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24847#note_296388758\n\nIn `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vulnerabilities/components/vulnerability_state_dropdown.vue`, there's a `\u003cdiv\u003e` that contains two buttons, but it's a sibling of a bunch of `\u003cli\u003e` elements inside of a `\u003cul\u003e`. This is to work around a global `.dropdown-menu li` class that will format buttons a certain way, and using `\u003cli\u003e` as the parent element will make them look incorrect:\n\n| Using a li | What it should look like |\n| ---------- | ------------------------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/c97b298d274aaec0dc3993aa3e068548/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/193038a88091475b74b4e22b1bf1414f/image.png) |\n\nWe should fix it so that the `\u003cdiv\u003e` is turned into a `\u003cli\u003e` element in order to keep semantically correct HTML. An override class needs to be added to the `.dropdown-menu li` that will undo the built-in style that it applies to the buttons.\n\n## Improvements\n\nThis change will turn semantically incorrect HTML into semantically correct HTML, which can benefit browsers that expect semantically correct HTML (for example, screen readers and other assistive devices).\n\n## Risks\n\nNone. The change will change an element from an incorrect type to the correct type.\n\n## Involved components\n\n`ee/app/assets/javascripts/vulnerabilities/components/vulnerability_state_dropdown.vue`\n`app/assets/stylesheets/framework/dropdowns.scss`\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\nA new class will be added to dropdowns.scss, which will be global for all pages. It needs to be unique enough to not be inadvertently applied to any existing classes.\n\n## Implementation\n\nPerhaps the `gl-dropdown` should style buttons differently if there are multiple buttons in a single dropdown li; sort of like a special footer styling for cases like this. I am surprised this is not an option already.\n\nThere are several styles that need to change:\n\n```css\nborder: 0 // auto/inherit,\nborder-radius: 0 // 10,\ndisplay: block //inline-block,\nwidth: 100% // inherit,\n// plus some hover state styling\n```\n\nWe should do the work in GitLab UI so that it can be reused in the future. It may be worth checking if `\u003cb-dropdown\u003e` (what `GlDropdown` uses internally) supports buttons:\n\nhttps://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/dropdown\n\nand if it does, figure out how to make that work when used with `GlDropdown`. There's also a `GlNewDropdown` that might be worth looking into as well:\n\nhttps://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-new-dropdown--default\n\nIt may have support for the buttons already.\n\nN/A","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-06T10:44:10.047Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T15:08:01.298Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T15:08:01.275Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::secure","frontend","good for new contributors","group::threat insights","section::sec","type::maintenance","vulnerability interaction","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

reports skipped tests as passed","description":"### Summary\n\nJUnit integration reports skipped tests as passed\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n[Sasha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) is writing unit tests along with code with results in a format GitLab can consume and report on about what [passed and failed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html). This is great if all tests are run but Sasha is starting to write more complex tests that are sometimes skipped based on previous test results or other external factors to the test suite. Today those skipped tests are showing up as successful test executions in the GitLab reports, an incorrect signal to Sasha and the team about the reliability of their code.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who is seeing test results in pipeline results and merge requests.\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test) - Who is validating test coverage and effectiveness of those tests.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis enhances the [JUnit reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#viewing-junit-test-reports-on-gitlab) which already has a column for skipped but is not being populated today.\n\nA future enhancement could be to update the [Test Summary Widget](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#how-it-works) to include additional information about the tests skipped on the head branch compared to results on the base branch.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Go to the following repository: https://gitlab.com/marknelson/junit-issue-reproducer\n* Run the CI/CD pipeline in that repository, or just look at this run:\nhttps://gitlab.com/marknelson/junit-issue-reproducer/pipelines/123638823\n* Look at the job output: https://gitlab.com/marknelson/junit-issue-reproducer/-/jobs/460993965\n* Notice, at the end it reports the test results:\n\n    ```\n     Ran 1 of 2 Specs in 0.003 seconds\n     SUCCESS! -- 1 Passed | 0 Failed | 0 Pending | 1 Skipped\n     PASS\n    ```\n\n* The JUnit file produced has the same info, for reference: \n\n    ````\n    \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e\n      \u003ctestsuite name=\"My Test Suite\" tests=\"1\" failures=\"0\" errors=\"0\" time=\"0\"\u003e\n          \u003ctestcase name=\"Tests can pass\" classname=\"My Test Suite\" time=\"5.28e-06\"\u003e\u003c/testcase\u003e\n          \u003ctestcase name=\"Tests can be skipped\" classname=\"My Test Suite\" time=\"0.00021871\"\u003e\n              \u003cskipped\u003e\u003c/skipped\u003e\n          \u003c/testcase\u003e\n      \u003c/testsuite\u003e\n    ````\n\n* Now look at the tests tab in the pipeline: https://gitlab.com/marknelson/junit-issue-reproducer/pipelines/123638823/test_report\n* Notice it reports 2 passed, 0 skipped. It should report 1 passed, 1 skipped.\n\n### Example Project\n\nsee above\n\n### What is the current behavior?\nGitLab CI pipeline test report counts skipped tests as \"passed\".\n\n### What is the expected new behavior?\n\nGitLab CI pipeline test report should count skipped tests as \"skipped\".\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nsee above\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com (and on our private installation too)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThis seems to be a spec/test for this feature, it does not seem to inlcude a test for \nskipped tests:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acc05479b1723f8804579548d8d3bde2478c18fd/spec/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/test/junit_spec.rb\n\nThis code seems to be where it creates the report - it seems to only handle pass, fail and error, not skipped.\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acc05479b1723f8804579548d8d3bde2478c18fd/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/test/junit.rb#L48\n\nAll of the serializers and `Test(Reports|Suites|Case)` classes seems to handle `skipped` already, and we're just not correctly parsing out the `skipped` status in `Ci::Parsers::Test:Junit#create_test_case`. Adding some failure-affirming specs there and then adding handling for skipped cases should do the trick.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis enhances the [JUnit reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#viewing-junit-test-reports-on-gitlab) which already has a column for skipped but is not being populated today.\n\nA future enhancement will be to update the [Test Summary Widget](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/junit_test_reports.html#how-it-works) to include additional information about the tests skipped on the head branch compared to results on the base branch.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-05T15:53:59.406Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T04:04:20.410Z","closed_at":"2020-03-31T17:20:35.826Z","closed_by":{"id":4512666,"username":"jheimbuck_gl","name":"James Heimbuck","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8dd2ef9c1cacb6e80d7ca47db6f0ce22?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jheimbuck_gl"},"labels":["CEO Interest","Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Verify::P1","customer","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","group::pipeline insights","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"}],"author":{"id":2091887,"username":"marknelson","name":"Mark Nelson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3ec1d0633da2bc3e6fac237f2ce78358?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marknelson"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209099","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209099","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209099/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209099/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#209099","relative":"#209099","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#209099"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2950,"epic":{"id":33616,"iid":2950,"title":"Unit Test Report CI View MVC enhancements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2950","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31621658,"iid":209089,"project_id":278964,"title":"Monaco Editor Lite should use syntax highlighting theme from user's preferences","description":"### Summary\n\nAt the moment, the Editor Lite (single-file editor) is always on the white background.

Parent pipeline fails immediately showing an error `child-pipeline does not depend on a generate-config job`\n\n---\n\nOriginal discussion: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23790#note_298174064","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-05T12:07:13.409Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T09:26:34.925Z","closed_at":"2020-04-14T09:25:45.184Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Verify::P1","backend","customer","devops::verify","documentation","group::pipeline execution","missed:12.9","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209070","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209070","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209070/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/209070/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#209070","relative":"#209070","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#209070"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2750,"epic":{"id":25852,"iid":2750,"title":"Parent-Child Pipeline MVC \u0026 Follow-Ups","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2750","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31611969,"iid":209063,"project_id":278964,"title":"Should we log the usage ping errors","description":"```ruby\n      rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid\n        { avg_cycle_analytics: {} }\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-05T11:29:27.224Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T00:19:59.654Z","closed_at":"2021-12-06T23:42:18.850Z","closed_by":{"id":8013274,"username":"pskorupa","name":"Piotr Skorupa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8013274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pskorupa"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::growth","group::product intelligence","section::growth"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
