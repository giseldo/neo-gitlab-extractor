Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e instance_level_integration_overrides true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set instance_level_integration_overrides \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set instance_level_integration_overrides \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set instance_level_integration_overrides true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `instance_level_integration_overrides`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `instance_level_integration_overrides` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete instance_level_integration_overrides --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete instance_level_integration_overrides --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete instance_level_integration_overrides`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set instance_level_integration_overrides false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-23T08:41:08.919Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:37:17.645Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T21:39:38.251Z","closed_by":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"labels":["auto updated","devops::manage","feature flag","frontend","group::integrations","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":4704683,"username":"justin_ho","name":"Justin Ho Tuan Duong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4704683/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justin_ho"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336750","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":10},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"10 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336750","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336750/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336750/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#336750","relative":"#336750","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#336750"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":90712528,"iid":336746,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow to delete deployments via API","description":"### Release notes\n\nIn 15.3, we are adding the ability to delete deployments via API.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

a `Revoke` button in the agent access token list.\n- When the button is pressed an blocking alert is raised where the users need to confirm the deletion, or can cancel it.\n\n## Definition of done\n\n- [x] The revoke button is present in the agent access token list.\n- [x] The revoke button is disabled for users with less than maintainer role.\n- [x] For users with at least maintainer rights clicking on the button opens a confirmation popup.\n- [x] The popup contains an input to confirm the revoke action and a cancel button.\n- [x] After the token was revoked, the token list gets

Go to DataDog Integration setting: https://gitlab.com/:user:/:project:/-/services/datadog/edit (requires permission)  \n2. In the **Datadog site** field, set the value to `\"\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert()\u003c/script\u003e`, then **Save**  \n3.

This documentation mentions that each diff note provides a `in_reply_to_id`, which can be used to create Gitlab discussions.\n\n#### Implementation details\n\n- When the `in_reply_to_id` is empty\n  - Create a new `discussion_id`\n  - Map the `pull_request_comment.id` to the `discussion_id` created on redis (Github original id for the diff note). Example: `8 -\u003e f9f509e301c2ff6112a365ca066cda63c183530c`, where:\n    - `8` is the original github id for the diff note;\n    - `f9f509e301c2ff6112a365ca066cda63c183530c` is the `discussion_id`;\n- When the `in_reply_to_id` has a value\n  - Use the _github_id-\u003ediscussion_id_ map to find the discussion id related to the `in_reply_to_id`;\n  - Use the found `discussion_id` on the new diff note;\n  - Add another entry to the _github_id-\u003ediscussion_id_ map to map the new diff note to the discussion_id, like `9 -\u003e f9f509e301c2ff6112a365ca066cda63c183530c`;\n- Currently there's no documentation wether the GithubImporter imports or not threaded notes, therefore an update on the documentation must be done (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html#import-your-project-from-github-to-gitlab);\n- Example of implementation

fetching group projects with security reports","description":"Discovered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62092 we found [ee/app/finders/ee/group_projects_finder.rb](ee/app/finders/ee/group_projects_finder.rb) joins between CI and non-CI tables when the `with_security_reports` is called. It looks like this finder uses the `:with_security_reports` scope.\n\nIt seems we have a [group project API where we can filter a group's projects by whether it has `with_security_reports`](), or not.\n\nThe query that is failing in question:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"projects\".* FROM ((SELECT \"projects\".* FROM \"projects\" WHERE \"projects\".\"namespace_id\" = 8 AND (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM \"project_authorizations\" WHERE \"project_authorizations\".\"user_id\" = 3 AND (project_authorizations.project_id = projects.id)) OR projects.visibility_level IN (10,20)))\nUNION\n(SELECT \"projects\".* FROM \"projects\" INNER JOIN \"project_group_links\" ON \"projects\".\"id\" = \"project_group_links\".\"project_id\" WHERE \"project_group_links\".\"group_id\" = 8 AND (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM \"project_authorizations\" WHERE \"project_authorizations\".\"user_id\" = 3 AND (project_authorizations.project_id = projects.id)) OR projects.visibility_level IN (10,20)))) projects WHERE \"projects\".\"pending_delete\" = FALSE AND (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM \"ci_job_artifacts\" WHERE \"ci_job_artifacts\".\"file_type\" IN (5, 6, 7, 8, 21, 23, 26, 27) AND (ci_job_artifacts.project_id = projects.id))) ORDER BY \"projects\".\"id\" DESC\n```\n\n## Failing spec\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs/1440069680\n\n## Options\n\n1. Introduce a new table to store whether or not a project has security reports (de-normalization) and UPSERT into this table whenever we create security reports. Could be called `projects_with_security_reports` and only needs to contain the `project_id` for this use case.\n2. Change this sub-select to 3 separate queries. Firstly load all the relevant projects (this should be bounded by the fact that it's a group API filter) and then do another query to find the list of those that have `ci_job_artifacts` with `file_type IN` then use the filtered list of project ids to find the final list of projects. This is probably not a good option for very large groups with thousands of projects because our usage in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d6f264fc4a623ce7892186e64cbc3c1a2507a993/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/store/modules/projects/actions.js is including subgroups and not filtering much. Since the ordering and pagination is on the projects it would not be possible to order and limit the first candidate set of project ids much so it would mean sending thousands of project ids in the intermediate query when ultimately we're only going to want 100. This would look something like:\n   ```rb\n   scope :with_security_reports, -\u003e do\n     project_id_currently_filtered = self.pluck(:id)\n     filtered_project_ids_with_security_reports = ::Ci::JobArtifact.security_reports.where(project_id: project_id_currently_filtered).distinct.pluck(:project_id)\n   \n     where(id: filtered_project_ids_with_security_reports)\n   end\n   ```\n3. Is there some other table that already stores some metadata about security reports that isn't in the `ci_*` tables that we could join to? (eg. `security_scans` or `security_findings` noting that `security_scans` is going to be de-normalized to have a `project_id` column soon to avoid joining `ci_builds`)\n\n## Sharding team recommended option\n\nIntroduce a new table to store whether or not a project has security reports (de-normalization) and UPSERT into this table whenever we create security reports. Could be called `projects_with_security_reports` and only needs to contain the `project_id` for this use case.\n\nFurthermore this looks a lot like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336199 so we may want to fix both in 1 go with a combined table to solve both problems called `projects_with_ci_feature_usage` with 2 columns `project_id, ci_feature` and then we can just store `\"code_coverage\"` and `\"security_report\"` in the `ci_feature` column when this is first used for the project.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for previous implementation plan\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n1.

Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace *all* the (parenthesized) sections below with the pertinent details. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\n\n#####  Summary\n\nBy modifying the **access_level** field in **project_members.ndjson** file, developers can import new projects where they have a maintainer role.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n\n1. Create 2 accounts  \n2. Create a group with account A  \n3. Invite account B to the group as with a max role of developer\n\n![bandicam_2021-07-09_17-35-44-867.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1ab92fc5-797d-4241-898d-6da1f585eb50/bandicam_2021-07-09_17-35-44-867.jpg)\n\n4. With account B, export any project you own  \n5. Modify the **access_level** field in **project_members.ndjson** file in that project. Change it to 40 (maintainer)\n\n![bandicam_2021-07-09_16-22-55-049.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8ba92a73-d92d-47bd-a676-7a110cd20bbd/bandicam_2021-07-09_16-22-55-049.jpg)\n\n6. Import that project to the group where you have only developer access  \n7. You should have maintainer access in that imported project\n\n![bandicam_2021-07-09_17-35-11-737.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0473337d-4824-483c-8712-2a64cc1b7a82/bandicam_2021-07-09_17-35-11-737.jpg)\n\n![bandicam_2021-07-09_17-35-32-850.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/991c1af9-0370-4c71-8755-dfc800454f89/bandicam_2021-07-09_17-35-32-850.jpg)\n\nOne of the attack scenarios would be to import a project as a maintainer, add a deploy token or key and then demote yourself to a developer role or leave the project entirely. Combined with #686359, a user doesn't even have to be a member of that group to be able to download the project.\n\n#####  Examples\n\n(If the bug is project related, please create an example project and export it using the project export feature)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also help determine whether the bug has been fixed in a more recent version)\n\n(If the bug can be reproduced on GitLab.com without violating the `Rules of Engagement` as outlined in the program policy, please provide the full path to the project.)\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDevelopers can have a maintainer role in the projects that they import.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nDevelopers should have a max role of a developer in the projects that they import.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,  \nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:  \n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:  \n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n####  Impact\n\nDevelopers can have a maintainer role in the projects that they import.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-20T14:36:23.384Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T08:24:09.580Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T08:24:09.553Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","feature flag","group::compliance","ideal for new hires","priority::3","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336520","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":12},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"12 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336520","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336520/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336520/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#336520","relative":"#336520","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#336520"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":90563077,"iid":336516,"project_id":278964,"title":"(4) Pseudonymize Snowplow events sent from frontend layer","description":"## Summary\n\nWith GitLab Standard Context being pseudonymized Snowplow events can start record user level behaviors without connecting them to natural person interacting with the system. \n\n## Goal\n\nMake sure that frontend triggered events uses GitLab Standard Context with pseudonymized data","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-20T13:56:54.418Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T18:30:21.886Z","closed_at":"2021-09-13T12:53:26.572Z","closed_by":{"id":3509693,"username":"nicolasdular","name":"Nicolas Dular","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c4a21f15150c12ddf13fd848597cddd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolasdular"},"labels":["auto updated","backend","devops::growth","group::product intelligence","missed:14.2","section::growth","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It should check whether a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file exists in the repository, rather than just checking that the project is configured to use the _default path_ for the CI file.\n\nI think this behaviour was broken in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54498. \n\nThe [specs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/66e23443515cfc0ffbd7c63301d270953d4ec7de/ee/spec/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter_spec.rb#L218-228) for the `Security::ConfigurationPresenter` should be updated to correctly test this behaviour as well.\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. [ ] See [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70025) for a starting point\n\n1. [ ] Update [`ee/app/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/9e0fc4490e7/ee/app/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter.rb#L23-23) to rely on the presence of an actual `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the repository instead of the [current logic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f9e1d658e88/app/models/project.rb#L2529-2532) which only checks whether the custom `ci_config_path` option is blank or set to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:\n\n   ```diff\n             latest_pipeline_path: latest_pipeline_path,\n             auto_fix_enabled: autofix_enabled,\n             can_toggle_auto_fix_settings: auto_fix_permission,\n   -         gitlab_ci_present: project.uses_default_ci_config?,\n   +         gitlab_ci_present: project.repository.gitlab_ci_yml,\n             gitlab_ci_history_path: gitlab_ci_history_path,\n             auto_fix_user_path: '/' # TODO: real link will be updated with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215669\n   ```\n\n   Rather than accessing `project.repository.gitlab_ci_yml` directly from within `configuration_presenter.rb`, we'll probably want to create a method in [app/models/project.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f9e1d658e88/app/models/project.rb#L2529-2529) such as `gitlab_ci_present?`, which returns `project.repository.gitlab_ci_yml`.\n\n1. [ ] Ensure the above change doesn't have any negative performance impacts, since we're switching from a simple database lookup to a file system lookup via git. There probably shouldnt't be any concerns since I don't think this page is a high traffic area, and the value from git should be cached, but this should be confirmed.\n\n1. [ ] Fix all tests broken by the above

we plan to configure the Rails application to:\n\n1. Use pgbouncer-ci.int.gprd.gitlab.net as primary connection for CI tables \n1. Use service discovery for db-ci-replica.service.consul for replica connections for CI tables use\n\nHowever, in the beginning `db:ci` will be setup as a replica of `db:main`. So for this period, we **should not** run any migrations, DDL or data, for the `db:ci` connection. But rather we rely on replication.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Add instructions on how to setup replicas locally\n1. Configure GDK to disable `database_tasks: false` for CI database\n\nHave configuration in the application, likely in config/database.yml to disable database migrations for the `ci:` database.\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42794 was just merged in Rails which looks very promising\n\n/cc @gitlab-org/sharding-group","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-20T08:41:14.214Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T21:23:29.506Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T20:59:34.403Z","closed_by":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"labels":["Category:Database","Category:Pods","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","ci-decomposition","ci-decomposition::phase3","devops::data_stores","group::database","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","missed:14.5","pods::active","section::enablement"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

There is an [existing issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28226) tracking the fix of the `shared groups` information.\n\n**[HackerOne report #1255128](https://hackerone.com/reports/1255128)** by `0xn3va` on 2021-07-08, assigned to @ankelly:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nFor a public project, that provided access to only project members, Gitlab discloses issues/merge request templates and a name of the private group shared with the project.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Log in as an `user1`  \n2. Create private group `private-group`  \n3. Create a public project `public-project`  \n4. Go to the Members page of the public project `Project information \u003e Members` and invite the private group  \n5. Go to the project settings `Settings \u003e General` and change values from `Everyone With Access` to `Only Project Members` within the `Visibility, project features, permissions` section  \n6. On the same page open the `Merge requests` section and set a default description template of MR within `Default description template for merge requests`  \n7. On the same page open the `Default description template for issues` section and set a default description template of issues  \n8. Log in as an `user2`  \n9. Get the project details via API:\n\n    ```bash  \n    $ curl -v -X GET -H \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cuser-2-token\u003e\" \"http://0xn3va.gitlab.local/api/v4/projects/\u003cproject-id\u003e\"  \n    ```\n\n10. The response contains information about the private group inside `shared_with_groups` (it is also available in UI) and issue/MR templates inside `issues_template`/`merge_requests_template`.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nThe `shared_with_groups` discloses id and full path of private projects. The`issues_template`/`merge_requests_template` discloses the content of templates that may contain sensitive information, internal links, or links to project uploads (such as `http://0xn3va.gitlab.local/deepheep/uploads/f2e66c888f453e7584042d22bde49088/filename.txt`; since the `user2` has the read permissions `user2` able to get these uploaded files).\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsers with reading permission in the project with the `Only Project Members` visibility have access to values of `shared_with_groups`, `issues_template`, `merge_requests_template`.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUsers with reading permission in the project with the `Only Project Members` visibility should not have access to values of `shared_with_groups`, `issues_template`, `merge_requests_template`.\n\n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nResponse example:\n\n```json  \n{\"id\":17,\"description\":\"project

As a result, the generated Dependency Scanning report might change, and the expected report needs to be updated.

However, these projects don't need to change.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. [x] Update the [comparable module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/blob/main/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/comparable.rb#L102) to ignore a field if it equals `:SKIP:`.\n1. [x] Ensure that the [CycloneDX shared examples](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/fcd4183/spec/cyclonedx_shared_examples_spec.rb#L6-6) will also ignore fields containing `:SKIP:`.\n1. [x] Update the [report_shared_examples.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/blob/c10e5bbd3a64d74010fc929efdaebe847ffa0d01/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/shared_examples/report_shared_examples.rb) to use `include_json` instead of `eql`.\n1. [x] Add unit tests to the `integration-test` project to verify that fields marked `:SKIP:` are ignored.\n1. [x] Remove sorting from the [GitlabSecure::IntegrationTest::Comparable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/blob/0fcd301/lib/gitlab_secure/integration_test/comparable.rb#L14-14) module.\n1. [x] Update the `Report.Sort()` function of the `report` package to sort `Vulnerabilities` by `Severity`, `CompareKey`, and `Location.Dependency.Version` (if available)\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/report/-/merge_requests/51+\n1. [x] Update the expectation files in the `gemnasium` project to mark some of the vulnerability/dependency fields as `:SKIP:`. The following MRs have updated expectations fields that have changed as a result of moving dependency targets and can be used as a starting point.\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/npm-audit/-/merge_requests/19+\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/172+\n1. [x] Update the expectations in `gemnasium` that have changed after implementing steps `5` and `6` above.\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/444+\n1. [x] Add a job that checks if a field marked as `:SKIP:` is removed. The job should include `allow_failure: true` so that it does not block MR progress, but does alert the reviewer(s).\n   \n   The following script that can be used to check for this as a first iteration:\n\n   ```shell\n   # Check if the proposed changes remove a field with value \":SKIP:\".\n   DIFF_CHECK=$(git diff $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_SHA $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_SHA | egrep '^-[^\"]*\"[^\"]+\":\\s?\":SKIP:\"')\n   if [[ $DIFF_CHECK != \"\" ]];

the sub-directory name is `test_project_name/test_case_name`, and the default test case is \"main\"\n- add an RSpec group that replicates what's tested in the downstream pipeline\n- make sure that the new RSpec examples are executed when running the `image test` job\n- remove the downstream pipeline from the CI config\n\nKeep at least one job integration test, to check the job definition.\n\nImage integration tests are implemented using the [integration-test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test) project. See gemnasium's [spec/image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/9ce00d783cac7a74957329b99514413cf30a35dd/spec/image_spec.rb).\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nRepeat the steps of the [proposal](#proposal) for all Dependency Scanning analyzer projects:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js\n\n## Improvements\n\n- Image integration tests can run locally.\n- They are easier to maintained, compared to job integration tests using external test projects.\n- They run faster because there's no need to spin off a new job for each test case.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe might miss a case where the job definition can't be ignored. For instance, the image test might not set all the environment variables set in the scanning job. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330093#optional-missing-test-coverage.\n\nIt might take longer to execute the pipeline if too many long-running tests are combined in a single `image test` job. This might be a problem in the case of gemnasium-maven, gemnasium-python and retire.js because they build the project.\n\nThere might be leftover when building a project during the test, with possible side-effects.

I think this is due to this check: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v14.0.1-ee/app/services/import/base_service.rb#L16\n\nBut, if the user enters the target group and try to import a group using `GitLab export` option, the current group is listed. `BitBucket cloud` importer will not list this group still.\n\nSo, I feel this behaviour should be consistent across all the importers.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a user and link it with a Bitbucket cloud account.\n- Grant this user developer permissions on a group.\n- Make sure the setting `Allowed to create projects` for the group is set to `Developers + Maintainers`.\n- Enter this group as the above user.\n- Try to create a new project and import using `GitLab export`. This will list the group namespace correctly.\n- Now, re-enter the group and try to import a project using `BitBucket cloud` importer, it will only show the user namespace.\n  - Had the user been an owner of the group/namespace, it should have been listed properly.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGroup list should be consistent for various importers.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGroup list is not consistent across various importers.\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\t\tUbuntu 18.04\nProxy:\t\tno\nCurrent User:\tgit\nUsing RVM:\tno\nRuby Version:\t2.7.2p137\nGem Version:\t3.1.4\nBundler Version:2.1.4\nRake Version:\t13.0.3\nRedis Version:\t6.0.14\nGit Version:\t2.32.0\nSidekiq Version:5.2.9\nGo Version:\tunknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:\t14.0.3-ee\nRevision:\tb6033e36824\nDirectory:\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL\nDB Version:\t12.6\nURL:\t\thttps://ps-gitlab.sr.gitlab.support\nHTTP Clone URL:\thttps://ps-gitlab.sr.gitlab.support/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:\tgit@ps-gitlab.sr.gitlab.support:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:\tno\nGeo:\t\tno\nUsing LDAP:\tno\nUsing Omniauth:\tyes\nOmniauth Providers: openid_connect, bitbucket\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:\t13.19.0\nRepository storage paths:\n- default: \t/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\nGit:\t\t/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n[WARNING] Object storage for pages must have a bucket specified\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

The first iteration focuses on a database for CI and a database for the rest of the functionality. There are likely customers that depend on all of the data coming from a single database. This issue is to gather information, determine the impact of decomposing the database and create issues to resolve those dependencies to work with the new architecture. \n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327019 for the SQL queries executed by the Rails backend for the Dependency Scanning and License Scanning features.\n\n#### Implementation\n1. Architecture overview https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6168#solution.\n1. For the first iteration -\n   1. All `ci_*` tables will be moved into a second logical database.\n   1. All the other tables remain in one logical database.\n   1. [Migration plan of `ci_*` tables](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/sharding/migrate-ci-tables-to-new-database-plan.html).\n1. The most part of implementation is based on [Rails 6 multi DB support](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html) so in simple terms we configure Rails to know which DB to use for each Rails model.\n1. [Remove all foreign keys that cross-join from/to CI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333412).\n1. [Make schema migrations aware of multiple databases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334232).\n\n### Request\n\n1. Determine whether the impact is on the critical path of the first iteration.\n1. Find a solution as the details become clear.\n\nExamine how data is extracted from the database then think about how decomposed databases could impact your features.\n\n1. Do you see potential impacts from the decomposition PoC https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62092?\n1. Do you connect to the database directly?\n1. Does your feature require data joins from the two logical databases?\n1. Does your ActiveRecord query span tables in the two logical databases?\n\n### Result\n\nThere are several issues listed under https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6373 for things that need to be fixed.\n\n/cc @NicoleSchwartz","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-15T15:47:33.690Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T07:06:10.312Z","closed_at":"2021-07-21T15:41:10.328Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","section::sec","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-07-30","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336267","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336267","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336267/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336267/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#336267","relative":"#336267","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#336267"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6289,"epic":{"id":302020,"iid":6289,"title":"Decomposition: Identify other teams and features impacted by decomposing the database","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6289","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":90344016,"iid":336265,"project_id":278964,"title":"FE: Max User count activity tweak graph to support UI","description":"Background -

But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior.

Probably the best option is to introduce a combined table to solve both problems called `projects_with_ci_feature_usage` with 2 columns `project_id, ci_feature` and then we can just store `\"code_coverage\"` and `\"security_report\"` in the `ci_feature` column when this is first used for the project.\n\nThe resulting query would then be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"projects\".* FROM \"projects\"\nINNER JOIN \"projects_with_ci_feature_usage\" ON \"projects_with_ci_feature_usage\".\"project_id\" = \"projects\".\"id\"\nWHERE \"projects_with_ci_feature_usage\".\"ci_feature\" = 'code_coverage'\n```\n\n### Steps to take based on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336617\n\n1. Create MR to introduce the new `projects_with_ci_feature_usage` table. Don't implement any logic yet that inserts into the table so we can quickly iterate and have the model available to both https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336199 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336590.\n1. For https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336199, we can implement MR that upserts into `projects_with_ci_feature_usage` when we execute the `Ci::DailyBuildGroupReportResultService`. But don't query the new table yet.\n1. Implement MR for backfilling new table with projects that have coverage.\n1. Finally, fix the query to use the new table.\n\nSteps 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 can possibly be in the same MR.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-15T06:04:04.965Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:55:07.723Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T16:26:58.062Z","closed_by":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","Engineering Allocation","FY22::Q3","SaaS","Verify::P2","bug::performance","ci-decomposition","devops::verify","gitlab.com","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:14.2","missed:14.3","reliability","section::ops","severity::2","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"user_notes_count":44,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336199","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336199","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336199/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/336199/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#336199","relative":"#336199","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#336199"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6588,"epic":{"id":328775,"iid":6588,"title":"Engineering Allocation: Improve SaaS Reliability in the Verify stage","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6588","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 8, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":90310699,"iid":336198,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix Security features tables cross-joining `ci_builds` to map pipeline -\u003e security scans","description":"From https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62092 we have seen that [`VulnerabilityCountingService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/3ad37425a49fcce394127ffaf425e4b408776ad4/ee/app/services/security/vulnerability_counting_service.rb) needs to join between non `ci_*` tables and `ci_*` tables.\n\nBut this will not be possible once we move ci_builds to a separate database.\n\nThe particular query comes from `Pipeline#security_findings`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"security_findings\".* FROM \"security_findings\"\nINNER JOIN \"security_scans\" ON \"security_findings\".\"scan_id\" = \"security_scans\".\"id\"\nINNER JOIN \"ci_builds\" ON \"security_scans\".\"build_id\" = \"ci_builds\".\"id\"\nWHERE \"ci_builds\".\"type\" = 'Ci::Build' AND \"ci_builds\".\"commit_id\" = 5\n```\n\nThis also affects `Pipeline#has_security_findings?` which is used in other places.\n\n### Options\n\n1.
