Part of the assumed risk with this work is potentially providing more attack surface by exposing the detected secrets within the report artifacts. This was considered not significant for a couple reasons:\n\n1. Job Artifact permissions should remain restricted as-is, assuming our standard permission model\n1. While not explicitly including the secret currently, the security reports are already clear evidence of RED classified data and should be assumed to contain confidential data\n1. The secrets are already leaked within the repository itself. This remains unchanged with this modification.\n\n### Documentation\n\n1. Update security-report-schema with new field\n1. Consider updating security integration docs with new field\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n1. Update integration tests projects\n1.

an issue is critical for when an issue was created with the wrong type. Or perhaps, you meant to create an issue but after some discussion, you've decided that the matter needs to be escalated. In that scenario, you can change it from an issue to an incident so that it can be escalated appropriately. Change the type of an issue by clicking on the edit button in the upper right hand corner of an issue. Select the new type from the type drop-down and click save.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html\n\n![Image](/uploads/f6f7f3a1e3442fb54600f5d878b86a5f/Screen_Shot_2021-01-21_at_1.52.31_PM.png)\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nUsers want the ability to change the type of issues after creation. Perhaps they accidentally created the issue unaware of available types or simply made a mistake. Some may also have created an issue and then realize it actually needs to be \"promoted\" to an incident.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n\n### User experience goal\nAllow people to change the issue type so that they can recover if they've created the wrong one.\n\n### Proposal\n\nHelp people change the issue type once the issue or incident is created\n\nWhen someone clicks the edit button on issues -

This should be the timestamp that the first commit in the MR was created (we can use `merge_request_metrics.first_commit_at`).  Although this excludes the time that the developer spent creating the changes captured in the commit, this event could serve as a rough proxy for the beginning of the \"code\" stage.

Usage of Jira Connect application with Self-hosted GitLab","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe [GitLab for Jira application on the Atlassian Connect marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?hosting=cloud\u0026tab=overview) works primarily with GitLab.com, but _it is possible_ to get it working with self-hosted GitLab instances.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe \"application\" itself is simply an iframe of a view of GitLab.com, and the routes are defined via the `app descriptor` which is at `https://gitlab.com/-/jira_connect/app_descriptor`. This application **can only** work with GitLab.com, because it is quite literally GitLab.com itself.\n\nThere are two (current) methods which allow you to use this same functionality with your own self-hosted GitLab instance:\n\n1. Put Jira in \"dev mode\", which allows you to enter the URL for the app descriptor manually\n1. Publish a \"private\" application, pointing to that app descriptor\n\nBy pointing to your self-hosted app descriptor, the Jira instance communicates with that GitLab installation instead of GitLab.com. Either method works equally well, with caveats on both sides:\n\n1. There is some user objection and wariness about putting their Jira installation in \"dev mode\". Some view this as a potential problem, though this is primarily a misunderstanding of what the mode does. \n1. Using a private listing still requires approval from the Atlassian marketplace, which can take up to two weeks to complete\n\n[These docs seem to cover the required steps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started/), and could be modified and condensed to fit our specific needs. They also clearly show that the setting required to be enabled for _both_ methods is in the same UI.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should:\n\n1. Document these two methods of installation on docs.gitlab.com\n1. Amend our [application listing page](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?hosting=cloud\u0026tab=overview) to point to these docs\n\n### Who can address the issue\n\n@eread \n\n### Other links/references\n\n`Development mode` workaround originally noted by @engwan here: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1626#note_230478579\n\n\u003c!-- E.g. related GitLab issues/MRs --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-16T13:44:54.452Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:56:18.138Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T15:47:32.342Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Deliverable","Integration::Jira","Jira::ConnectApp","Technical Writing","atlassian","backend","devops::manage","docs-only","documentation","group::ecosystem [DEPRECATED]","missed-deliverable","missed:13.7","priority::1","section::dev","tw::doing","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},{"id":5133434,"username":"aqualls","name":"Amy Qualls","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5133434/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aqualls"}],"author":{"id":3646819,"username":"deuley","name":"Patrick Deuley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3646819/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/deuley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/268278","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/268278","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/268278/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/268278/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#268278","relative":"#268278","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#268278"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5399,"epic":{"id":203447,"iid":5399,"title":"GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app should support GitLab self-managed instances","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5399","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72836028,"iid":268269,"project_id":278964,"title":"Redis HLL tracking -\u003e Adjust the controller/helpers methods to accept plan parameter","description":"Adjust the controller/helpers methods to accept plan parameter\n\n* [ ] Adjust controller concern\n* [ ] Adjust API helper\n* [ ] Update related docs\n\n### Notes\n\nFor tracking events based on Redis HLL on plan level, this would make sense for gitlab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-16T13:09:01.701Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T20:39:15.888Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T20:39:15.870Z","closed_by":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::growth","group::product intelligence","missed:13.11","missed:13.6","product intelligence","section::growth","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/268018 we added a `message` param to allow creation of annotated Git tags.

Something like:\n\n```\nexplain SELECT COUNT(\"services\".\"id\")\nFROM \"services\"\nWHERE \"services\".\"active\" = TRUE\n  AND \"services\".\"project_id\" IS NOT NULL\n  AND \"services\".\"type\" = 'SlackService'\n  AND \"services\".\"inherit_from_id\" IS NOT NULL\n  AND \"services\".\"id\" BETWEEN 0 AND 99999;\n```\n\nThis is fast enough, today.\n\n```\nTime: 12.035 ms\n  - planning: 0.365 ms\n  - execution: 11.670 ms\n    - I/O read: 7.522 ms\n    - I/O write: 0.000 ms\n\nShared buffers:\n  - hits: 307 (~2.40 MiB) from the buffer pool\n  - reads: 6 (~48.00 KiB) from the OS file cache, including disk I/O\n  - dirtied: 78 (~624.00 KiB)\n  - writes: 0\n```\n\nThe query plan uses `index_services_on_inherit_from_id` instead of the new index, hence the complex filter is used. But this is not a problem as long as `inherit_from_id IS NOT NULL` rows are small.\n\n```\n Aggregate  (cost=3.45..3.46 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=11.608..11.609 rows=1 loops=1)\n   Buffers: shared hit=307 read=6 dirtied=78\n   I/O Timings: read=7.522\n   -\u003e  Index Scan using index_services_on_inherit_from_id on public.services  (cost=0.42..3.45 rows=1 width=4) (actual time=11.602..11.602 rows=0 loops=1)\n         Index Cond: (services.inherit_from_id IS NOT NULL)\n         Filter: (services.active AND (services.project_id IS NOT NULL) AND (services.id \u003e= 0) AND (services.id \u003c= 99999) AND ((services.type)::text = 'SlackService'::text))\n         Rows Removed by Filter: 433\n         Buffers: shared hit=307 read=6 dirtied=78\n         I/O Timings: read=7.522\n```\n\nI'm assuming that `inherit_from_id` was recently added for the new feature - Group-level service integration, and therefore the row count is low (today, it's 547 out of 664806). This also means that the count will grow as the usage expands, and it slowly pressurizes the query performance.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-16T11:06:44.637Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:56:21.510Z","closed_at":"2021-03-30T18:35:25.135Z","closed_by":{"id":3753003,"username":"cdu1","name":"Chun

Not necessarily, however, those things should happen all at once and right when the page gets loaded. This issue suggests to load only the components, essential for the initial load. And that would be only `IdeSidebar`.\n\n## What about the remaining components? :thinking: \n\nThe remaining components should be converted into [the asynchronously loaded ones](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components). Meaning those will be loaded and bootstrapped only when they have to be output on the screen. Following this idea, components that are not essential for the initial loading but are not \"protected\" by `v-if` condition like:\n\n  - `ide-status-bar`\n  - `new-modal`\n  - `find-file`\n  - etc.\n\nshould be wrapped in a new condition and the condition defaulting to `false`. The condition should be triggered to `true` only after the navigation tree has been rendered.\n \n## Benefits\n\nBy loading fewer components on the initial load we will not only benefit from fewer bytes sent to the user right from the start, but also will see the real performance benefits. Here are the performance numbers. The measurements are taken for `http://127.0.0.1:3000/-/ide/project/gnuwget/wget2/edit/master` URL in the local development environment running 5 consecutive loads. The numbers are simply for comparison:\n\n### Before\n\n#### DOM METRICS\n| Parameter | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Run 4 | Run 5 | Average |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| DOM Content Loaded | 2316 | 1484 | 1257 | 965 | 1097 | **1423.8** |\n| DOM Complete | 2814 | 1623 | 1317 | 993 | 1265 | **1602.4** |\n| DOM Interactive | 938 | 627 | 898 | 591 | 618 | **734.4** |\n\n#### CUSTOM METRICS \u0026 MEASUREMENTS\n| Parameter | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Run 4 | Run 5 | Average |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| webide-tree-loading-from-request | 8283 | 4244 | 3879 | 3862 | 4244 | **4902.4** |\n| webide-tree-within-app | 5038 | 2750 | 2614 | 2889 | 3141 | **3286.4** |\n| webide-tree-self | 2437 | 2221 | 2003 | 2281 | 2576 | **2303.6** |\n\n### After\n\n#### DOM METRICS\n| Parameter | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Run 4 | Run 5 | Average |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| DOM Content Loaded | 2147 | 1308 | 1048 | 1032 | 968 | **1300.6** |\n| DOM Complete | 2491 | 1465 | 1226 | 1100 | 992 | **1454.8** |\n| DOM Interactive | 1029 | 681 | 701 | 707 | 549 | **733.4** |\n\n#### CUSTOM METRICS \u0026 MEASUREMENTS\n| Parameter | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Run 4 | Run 5 | Average |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| webide-tree-loading-from-request | 5941 | 5227 | 3667 | 3793 | 3490 | **4423.6** |\n| webide-tree-within-app | 2893 | 3876 | 2592 | 2677 | 2498 | **2907.2** |\n| webide-tree-self | 2046 | 2065 | 2046 | 2199 | 1988 | **2068.8** |\n\n## Unwanted (but tolerable) side-effects.\n\nBy not loading `repo-editor` component right from the start (since it's behind the `v-if` condition) loading a file after clicking it in the navigation tree might feel _a little bit_ slower than usual. This, however, is affecting only the very first load of any file — the consecutive opening of the files will not be affected and will be the same as nowadays.\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nPlease run `package-and-qa` to ensure all tests still pass. Unlikely, but still possible that we might need to adjust waiting times in automation if files are loading slower than expected.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-16T08:33:18.091Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T11:43:30.931Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T08:08:46.275Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

A Sitemap file located at http://example.com/catalog/sitemap.xml can include any URLs starting with http://example.com/catalog/ but can not include URLs starting with http://example.com/images/.\n\nAlso, in [Google's General sitemap guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?ref_topic=4581190):\n\n\u003e A sitemap can be posted anywhere on your site, but a sitemap affects only descendants of the parent directory. Therefore, a sitemap posted at the site root can affect all files on the site, which is where we recommend posting your sitemaps.\n\nTherefore, we need to make available the top-level route `/sitemap.xml` and `/sitemap.xml.gz` (in case we want to serve it compressed).\n\nThis might affect namespaces with the path `sitemap.xml` but we need to make it available. We can make up a custom sitemap name almost impossible to collide with existing namespaces but it's better to use the default name because most of the time that default route is used to discover it and we use a made-up one it won't be possible.\n\nThe general idea is to use the `sitemap.xml` file as an index and the place any other necessary sitemaps in `/public/-/sitemaps/` accessible by the url `/-/sitemaps`. Since the top-level route `-` is already forbidden, we won't have any problem.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-16T07:01:18.164Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T10:43:58.845Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T07:32:11.817Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco

gitlab servers to spam huge emails","description":"**[HackerOne report #1009040](https://hackerone.com/reports/1009040)** by `yvvdwf` on 2020-10-15, assigned to @rchan-gitlab:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\nEach project setting has *Emails on push* service integration. The service allows to email the commits and diff of each push to a list of recipients.  \nThe problem is that there are no verification, neither limitation about the recipients.  \nAttackers may use this feature to spam (or promote their projects as reported in [25994](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25994)).\n\nFurthermore I strongly belive that attackers may cause DoS on gitlab servers when using a huge list of recipients since there are no limitation of recipients\u0026#39; size.\n\n\nIndeed the emails are sending by [app/workers/emails_on_push_worker.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9138d41b1c9f35de2183ace684582477acd354b9/app/workers/emails_on_push_worker.rb):  \n```ruby  \n    valid_recipients(recipients).each do |recipient|  \n      send_email(  \n        recipient,  \n        project_id,  \n        author_id:                 author_id,  \n        ref:                       ref,  \n        action:                    action,  \n        compare:                   compare,  \n        reverse_compare:           reverse_compare,  \n        diff_refs:                 diff_refs,  \n        send_from_committer_email: send_from_committer_email,  \n        disable_diffs:             disable_diffs  \n      )  \n```\n\n`valid_recipients` function does nothing but split the recipients by space:  \n```ruby  \n  def valid_recipients(recipients)  \n    recipients.split.select do |recipient|  \n      recipient.include?(\u0026#39;@\u0026#39;)  \n    end  \n  end  \n```\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a new project or use the one existing, then goto *Settings/Integarations/Emails on push*  \n2. Check on *Active, Push, Tag Push*  \n3. Enter a huge list of emails into *Recipients* textbox. Separate emails by space  \n4. Hit *Test Settings*\n\nGitlab will send emails to all emails in the recipients\u0026#39; list.\n\nI\u0026#39;ve not tested on gitlab.com but on my local installation using google mail to send emails.   \nFortunately, google detected spaming and stoped sending emails after sending some.\n\n#####  Impact\n\n- Allow attackers to use gitlab servers to spam email or promote their projects  \n- Cause DoS on gitlab servers\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNumber of emails in the recipients is not limited\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNumber of emails in the recipients should be limited\n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:  \n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)  \n```  \nSystem information  \nSystem:\t\tUbuntu 18.04  \nProxy:\t\tno  \nCurrent User:\tgit  \nUsing RVM:\tno  \nRuby Version:\t2.6.6p146  \nGem Version:\t2.7.10

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nEnsure test coverage in unit/integration tests, no end-to-end test is required.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels if you can figure out the correct ones --\u003e\n\n---\n### Feature Flag\n\nWe're working on refactoring filtered search on boards to use GraphQL.

In GitLab 13.7, we have introduced user provisioning for SAML-enabled groups. When a user logs into a SAML-enabled group for the first time, a user account will be created for them automatically if there's not an existing user with the same email. SAML provisioning improves the onboarding experience for new users and ensures that the account created contains the right information. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/#user-access-and-management\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nSome groups are using IdPs that don't support SCIM but they want the benefits of automated account creation. We implemented this for Group Managed Accounts in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9153 but this functionality would be useful for all groups. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nAccounts are created easily and with the right information.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMake the functionality built for GMA available to all groups.\n\n* The group administrator must enable this option.\n* We have a default mapping for attributes like what was built for GMA https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/group_managed_accounts.html#assertions \n* If we get a SAML request that contains an email that matches an existing GitLab account, we ask the user to log into that account. The username is read-only and we ask the user to enter the password for that account.\n* If we see a SAML request that contains an email that doesn't match an existing GitLab account, we create one using the details in the assertion.\n   * We set a password as we do for SCIM accounts.\n   * If we have a username conflict, we use the same logic that we use for SCIM to generate a new username.\n* Users created by JIT should receive the same email as SCIM provisioned users: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276018\n\nThe high-level flow should be:\n* If this SAML identity is already mapped, then log the user in.\n* If a GitLab account exists that has a verified email that matches that in the SAML assertion, then ask the user to log in with that account. After login, the account will be linked to that SAML identity.\n* If a GitLab account doesn't exist that has a verified email that matches that in the SAML assertion, then create the account using the details in SAML. \n* Tie the user to the group that provisioned the account. \n* After login, the user will be linked to that SAML identity.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis functionality exists in [GMA](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/group_managed_accounts.html#assertions). The difference is that we should not have a flow where we make existing accounts become managed. \n\nThis functionality also exists in [self-managed SAML](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/saml.html#general-setup). \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python - when analyzing a `pipenv` project removes the existing python environment and reinstalls everything.\n\nThis is because it uses a `--python` parameter - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/master/pkgmngr/pipenv.go#L31\n\nThis may cause additional network traffic for large projects, and pre-cached packages in an airgapped network would be ignored with the new environment trying to install from pypi.\n\nThis is noted in an closed issue raised against pipenv - https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/349#issuecomment-340003549\n\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Spin up the Gemnasium Python container eg. `docker run --privileged -it --entrypoint sh registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2`\n1. Bring down a pipenv project eg. `git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv.git`\n1. cd to `python-pipenv`\n1. Bring down dependencies `apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get install -y iptables libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev`\n1. Install `pipenv install`\n1. Lock down the container eg. `iptables -P INPUT DROP \u0026\u0026 iptables -P OUTPUT DROP`\n1. Install `pipenv install` is successful\n1. Run analyzer `export SECURE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to see what it is doing and `/analyzer run`\n1. Note in output that the environment is removed \n```\nVirtualenv already exists!\nRemoving existing virtualenv...\nCreating a virtualenv for this project...\n```\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGemnasium Python pipenv reinstalls the environment even if already populated\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIdeally if the pipenv environment is already installed and populated, it should use what is there, or at least give the user an option (environment variable etc.) of whether to reinstall this or not.\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to

is to specify the path to python executable using `PIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION` as documented at https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipenv.environments.PIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION\n\nQuick, dirty and nasty workaround is to copy `/usr/local/bin/pipenv` (eg. `pipenvbak`) and have a script to pass through, ignoring the `--python` parameter\n\n```\n# cat /usr/local/bin/pipenv\n\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ $1 = \"install\" ]; then\n  /usr/local/bin/pipenvbak install\nelse\n  /usr/local/bin/pipenvbak $@\nfi\n```\n\n### Implementation\n\nAs per [documentation](), we should set the `PIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION` and make it available to the `pipenv` builder. as a build arg in gemnasium-python's Dockerfile and remove the `--python` argument in the install step.\n\n- [x] add `PIPENV_DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION` build and env args in [Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/blob/master/Dockerfile)\n- [x] remove `--python` argument from the `pipenv` builder in [pipenv builder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/builder/pipenv/pipenv.go)\n- [ ] release new version of `gemnasium`\n- [ ] link new version of [gemnasium submodule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) in `gemnasium-python` (see `./gemnasium`)\n- [ ] release new version of `gemnasium-python`\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] document the new variable under https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-specific-analyzers-used-by-dependency-scanning\n\n### Testing\n\n- [ ] add a test branch in [python-pipenv](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv)) to demonstrate that multiple calls to `/analyzer run` in a project with a `Pipfile` do not cause an environment reinstall (either by checking log or by checking the environment itself)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-15T17:09:03.557Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T07:08:45.801Z","closed_at":"2021-03-17T21:11:33.761Z","closed_by":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor

explorations","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nAs an agent \"owner\", I want a way to allow the agent access to manifest projects, without me personally having access to those projects.\n\nAs a manifest project owner, I want a way to allow the agent access to my manifest project, without allowing read access to others.\n\n## Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n## User experience goal\n\nBe able to allow access to a specific agent in a project's settings.\n\n## Proposal\n\nUse deploy tokens to authorize an agent to access the a private manifest project.\n\nAssuming that Priyanka manages the agent configuration project, and Sasha manages the manifest project, the user flow is the following:\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n1. Priyanka set up the agent configuration project, and installs the agent\n1. Sasha creates the manifest project\n\nAuthorization and deployment setup:\n\n1. Sasha creates a deploy token under \"Settings/Repository/Deploy Tokens\"\n1. Sasha shares the deploy token credentials (username + password) with Priyanka, outside of GitLab\n1. Priyanka registers the deploy token credentials under a UI of the config project\n   - A single agent configuration project might include the configuration of multiple agents. The deploy token should be registered for the selected agents only.\n   - The authorization in step 3 may expose the existence of private projects, or private groups as GitLab will show the full path of the project to Priyanka.\n1. Priyanka adds the manifest project slug to the agent configuration yaml\n\nAn optimization of the above might be to have a UI for steps 3 and 4 together. That is when Priyanka registers the deploy token, a new branch + commit + MR (or a commit on master directly) are automatically created that add the manifest project to the agent configuration.\n\n### Documentation\n\n**Security note** During authorization of manifest projects for a cluster agent, GitLab may expose the existence of private projects, and private groups to the maintainers of the configuration project.\n\n### TBC: Should GitLab show the full path of the config project to Sasha ?\n\n### Constraints\n\n1. All private groups (names, paths) remain private only to their members\n1. All private projects (names, paths) remain private only to their members\n1. All agents (names, cluster names) remain private only to the config project, and projects that authorized the agent.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nWe've discussed many alternatives, and decided to move on with the approach that uses deploy tokens.\n\nThese alternatives were:\n\n- start with automatically authorizing the configuration project to access itself for manifest files too\n- create a workflow where most of the authorization is done in the manifest repo\n- add support for service accounts to manage the authorizations\n- provide group level agents to allow access to any project under the group\n\nSome of these might be implemented in future issues.\n\n### User story\n\n### Use cases with various private projects\n\nThe basic approach is the one recommended by Emily when adding the project should happen in the config project, and it might notify the manifest project's maintainers.\n\nCurrently we have 3 proposals that complement each other:\n\n- Shipping \"Use case 0\" described next\n- Adding support for group level agents: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/283885\n- **Using deploy tokens for authorization of private manifest projects**: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/268019#note_446183623\n\nThe proposal in this issue is the last one: authorization using deploy tokens.\n\n#### Use case 0\n\n```\nGiven that user has a single, private project to store the agent configuration and manifests\nWhen the user updates the manifests in the project\nThen the agent can read the manifests without any further user setup and authorization\n```\n\n#### Use case 1\n\n```\nGiven that user has a public/internal agent configuration project in group A\nand a user has a public/internal manifest project in group A\nWhen the user adds the manifest project to the configuration project\nThen we can already support this setup\n```\n\n:white_check_mark: This is already supported\n\n#### Use case 2\n\n```\nGiven that user has a private agent configuration project in group A\nand a user has a public/internal manifest project in group A\nWhen the user adds the manifest project to the configuration project\nThen we can already support this setup\n```\n\n:white_check_mark: This is already supported\n\n#### Use case 3\n\n```\nGiven that user Alfred has a private agent configuration project in group A\nand user Bill has a private manifest project in group A\nWhen Alfred adds the manifest project to the agent configuration\nThen Bill receives an e-mail to authorize the agent\nWhen Bill authorizes the agent\nThen the agent can access the manifest project\nAnd the agent shows up on the manifest project as being authorized\nAnd the agent's authorization can be reoved on the manifest project page\nWhen Bill does not authorize the agent\nThen nothing is changed, nobody is notified any further\n```\n\n:question: Based on the discussions until now, we seem to converge here.

Please, let me know if I misunderstood something.\n\n```\nGiven that user Alfred has a private agent configuration project in group A\nand user Bill has a private manifest project in group B\nWhen Alfred adds the manifest project to the agent configuration\nThen we notify Alfred that crossing groups is not allowed.\n```\n\n```\nGiven that user Alfred has a public/internal agent configuration project in group A\nand user Bill has a private manifest project in group B\nWhen Alfred adds the manifest project to the agent configuration\nThen we notify Alfred that crossing groups is not allowed.\n```\n\n```\nGiven that user has a group level agent configuration project in group A\nand a user has a private manifest project in group A\nWhen the user adds the manifest project to the configuration project\nThen we notify the user that crossing groups is not allowed.\n```\n\n```\nGiven that user has a group level agent configuration project in group A\nand a user has a public manifest project in group B\nWhen the user adds the manifest project to the configuration project\nThen we notify the user that crossing groups is not allowed.\n```\n\n## Moving manifest projects around\n\nOne option is here to keep \"security boundaries are hard\", and loose the authorization when a manifest project is moved to a different group.\n\nAnother option is to allow some kind of migration. Let's keep it simple, and **start with restricting ourselved to hard security boundaries.**\n\n:question: What do you think about this *simplification*?\n\nI'm trying to describe various use cases following the question [what happens if the user later looses access to the manifest project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/268019#note_437467456)\n\n```\nGiven that the user has a configuration project in group A\nand the user has a manifest project in group A\nand the user is a member of group B\nWhen the manifest project is moved to group B\nThen the user has to update the configuration project with the group B path of the manifest project\nAnd ... do we need re-authorization or not?\n...\n```\n\n```\nGiven that the user has a configuration project in group A\nand the user has a manifest project in group A\nand the user is not a member of group B\nWhen the manifest project is moved to group B\n...\n```\n\n```\nGiven that the user has a configuration project in group A\nand the user has a manifest project in group A\nWhen the user leaves the company\n...\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-15T14:44:31.677Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T14:03:33.594Z","closed_at":"2022-01-22T14:03:33.580Z","closed_by":{"id":4545061,"username":"nagyv-gitlab","name":"Viktor Nagy (GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb255c1e9c228b9356af165939b3ac9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nagyv-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Kubernetes Management","UX","devops::configure","group::configure","missed:13.7","section::ops","security","type::feature","workflow::problem validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This enables you to include relevant information along with the new tag so downstream users and application can have additional context.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nIt is now possible to create automated releases from CI jobs, because the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` gives access to the Releases POST API, either manually (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2510#note_278101632) or with the `release` job parameter (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#release).\n\nHowever, although one can create a tag with this, it looks like only lightweight tags are allowed.

Pick an issue and assign yourself if you currently are not assigned.\n1. Preparation:\n   1. Figure out on which pages your CSS is used, note down the HAML files. Note: Sometimes page specific CSS can be used on multiple pages!\n   1. Move the file from `app/assets/stylesheets/pages` to `app/assets/stylesheets/page_bundles`\n   1. Remove it from `page_specific_files.scss`\n   1. Add the file to `config/application.rb`\n   1. Add `- add_page_specific_style 'page_bundles/example'` to all haml templates you have identified that are using these styles. (available once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43680 lands, in order to drive bias for action you can use `= stylesheet_link_tag 'page_bundles/example'`) for now.\n1. Use CSS variables for all the colors. This is **crucial** for dark mode.\n   1. If a color doesn't have an exact match with [Pajamas colors](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/colors), choose the nearest color from the Pajamas colors. If there isn't an exact match, see whether a dark mode variable is available: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/themes/_dark.scss\n   1. If you have dark-mode related questions, consider pinging `@psimyn`.\n1. Ensure that the changed pages work properly\n1. Merge away!\n\n#### Notes\n\nIn order to quickly get our application.css size down, hold off on any unneeded optimizations, however while you are looking at the page specific styles, you can choose to optimize the following things *or* preferably create follow-up issues:\n\n1. Replacing certain properties with utility classes\n1. Sometimes a page specific CSS might contain classes of *distinct* pages. Then we could split those. (e.g. pipelines css for lists vs pipelines css for details pages)\n1.

I would expect to be able to find the projects in the project dropdown but they're not there, and even if they were this isn't really optimal in a long projects list and I wish the checked projects were automatically hoisted to the top of the list.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nVisit https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/security/vulnerabilities/?state=DETECTED\u0026projectId=278964\u0026projectId=2009901\u0026projectId=554859\u0026projectId=14022\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/security/vulnerabilities/?state=DETECTED\u0026projectId=278964\u0026projectId=2009901\u0026projectId=554859\u0026projectId=14022\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen I visit the link above, I have to figure out which projects are included in the dashboard based on the IDs in the URL.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMinimal: Selected projects should appear in the projects dropdown\nIdeal: Selected projects should be at the top of the projects dropdown\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nI'm going to suggest a two step implementation here in order to deliver value to the user faster. The first one is fixing the bug:\n\n- [ ] ~frontend ~bug It seems like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/filters/standard_filter.vue#L68 defines the selected options on mount and then stops being reactive. The issue with the project filters is that we fetch the list of projects on runtime. We fetch them when they're required. Therefore, somehow we need to make sure the data is updated and `selectedOptions` reflect this change.\n- [ ] ~frontend ~feature Once we fix the issue above, we can start altering the `standard_filter`. We can use the `\u003cgl-dropdown-divider /\u003e` component to add a divider between selected projects and unselected projects. We'll have to sort them by their status. As this is only required for the projects filter, perhaps we can use a property which uses the divider only when it's needed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-15T13:42:37.345Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:05:41.952Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T10:13:12.288Z","closed_by":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","design-weight::2","devops::secure","frontend","group::threat insights","section::sec","security dashboard","type::maintenance","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"}],"author":{"id":4992072,"username":"dcouture","name":"Dominic Couture","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4992072/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dcouture"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/268012","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/268012","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/268012/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/268012/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#268012","relative":"#268012","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#268012"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72771766,"iid":268000,"project_id":278964,"title":"[BE] Instance Statistics MVP: Add date constraint parameters to API","description":"Add `fromDate` and `toDate` parameters to the Instance Statistics GraphQL API to mitigate complex calculations on the frontend to figure out whether to fetch more data and what data to fetch.\n\nHere are some examples of the calculations necessary:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44927/diffs#15c5d97d6660121f50ceae05c2f19edc6c202739_0_123\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/44927/diffs#15c5d97d6660121f50ceae05c2f19edc6c202739_0_139\n\n\u003e I assume we can't rely on all data points to be present, which will make it hard to calculate the number of items we need to request.

clicking \"select all\" and \"import selected\" which feels like ok trade-off for me while keeping UI simple and making sure we're not providing too many ways to do the same thing\n\n![image](/uploads/9d51daa4baa9f7bb7e2d05785da8a665/image.png)\n\nAll of this will be done as a part of gitlab-ui component or shared gitlab component and will be communicated to the teams, who might be interested in that (according to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/1444)\n\nOutside of scope for first iteration: \n\n* Adding \"import all on current page\" vs \"import all repositories\"\n\nSince this will require ~backend  support for ~\"group::import\" I will suggest splitting this part to prevent issue growing too big\n\n\n* Select more than one top group to migrate (using checkboxes).\n* CTA should state `Import xx groups`.\n* CTA would be disabled if no groups are selected.\n* CTA would be clickable as long as there are groups selected for import. \n* Clicking the button would be equivalent to clicking all the individual `Import` buttons for each selected group.\n* If an individual import is triggered, that group would no longer be selectable and the `xx` would be updated. \n* If an individual group import is in progress, that group is no longer selectable for `Import all`.\n\n## Out of scope\n* This solution does not implement the ability to import more groups than are visible on the page -

By doing so, we reduce and/or eliminate the frustration when trying to locate details regarding previous imports. \n\n### JTBD\n\nWhen I need to refer back to projects that I've imported, I want the ability to view a list of all my previously imported projects and when they were imported, so that I can verify I've imported all of the intended projects.\n\n### User experience\n\nCreate an intuitive and path-of-least-resistance experience for the user to quickly view the history of the imported projects.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd `History` link to `Import project` page which then links to a `Project import history` page.\n\nThe following columns appear within the `Project import history` list:\n\n- Source\n- Destination\n- Date\n- Status\n![Poject_import_history_-_v5](/uploads/5434966d8278c71d579cc180f9a094c1/Poject_import_history_-_v5.jpg)\n\n[UX Designs for View History of All Project Imports (Figma file) ](https://www.figma.com/file/aC6FEQO86Vk02eAD9kJC0d/267788-History-of-Project-Imports?node-id=1%3A1437)\n\n### Release notes\n\nThe new **Project import history** page shows the view of all project imports, regardless of where they were imported from.

For additional context see https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4610 \n\nTo do we would:\n\n* Give the user options to copy, download or print codes.\n* Don't allow users to leave setup until they've clicked on one of the options.\n* Add an [alert](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-alert--default) that says \"Please copy, download, or print your recovery codes before proceeding\"\n* For gitlab.com, can we track clicks for each of these buttons?\n\nCurrent experience:\n\n![image](/uploads/cbbfe7eedd2364faf6db87bf0fcad0d2/image.png)\n\n## Technical approach\n\n- Replace [app/views/profiles/two_factor_auths/_codes.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/profiles/two_factor_auths/_codes.html.haml) with a Vue app that uses [app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/clipboard_button.vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/clipboard_button.vue) for the copy button and `window.print()` for the print button. The Vue app will use local state to determine if the user has clicked one of the buttons (download, copy, or print). Once clicked the \"Proceed\" button will become enabled.\n- Use [Vue tracking mixin](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/product_analytics/snowplow.html#tracking-within-vue-components) to track button clicks\n\n## Analytics tracking\n\nThis has been setup to track all of the button clicks.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nWhen you are reviewing a Merge Request and see there are Code Quality violations introduced you may want to help the author by pointing out how they can resolve those. Today this involves having multiple windows open to see the violations on the Merge Request summary and another reviewing the changes in the MR or your IDE. After going back and forth trying to find what the problem is you give up and just go back to reviewing the change but ignoring those new violations.\n\nNow you can see right in the Merge Request diff view if the file you are reviewing has new code quality violations that are part of this change. This gives you the context to suggest a fix as part of your normal workflow within GitLab without having to keep more windows open and context switch back and forth between them.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a code reviewer, I want to see on the Changes tab of an MR if a modified file has code quality violations, so I can click back to the CQ MR widget only when needed and stay focused on improving the quality of this change.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - Who is doing a code review on another developer's MR and wants to see how new code quality violations impact the overall project.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to see in the MR Diff view if one of the files modified in this merge request has a changed code quality violation.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* If a file in the MR Diff view has a code quality entry in the MR Widget add a [badge](https://design.gitlab.com/components/badge#linked-badges) with some helper text of \"The merge request has been updated, and the number of code quality violations in this file changed.\"\n* Link the badge so it navigates to the merge request main page widget in a single click OR open that modal on this page.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Add to the existing documentation page that Code Quality notifications now appear on the Changes tab of a Merge Request. Doesn't need to include a screenshot until we have the fully rolled out feature.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n* Documentation is written about what needs to be uploaded on source/target branch pipelines to invoke the feature\n* Barebones documentation about the feature is in place to reduce deletions when full feature is present\n* When a source file has a new or resolved code quality violation there is a badge/treatment about that on the MR Diff View\n\n#### Measures of success\n* None for this - full measures of success of this feature are noted in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2526\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly.

Users can see this information in the form of a clickable link when viewing a vulnerability's details. The link will take the user directly to the file and line number inside the repository for the default branch. This same information is also displayed on the Vulnerability Report. However, the file names were not clickable, requiring that you open a vulnerability's details page to access the link.\n\nThis enhancement brings the convenience of linked filenames to the Vulnerability Report. From a Project, Group, or Security Center Vulnerability Report, you can go directly to the affected file and line number from any vulnerability reported from a scanner which outputs this information. Because you no longer need to first open each vulnerability record, it is much faster to do things like open multiple referenced lines of code in separate tabs for speedy triage.\n\n![vulnerability_report_clickable_file_links](/uploads/3540591c77a91c51495d878f47212070/vulnerability_report_clickable_file_links.png)\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/\n\n### Further Details\n\nOn the security dashboard, the file path and line number of a vulnerability is shown as monospaced text:\n\n||\n|-|\n|![ksnip_20201013-214020](/uploads/dacefec08d32dd3072f2d4df1f270f10/ksnip_20201013-214020.png)|\n\nHowever, this is just plain text. To actually view the file with the correct line number, the user needs to click on the vulnerability to view its details, then click on the link in the details view:\n\n||\n|-|\n|![ksnip_20201013-214140](/uploads/e2009f9f9f6a6e91906d5ef8021dcf52/ksnip_20201013-214140.png)|\n\nThis is an extra step that's annoying when dealing with multiple vulnerabilities. We should make the following changes:\n\n1. Make the monospaced text on the vulnerability list a link as well.\n\n2. Change the `file/path/file.ext (line: 83)` text to `file/path/file.ext:83` to match how it's shown in other places, i.e. the details view as shown in the second screenshot above.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n~backend #267521\n\n1. GraphQL: Add `blobPath` (suggesting the name because maybe having it match the field on the vulnerability details page makes sense?) field to `VulnerabilityLocation` types \n\n~frontend (weight: 2)\n\n1. Within `vulnerability.fragment.graphql` \n   * add `blobPath` to `VulnerabilityLocation` inline fragments\n2. Within `vulnerability_list.vue`\n   * Remove `class=\"monospace\"` from div that wraps the vulnerability path item\n   * Wrap the `gl-truncate` instance that displays the `item.location` in a `gl-link` with the `href` set to the `item.blobPath` \n   * Update `createLocationString` to display `${file}:${startLine}`\n3.

The GCS/S3 offers a way to use this sha256 in some cases.\n\nkamil  18 hours ago\n As for the cache key, you can just use URL without query parameters - it will be uniq per deployment\nI tried that. This is pretty complex to get right. As URL does not tell you anything about the content. You assume that URL is unique, which is in most cases, but this is kind of clumsy as well :slightly_smiling_face:\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-14T04:02:30.428Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T16:33:13.660Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T16:33:13.623Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Pages","Pages::Object Storage","Release::P1","backend","cicd::active","devops::release","feature::enhancement","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"}],"author":{"id":4082686,"username":"jaime","name":"Jaime Martinez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4082686/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jaime"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267495","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/267495","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/267495/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/267495/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#267495","relative":"#267495","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#267495"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3906,"epic":{"id":81057,"iid":3906,"title":"Deploy pages zip archives to object storage/local storage when pages are deployed","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3906","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
