In the same way that it is helpful to have multiple assignees for an issue, it would be very helpful for multiple assignees fro merge requests.\n\nAdditionally, when reviewing a large merge request, it is not uncommon for multiple people to be reviewing the merge request at the same time. Assigning oneself is helpful for indicating which people are reviewing the merge request.\n\n### Target audience\n\n- Delaney, Development Team Lead, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas#delaney-development-team-lead\n\n- Sasha, Software Developer, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas#sasha-software-developer\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eOriginal description\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\nIf we will be extending this feature to merge requests following the implementation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1904 we should think about showing `not allowed to merge slightly different`\n\nthis was an answer to a question from @ClemMakesApps here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1904#note_25975510\n\n---\n\ncoming from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4175 (way back :smile: )\n\n\u003e We currently allow a MR to be assigned to any project member, regardless of role. This can be useful. For example, if the master role reviews the MR and requires changes of the developer, the MR can be reassigned to the developer while changes are in process. However, it is also possible that the MR gets assigned to a member with the intention of having them merge it. The assigner would have no immediate indication they had assigned the MR to someone that can't actually merge it. It would be nice to have some small indicator that you've assigned the MR to someone that can't merge to the target branch.\n\n![Bitmap_Copy](/uploads/fb954726596cdf5c3ad30043fef1ee84/Bitmap_Copy.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

access to group by IP address","description":"### Description\n\n[Documentation on the implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#restrict-group-access-by-ip-address)\n\nAs an organization, I'd like to make sure only certain people can access my content.\n\nIf I use a VPN or internal network, as an extra layer of security, I would like to be able to restrict content by IP address.\n\nThis has been inspired by the exact same feature at BitBucket: https://blog.bitbucket.org/2017/02/28/big-strides-cloud-security-ip-whitelisting-required-2-step-verification-bitbucket/\n\n### Solution\n\nAdd a `Restrict access by IP address` section to Group General Settings.\n\n![settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/38fc8e6d6c08158733ee67497c945877/settings.png)\n\nInside this section, there will be a text field where users can specify an IP address range. The copy will be:\n\n- Title: 'Restrict access by IP address'\n- Placeholder: 'Enter IP address range'\n- Help text: 'This group, including all subgroups, projects and git repositories, will only be reachable from the specified IP address range. Example: `192.168.0.0/24`. [Read more]()'\n\n'Read more' link TBD.\n\nThis new setting will be available for all visibility levels (Public, Internal, Private)\n\n#### Subgroups\n\nIf a group sets the restriction, all it subgroups will inherit it. The restriction will be displayed in the subgroup's settings:\n\n![subgroup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/d3fc20df8f30768d08d253e1aeb1cb32/subgroup.png)\n\nThe text field will show the IP range set by the parent and will be disabled. A new help text line will be added with the copy:\n\n\u003e This restriction has been set by a parent group.\n\n#### Accessing a restricted page\n\nWhen users try to access a restricted page from the wrong IP address, they will get a `404 Not Found` error as this is our default way of handling restricted content.\n\n### Original proposal\n\nAllow restriction of IP address on the group level in the UI and for git activity. This to ensure this feature will work on GitLab.com as well as on self-hosted instances.\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Documentation blurb\n\nTo make sure only people from within your organisation can access particular content or code, you have the option to restrict access to groups and their underlying projects, issues, etc, by IP address. This can help ensure that particular code doesn't leave the premises, while not blocking off access to the entire instance.\n\nAdd whitelisted IP addresses to the group settings and anyone coming from a different IP address won't be able to access the restricted content.\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-03-22T13:56:50.339Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T15:32:59.686Z","closed_at":"2019-06-17T20:10:45.245Z","closed_by":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Manage [DEPRECATED]","backend","customer","customer+","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","group::authentication and authorization","planning priority","priority::1","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":693518,"iid":33,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.0","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/06/22/gitlab-12-0-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:47:37.975Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T19:51:03.475Z","due_date":"2019-06-22","start_date":"2019-05-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/33"},"assignees":[{"id":563185,"username":"cperessini","name":"Chris Peressini","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/563185/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cperessini"},{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre Farkas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4dcfa5185b8513751b447d76b069bf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifarkas"}],"author":{"id":5497,"username":"JobV","name":"Job van der Voort","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e1e9ffdda52d8c519ac5c49929d7dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JobV"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":563185,"username":"cperessini","name":"Chris Peressini","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/563185/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cperessini"},"user_notes_count":68,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":20,"downvotes":1,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1985","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1985","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1985/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1985/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1985","relative":"#1985","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#1985"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":84,"epic":{"id":151,"iid":84,"title":"Improved group and team access control","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/84","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":4813427,"iid":1976,"project_id":278964,"title":"Re-word Board to Boards in navigation","description":"### Resources\nFE @lbennett \n\n### Description\nIn EE we have multiple boards.

GitLab only supports selecting users (and groups) who can approve the change and a minimum number of approvals required. In this structure it is impossible to enforce the sign off structure in the example above.\n\nThis feature is supported by Phabricator by being able to mark a reviewer as \"blocking\" and is also supported by BitBucket. GitLab should support blocking approver groups so that organizations can be sure the right people review each change.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eOriginal description\u003c/summary\u003e\nWe currently use phabricator for our code reviews, and one of the more useful features it has is the ability to mark a reviewer as \"blocking\", meaning the change is not ready to be released until that specific person approves it.\nThis is extremely important and useful to us, because our release workflow for one of our products requires changes to be signed off on by at least one person from two or more groups.\nGitlab supports approval groups now, but no way to add multiple groups to a review; nor does it have the ability to mark a reviewer as blocking.\n\nThe proposal to add blocking comments kinda would work for this, but honestly, it's not an ideal solution. \n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nExtend the approval model to support multiple **rules**, where a **project** may have $`n`$ rules, where a **rule** is:\n\n- a list of users and groups – $`\\mathbb{R}_{a}`$ is the set of explicit approvers for rule $`a`$\n- a minimum number of approvals — $`m_{a}`$ is the number of required approvers for rule $`a`$\n\nEach eligible approver who approves the merge request approves the merge request in it's entirety. That is, approvers do not check off each rule one by one, instead they approve the merge request as a whole. This means: when a person who is an eligible approver for multiple approval rules, approves the merge request, their approval will be counted towards each approval rule for which they are an eligible approver. Removing their approval of the merge request will remove their approval from every approval rule.\n\nThis will allow the following new behaviors:\n\n- **individual** approvals to be required (`Approval from @user required`) by creating an approval rule with one user and required approval count of one.\n- **group** approvals to be required (`At least n approvals from @group members required`) by creating an approval rule with one group and an approval count of $`n`$\n\nConfigurations:\n\n- **zero approval rules** (Starter, Premium)\n- **one approval rule** (Starter, Premium)\n- **multiple approval rules** (Premium)\n\nInteractions with existing features:\n\n- **Override approvers and approvals required per merge request**\n\n    If enabled the list of approvers and approvals required in an approval rule may be modified.\n\n    Removing approval rules per merge request is not allowed. ~~Project approval rules can be nullified by reducing the approvals required to zero.~~ Required approval counts can only be increased, but not decreased.\n\n    Adding approval rules per merge request is out of scope for this iteration.\n\n- **Enable self approval of merge requests**\n\n    Self approval should continue to function as is.\n\n    If the project approval rules include the merge request author, they will automatically be an eligible approver for one or more rules.\n\n    If the project approval rules do not include the merge request author, they will not be eligible unless added to a merge request approval rule subject to the override approvers feature being enabled.\n\n- **Additional approvals once approvals required have been met**\n\n    This should be reworded 'Additional approvals once **all** approvals required have been met'\n\n### Design\n\n#### Project Settings\n\n| Empty | ~\"GitLab Premium\"  | ~\"GitLab Starter\" |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| ![approvals-settings--empty](/uploads/dd1100ed369284e931e22e644801344a/approvals-settings--empty.png) | ![approvals-settings--ideal](/uploads/7a041830a470f32be759bcba70faf91b/approvals-settings--ideal.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/3f2a3d429dbed716dc9d2d271938105a/image.png) |\n\n| Expanded | Confirm Delete | Mobile |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| ![approvals-settings--expanded](/uploads/5cf59a7502b8d465273276aee5339376/approvals-settings--expanded.png) | ![approvals-settings--confirm-delete](/uploads/fefe1a9035dcd059f5f1946205a5b93f/approvals-settings--confirm-delete.png) | ![approvals-settings--mobile](/uploads/8a193ec4ad5a6b51059ca5c62146c6d1/approvals-settings--mobile.png) |\n\nAll approvals related project settings have been moved to a separate section under `Project Settings → General → Merge request approvals`.\n\n#### Add/Modify approvers\n\n| Add | Modify | Undo removal | Mobile |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| ![approvals-settings--add](/uploads/94bfafaadfbfbb4d4143197bbee30c83/approvals-settings--add.png) | ![approvals-settings--edit](/uploads/231474eb9982d38349dfc65b70753bb4/approvals-settings--edit.png) | ![approvals-settings--remove](/uploads/db6bb1dae8a68b5c5c244e5eea67853c/approvals-settings--remove.png) | ![approvals-settings--mobile-edit](/uploads/d528c31252df70a6d31cadf350adaa50/approvals-settings--mobile-edit.png) |\n\n#### Merge request create/edit form\n\n| Desktop | Mobile |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| ![mr-form](/uploads/7f5f3c8efb7a32373df471d3f754c7ed/mr-form.png) | ![mr-form-mobile](/uploads/b4733966408490e0b6f5871cdfb95293/mr-form-mobile.png) |\n\nOnly the number of approvals required is editable on project-level approval groups.

Managing collapsed files that have already been reviewed can become challenging if the state is not properly remembered after a user refreshes the page. Additionally, users need to be able to track the progress they’ve made after viewing files.\n\nAction: Explore the concept of reducing the size of manually \"collapsed\" files in a Merge Request. Give users the ability to mark files they've already viewed so they are hidden throughout the rest of the code review.\n\nSource: [Dovetail

How to better help users leverage lists in issue descriptions to function as [epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/delivery-vehicles).\n* This can also serve as parent issues.\n\n### Proposed solution\n* This is a continuation of the discussion here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/29444\n* An issue description template that represents an \"epic\" that has a few sections of lists with obvious headings, for example: \"child issues\", or \"dependent issues\", \"blocking issues\",  etc.\n* The epic description template would be stored in the database, similar to the default one here: https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/description_templates#setting-a-default-template-for-issues-and-merge-requests\n* This should _not_ be managed in the repo itself, because we would need it to be usable out of the box, without any set up.\n* The epic description template could then be changed by users in the project settings.\n* This approach would become more obvious to users as this is completed https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/7951.\n* In the future, we would build additional features in the issue description view itself for lists, to delete list items, re-arrange them, etc., without \n* Further off, we could on more native solutions : https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4058.\n\n### Example of an epic issue template\n\n```\n###

JIRA project issues into GitLab project issues","description":"### Description\n\n\n- Import issues from a JIRA project into a GitLab project.\n\n- This feature is _only_ available (as a button, or whatever UI), once you have _already_ set up our existing JIRA project service integration. So that way, we don't have to mess with any weird project set up design / tech things in this issue. The assumption is that the integration is already there and we are building on our existing base.\n\n- So for a qualified GitLab project, anytime you can go into some menu, click a button (or some UI), and then it just dumps a copy of all the JIRA issues into GitLab issues. Again it is stateless and _not_ idempotent.\n\n- There is some transactional process to copy _all_ issues from the JIRA project and create new corresponding issues into the GitLab project.\n\n\n    - If the GitLab project has any existing issues, they are unchanged in this process.\n\n    - If there is any error, everything is rolled back, so that you cannot have partial copies after the process.\n\n    - The process is _not_ idempotent. So if you run the process twice immediately, you will have two copies of the JIRA issues in the GitLab project.\n\n    - There is no state maintained. After you have done the import, both JIRA and GitLab are not aware that it was done. Certainly there is no linkage or synching between issues in the two systems.\n- For each JIRA issue in the JIRA project, create a corresponding issue in the GitLab project, with these mappings:\n\n\n    - JIRA issue summary -\u003e GitLab issue title\n\n    - JIRA issue description -\u003e GitLab issue description\n\n\n        - Simplified text handling/conversion\n    - GitLab issue author := GitLab user who activates this import process.\n- All other fields and attributes in the GitLab issue are set to as if it was created in the GitLab web UI with nothing beyond the above selected. E.g. the issue is in open state and there are no labels associated.","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-03-17T19:37:32.453Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:54:14.540Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T13:36:53.986Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","UX","devops::plan","issues"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"}],"author":{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1939","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1939","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1939/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1939/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1939","relative":"#1939","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#1939"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":4737870,"iid":1921,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: improve process to designate a secondary node as primary(2-node setups)","description":"Right now, designating a secondary node as the primary node requires to enter a bunch of ruby command in the CLI ([documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-geo/disaster-recovery.html#promoting-a-secondary-node)).

for Administrators to create personal access tokens for other users through the API","description":"### Description\n\nAs per my understanding, the only way to create Personal Access Tokens currently is through the web UI. I guess this makes sense for most use-cases as the token itself is often used to authenticate against the API. However, I would like to have the ability to add access tokens for a particular user through the API (when authenticated as an administrator).\n\nMy use-case is that I use Gitlab mostly as a \"backend service\" through the API from my applications and users don't interact with Gitlab directly through the UI. I need to generate access tokens for users so they e.g. can pull private docker images from the internal container registry. The end user doesn't even know they have a Gitlab account so requiring them to log in in order to add the token is impossible. I am looking for a fully automated process. When new users are created through the API, I also need to add the access token to it so other systems can pull from their container registry using the token. Storing the user's password for this purpose is something I'd like to avoid.\n\nI really like how Gitlab is generally good at keeping the API in parity with the UI functionality, but this is one area I think is missing. I don't *think* it would be too much effort to get this implemented?\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd new endpoints to the API to allow an administrator to create personal access tokens for a particular user.\n\n### Links / references\n~\"feature proposal\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-09T18:05:12.105Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T13:10:31.546Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T12:35:51.391Z","closed_by":{"id":2632430,"username":"sliaquat","name":"Sanad Liaquat","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2632430/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sliaquat"},"labels":["api","authentication","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","internal customer","personal access tokens","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},{"id":2632430,"username":"sliaquat","name":"Sanad Liaquat","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2632430/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sliaquat"}],"author":{"id":1102246,"username":"sindrepm","name":"Sindre Paulsrud Moe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/92722149f42bc2797b236a1a3b26e11f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sindrepm"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"user_notes_count":101,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":48,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17176","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/17176","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/17176/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/17176/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#17176","relative":"#17176","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#17176"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":257,"epic":{"id":501,"iid":257,"title":"Improved API for managing PATs and OAuth","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/257","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24651140,"iid":17163,"project_id":278964,"title":"Simplify our usage of the Status icon svg's","description":"### Problem\n\nThere is inconsistency across ci status icons SVG usage.

Many use cases the environment variable is not static but dynamic, for example when using AWS , a user will probably want to use the environment name based on the stage `stage: qa-lambda-47378475` and it can be replaced. In order to run Review apps in such an environment , we would need to support dynamic URLs.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe introduce a new report type of artifact - [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).\n\n```yml\nreview:\n  script:\n    - DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_URL=$(deploy-script)       # In script, you get an environment URL.\n    - echo \"DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_URL=$DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_URL\" \u003e\u003e deploy.env    # Add the value to a dotenv file.\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: deploy.env                        # Report back dotenv file to rails.\n  environment:\n    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG\n    url: $DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_URL                    # and set the variable produced in script to `environment:url`\n    on_stop: stop_review\n\nstop_review:\n  script:\n    - ./teardown-environment\n  when: manual\n  environment:\n    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG            # NOTE: Don't set `environment:url` as `dotenv` file is not generated in this job.\n    action: stop\n```\n\nThis opens an awesome possibility for later passing variables between different builds, by using `dotenv` syntax. The `.env` is a simple `KEY=VALUE` text file with env per line.\n\n### Use cases\n\nAWS Lambda and the Serverless framework which give a dynamic URL based on the stage:\n\n```\nServerless: Stack update finished...\nService Information\nservice: lambda-api\nstage: qa-lambda-47378475\nregion: us-east-1\nstack: lambda-api-qa-lambda-47378475\napi keys:\n  None\nendpoints:\n  POST - https://sg01n2q8ph.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qa-lambda-47378475/gql\nfunctions:\n  graphqlServer: lambda-api-qa-lambda-47378475-graphqlServer\nlayers:\n  None\n```\n\nWe have the same requirement to set `CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL` dynamically (based on data available in the job), but want to allow it to be overridden from `.gitlab-ci.yml` when it is manually set there.\n\n## Technical Proposal\n\n- Runner returns `artifacts:report:dotenv: #{dot_env_file_path}` as a raw artifact.\n- In `Ci::BuildFinalizeWorker/Service`, Rails parses `dotenv` file and persists it into `ci_job_variables` table.\n- In `ci_builds.status == finalizing`, we processes the build.\n\n## TODO\n\n- [ ] Persist DotEnv Variables From an artifact =\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26247\n- [ ] Publish Feature (documentation and feature flag removal)\n\n## Old Proposal for safe keeping:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOld Proposal for safe keeping:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nIf you did support a script-created variable for URLs, I could do something like this :heart::\n\n![image](/uploads/de4f85ad08bb1746c457e70874d3e74c/image.png)\n\n\n**Current Implementation**\n```\ncreate_env:\n  stage: review\n  when: manual\n  script: echo \"Create platform environment and create a dynamic variable called FANCY_SLUG\"\n  environment:\n    name: env/$CI_BUILD_REF_SLUG\n    url: https://$CI_BUILD_REF_SLUG-$FANCY_SLUG-$APPS_DOMAIN\n    on_stop: delete_env\n```\n* `$APPS_DOMAIN` is a YAML-defined variable (not job-level)\n* `$FANCY_SLUG` is a variable that, ideally, could be set during the `script:` portion of the job\n\n**Limitation**\n*  Environment urls in `.gitlab-ci.yml` definitions only expand CI-* variables\n\n**Example**\n![image](/uploads/5dcfa5aec6ef0b08f6ec1f497906a983/image.png)\n\nUsing a popular hosting platform (https://platform.sh/) I can create environments pretty easily by installing their CLI and using authentication tokens. But the entire integration requires that I have some dynamic variable ability in setting the environment URL. Their URL has a token that is unique per branch, something that requires the script step of the review stage.\n\n### Functional Work Around\nLet me upfront tell you that I'm probably the worst dev ops to tell you how or what you should do.

ElasticSearch to be enabled for a subset of projects / groups","description":"ElasticSearch is currently disabled on GitLab.com because we're having trouble getting the indexing to scale to that level, although many happy customers are using it on-premises.\n\nA proposal that came up in discussion with @pcarranza was to allow ElasticSearch to be progressively enabled - we'd have a list of projects and groups, or perhaps a regular expression to select a subset, and only matching projects would be indexed/searched using ElasticSearch. The remainder would be searched in the current way.\n\nAdvantages: \n\n* This would allow us to gather data on how our code is performing in production at the moment\n  * Start with just a few projects enabled\n  * Add instrumentation until we understand what's happening\n  * Add projects and groups until we run into performance problems\n  * FIX THE PROBLEMS\n  * Watch performance improve\n  * Enable more projects\n* Shorter cycle times!\n  * We can get feedback at the threshold of performance problems, rather than it being an all-or-nothing proposition\n  * Won't have to disable ES completely while solving problems\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* It's not a very useful feature in its own right, although being able to exclude certain projects from code search is a potentially valid use case\n* We'd need to conduct two searches (in parallel, to minimize performance degradation) - database and ES -  then merge the results\n\nI was quite enthusiastic about this idea when I first had it, but I'm having second thoughts now. Should I do it for 8.17?

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/lib/gitlab/o_auth/user.rb#L98 we currently try two methods to link LDAP users - find by UID and find by DN, both utilizing `auth_hash.uid`. In the case of Kerberos, `auth_hash.uid` will be something like `john@ORG.DOMAIN.COM`. It's important to note that often the Kerberos realm is NOT the same as the email domain so we cannot look up by email, either. Additionally, LDAP often does not have an attribute that directly corresponds to the full Kerberos principal. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/lib/ee/gitlab/ldap/person.rb#L15 we derive an LDAP user's Kerberos principal using the username + DN. \n\nExample Auth Hash:\n\n```\n\u003cGitlab::OAuth::AuthHash:0x007f4d2cdec0a8 @auth_hash=#\u003cOmniAuth::AuthHash credentials=#\u003cOmniAuth::AuthHash\u003e extra=#\u003cOmniAuth::AuthHash\u003e info=#\u003cOmniAuth::AuthHash::InfoHash email=\"john@kerberos.gitlap.com\" username=\"john\"\u003e provider=\"kerberos\" uid=\"john@KERBEROS.GITLAP.COM\"\u003e, @provider=\"kerberos\", @uid=\"john@KERBEROS.GITLAP.COM\"\u003e\n```\n\nI suggest we put another try before https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/lib/gitlab/o_auth/user.rb#L107 that says something like:\n\n```ruby\nif auth_hash.provider == 'kerberos'\n  person = Gitlab::LDAP::Person.find_by_uid(auth_hash.info['username'], adapter)\n  @ldap_person ||= person if person.kerberos_principal.downcase == auth_hash.uid.downcase\nend\n```\n\nThe `@ldap_person` line's conditional may not be necessary, but I wondered if we needed some additional comparison to 'prove' this is the right user to link, rather than just going on username. Is username enough?\n\ncc/

should not be interpreted as shortcuts (like `@` and `#`)","description":"### Description\n\ngitlab-flavoured markdown keeps adding new shortcuts to create terse, and easy to parse (for humans) textual representation with lots of cross-references. cool.\n\nunfortunately this also means, that an ever growing number of special characters cannot be used for \"normal\" text anymore.\nthis is especially true, for special characters that have a *real-world usage* that looks similar to the text-representation in GFM.\n\nit also doesn't really help, that sometimes a reference will expand to a link (if the referenced item exists), and sometimes it stays \"as is\".\n\nat the time of writing *six* (6!) characters (`@#!$~%`) are overloaded with special meaning (related to gitlab references), making them unusable for other things.\n\n###### examples:\n\n  - `#1` using a hash `#` followed by a number is often used to reference enumerations (in gitlab context this could mean enumerations within a given issue, rather than neighboring *issues*)\n\n  - `~5` the tilde `~` is a common abbreviation for `approximately`\n\n- `$10` prefixing a number with currency symbol is often used to denote amounts of money.\n\n### Proposal\n\nit would be nice, if cross-references could be escaped easily.\n\ne.g. i currently don't have a way to use \"gitlab-ce#1\" without making it either a link to `issue#1` (and creating a back-reference there) or marking it as `code` (which has a distinct look and meaning).\n\neven better than adding special characters to avoid creating gitlab references, would be have been a generic meta-escape character that starts a gitlab cross-reference. e.g. using `#!5` (rather than `!5`) to reference MRs.\n\ni don't see any obvious collision (currently `#[^0-9]` seems to be forbidden anyhow), but feel free to come up with something better.\n\n### Compatibility\nobviously there might be compatibility issues with *removing* special meaning from a given character.\nbut then, i guess you could keep the old behaviour for a while, documenting only the new behaviour (so it gets adopted), and allow the admin to convert all gitlab-references to the *new scheme*\n### References\ngithub at least shares the PR and issue namespace, so you can use `#` to refer to either of them.","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-01-03T08:38:03.248Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T10:42:55.805Z","closed_at":"2021-03-30T15:31:48.216Z","closed_by":{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett

Retrieving a link to source or an asset should be possible using a predictable URL. Something like `/releases/11.4/source.tar.gz`, `releases/11.4/installer.dmg`, and so on. In the interest of making this easy to use, we should also support a way to point to latest:\n\nIn this example, `/releases/latest/installer.dmg` could substitute latest with 11.4. We may need some kind of syntax to differentiate the latest tag from a release that's unfortunately named \"latest.\"\n\n### Proposal\n\nBecause internally these are all links, it should be possible to handle all of this through redirects i.e.:\n\nIf the URL for `installer.dmg` is `http://download.com/myrelease/11.4/installer.dmg`, visiting `/releases/11.4/installer.dmg` should result in a redirect to the internal or external site (we should show a heads up message if we are redirecting to an external site). \n\nSimilarly, visiting latest, if latest is 11.4, we can follow the redirects to get to the right asset eventually, so: `/releases/latest/installer.dmg`\n\n### Use-case\n\nSuppose I use GitLab.com to host my software project and uses GItLab CI to build the software.

API URL or API Port to JIRA Integration","description":"### Description\n\nWe recently upgraded to 8.14.5-ee from 8.13.x-ee and in doing so lost some of the JIRA integration functionality that we previously utilized.\n\n*JIRA Options pre-upgrade*:\n- Description\n- Project URL: https://jira.host/issues/?jql=project=\u003cYOUR-JIRA-PROJECT-HERE\u003e\n- Issues URL: https://jira.host/browse/:id\n- New Issue URL: https://jira.host/secure/CreateIssue.jspa\n- API URL: https://jira.host:8446/rest/api/2\n- Username\n- Password\n- JIRA Issue Transition\n\n*JIRA Options post-upgrade*:\n- URL: https://jira.host:8446\n- Project key: PROJECT\n- Username\n- Change Password\n- Jira issue transition\n\nThe use case is that our API calls utilize a non-standard port due to our JIRA instance living in a VM environment that where :non-standard-port is PAT'd to 443. We were able to obtain the intended functionality by setting the API URL to `jira.host:port` while the other URLs were set to `jira.host` and were able to resolve properly due to host-headers being in place.\n\nYou'll see in the Screenshot below that the URL shows `jira.host:8446`. This does not resolve in-browser and is generated due to the URL in the integration being set to jira.host:8446. Currently we're choosing to maintain API functionality (so commits and MRs are added in JIRA), instead of having URLs rendering properly in Gitlab.\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![Screen_Shot_2016-12-21_at_2.27.27_PM](/uploads/4e88b85af10072607f7fa3db9d0bf634/Screen_Shot_2016-12-21_at_2.27.27_PM.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd API URL or an API Port field to the JIRA integration for non-standard port usage.","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-12-21T19:21:48.165Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:57:28.260Z","closed_at":"2017-04-26T11:52:57.071Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Integration::Jira","devops::plan","priority::2","severity::2"],"milestone":{"id":269773,"iid":23,"project_id":278964,"title":"9.2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-20T13:55:42.958Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T11:02:55.198Z","due_date":"2017-05-21","start_date":"2017-04-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/23"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":709287,"username":"rwcee","name":"Rob Campbell","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/709287/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rwcee"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":30,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1442","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1442","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1442/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1442/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1442","relative":"#1442","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#1442"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24649910,"iid":16766,"project_id":278964,"title":"Change layout of system notes when changing title of the issue","description":"\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOriginal description/proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Description\n\nWhen we change the title of the issue, we create a system note for that.

If it is defined, and you want 0 to be a success, it must be included in your array.\n- If `warning:` is not defined, it is evaluated as `warning: []`\n- If `canceled:` is not defined, it is evaluated as `canceled: []`\n- If a job is set to `allow_failure: true`, all failure states will be also treated as warnings.\n\n#### Invalid configurations:\n\nThe following configuration should be considered invalid and a syntax error should be returned because of duplicate values (`1` in this case). Both `success` and `warning` should have mutually exclusive values.\n\n```yaml\nmy-job:\n  script:\n    - echo Hello world!\n  script_exit_codes:\n    success: [0, 1, 2]\n    warning: [1]\n```\n\n### References\n\nIt would be used by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/8121\n\nIdea from @ayufan during Slack conversation :)\n\n## Sequencing\n\n1. Add `script_exit_codes` to the YAML keywords\n1. Include `script_exit_codes` in the `/request` jobs [response](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75953cffaa8775f69fd5c068c2ce717d0e9339de/app/services/ci/register_job_service.rb#L98-104)\n1.

This should already be done as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/4843\n1.

There is no inline link to our monthly release post that matches the version of the GitLab instance.\n\n##### Thoughts\n- Promote our release post or something similar cc: @tauriedavis \n- Make sure people actually update the instance whenever a new release is out\n- Better place to show version info than on the help page\n- Notify of new version\n\n### Proposal\n\n* For the first iteration, we add a \"What's new?\" item to the Help dropdown as depicted in the design below.\n* Tell instances about new things that have been added in their current version by adding static release notes that live locally on the instance.\n    * For a first iteration, we can just generate these from `CHANGELOG.md`.\n\n* Tell instances about new things that have been added in future versions:\n    * I think that the boring/most straightforward approach here is to just always link to the latest major release post. For a first iteration, we can link to the latest major release by linking to a static URL on `about.gitlab.com` that redirects to the most recent release post. \n\nFuture iterations:\n* In the future, we can make this approach fancier and more friendly to read. Maybe by writing specific release notes from the release post.\n* Create an endpoint on `about.gitlab.com` which receives a url param of the instance version. This would let us create a cool diff between your instance version and latest.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/uploads/3e85d2398f270965e6e16f5a5d75ac36/variations.png\" width=345px\u003e\n\n### Previous Proposal\n\n* For the first iteration, we add a \"What's new?\" item to the Help dropdown as depicted in the design below.\n* This new item will be placed between `Help` and `Contribute to GitLab`.\n* The \"What's new?\" row should link to the release post for the installed version.\n  * For patch releases, the row will link to the blog post for the **corresponding** major or minor release (e.g. an `11.6.3` installation links to `11.6`)\n  * For release candidates, the row will link to the blog post for the **previous** major or minor release (e.g. a `11.6-RC3` installation links to `11.5`)\n\n### Links / references\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/24479\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/23598\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/2359814381 ","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-12-05T23:14:58.436Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T20:02:21.346Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T20:02:21.288Z","closed_by":{"id":4089849,"username":"jackib","name":"Jacki Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/45cb9a7b286a89f770f76d90b6cf33fd?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jackib"},"labels":["UX","depth","group::not_owned","missed-deliverable","missed:11.6","missed:11.8","navigation","priority::2","release post item","researched [DEPRECATED]","type::feature","user onboarding","workflow::blocked","🍉"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

(Boards are new so that's understandable)\n\n### Proposal\nA User should be able to fully create and edit an issue from the board (including use of keyboard shortcuts)\n\n--------\nCurrently we can create an issue title only from each of the board lists - with the board list tag automatically assigned to it. \nTo create an issue from the board with a description, user needs to:\n\nAdd issue from board list,\nclick on issue title -\u003e load  issue page,\nclick on edit -\u003e load edit issue page.\nFill in description,-\u003e Save changes\nClick on issues in menu bar\nClick on board to return to board page\n\n---------------------------------------------\n-Allow edit of issue title and description on issue detail page. \nA quick win to prevent progressing to 2 different pages, would be to add an edit button for issue title and one for description in the issue detail page as the edit issue page is almost redundant - nearly everything else can be edited from edit detail page. Or clicking on existing edit button allows edit of title and description on same page. \n\n- Add ability to add description from issue side menu.  \nThis will mean issue descriptions can be added directly from board page.\n\n- Add use of existing issue keyboard shortcuts on board page.  \nShortcuts already exist for assignee etc... (allow these to be used on board page).

So that way, we don't have to mess with any weird project set up design / tech things in this issue. The assumption is that the integration is already there and we are building on our existing base.\n- So for a qualified GitLab project, anytime you can go into some menu, click a button (or some UI), and then it just dumps a copy of all the JIRA issues into GitLab issues. Again it is stateless and _not_ idempotent.\n* There is some transactional process to copy _all_ issues from the JIRA project and create new corresponding issues into the GitLab project.\n  * If the GitLab project has any existing issues, they are unchanged in this process.\n  * If there is any error, everything is rolled back, so that you cannot have partial copies after the process.\n  * The process is _not_ idempotent. So if you run the process twice immediately, you will have two copies of the JIRA issues in the GitLab project.\n  * There is no state maintained. After you have done the import, both JIRA and GitLab are not aware that it was done. Certainly there is no linkage or synching between issues in the two systems.\n\n### MVC Target Data\n\n#### Initial MVC\n\n* For each JIRA issue in the JIRA project, create a corresponding issue in the GitLab project, with these mappings:\n  * JIRA issue summary -\u003e GitLab issue title\n  * JIRA issue description -\u003e GitLab issue description\n     * Simplified text handling/conversion\n  * GitLab issue author := GitLab user who activates this import process.\n* All other fields and attributes in the GitLab issue are set to as if it was created in the GitLab web UI with nothing beyond the above selected. E.g. the issue is in open state and there are no labels associated.\n\n#### Follow-up Iterations (a.k.a. what the MVC doesn't do)\n\n- Add comment on behalf of importer with information about the import / meta-data\n- Add support for user mapping\n- Add support for importing comments\n- Add support for importing attachments\n- Add support for importing sub-tasks as issues and setting them as dependents on the parent issue\n- Add support for importing labels\n- Add support for importing weight\n- Add support for importing due date\n- Add support for importing Epics\n- Add support for importing epic and issue dependencies\n- Add support for importing both open and closed issues\n- Add support for more granularly specifying which issues to import via label, status, or JQL query. \n- Add support for mapping custom fields to labels and/or append description with table of `key:value`\n- Generate traceability report to demonstrate input and output and that there was no data loss. \n\n##### Issues\n\n```\n{\n    title: JIRAIssue.fields.summary,\n    description: JIRAIssue.fields.description,\n    labels: [JIRAIssue.fields.issuetype.name],\n    created_at: JIRAIssue.fields.created,\n    updated_at: JIRAIssue.fields.updated,\n    done: issue.fields.status.statusCategory.name === 'Done' ? true : false,\n    assignee: jiraToGitlabUser(JIRAIssue.fields.assignee ),\n    reporter: jiraToGitlabUser(JIRAIssue.fields.reporter),\n    comments: JIRAComments.map(JIRAComment =\u003e ({\n      author: jiraToGitlabUser(JIRAComment.author),\n      comment: JIRAComment.body,\n      created_at: JIRAComment.created\n    })),\n    attachments: JIRAAttachments.map(JIRAAttachment =\u003e ({\n      author: jiraToGitlabUser(JIRAAttachment.author),\n      filename: JIRAAttachment.filename,\n      content: JIRAAttachment.content,\n      created_at: JIRAAttachment.created\n    }))\n};\n```\n\n##### Epics (Next Gen Only)\n\n```\nTBD\n```\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/gitlab-rivals-winter-is-here-584eacf1fe9a)\n\n### Original proposal\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nAs a user, I want to import existing issues from JIRA to GitLab so that I can switch from JIRA to GitLab as my ticketing system.

Instead, they should only take effect when clicking `Save`. This gives the user a chance to exit without saving.\n- If possible, the order should be different from the issuable sidebar, so the options that are most relevant to scoping are at the top: `Milestone`, `Labels`, `Assignee`, `Author`, `Weight`\n- The `Save changes` button should be disabled until the user makes a change. If they undo their changes manually, we don't have to disable the button.\n- When you click `View scope`, the modal pops up. When you dismiss the modal, the temporary filter area does not change. Any filters applied do not change.\n- When you click `Edit board`, the modal pops up. If you click cancel (maybe you made some changes, doesn't matter), the board config did not change. The modal is dismissed, and the temporary filter area does not change at all.\n- When you click `Edit board`, the modal pops up. If you click `Save changes` (and even if you actually didn't make any changes), the board \"refreshes\" as it applies the new configuration. And the temporary filter area is reset and is now blank.\n\n| Empty state | Editing value | Values |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--empty-state](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/cd778f6f5fda4b82db3e278fd55b3c24/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--empty-state.png) | ![ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--editing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/0bd28a4fb981a8936946386f67396449/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--editing.png) | ![ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--full](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/5ba34f0baa0482317eae85acf066bd61/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--full.png) |\n\n\n#### Users without permissions\n- If you don't have permissions, you can just view the board scope\n- The title of the modal changes to `Board scope`\n- The `Board name` section is not displayed, as it doesn't make sense to show a disabled text field\n- The `Edit` buttons for each section are not displayed in the modal\n- The footer with the `Save` and `Cancel` buttons is not displayed\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/6a10f397e66cdcab39c069d37af36a60/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--no-permissions.png\" height=150px\u003e\n\n\n#### Behavior\n- For this iteration, you can only set _one_ assignee for the board config. (This is because the assignee search for the board filter and issues list view search bar currently has some bugs. So we want to simplify for this first iteration.)\n- If the saved configuration has a milestone, then the temporary filter area cannot filter by milestone.\n- If the saved configuration has an author, then the temporary filter area cannot filter by author.\n- If the saved configuration has an assignee, then the temporary filter area cannot filter by assignee.\n- If the saved configuration has weight, then the temporary filter area cannot filter by weight.\n- If the saved configuration has a label, then the temporary filter area can still have labels. You can even filter by the same label as a saved configuration label (as a simplifying assumption).\n\n#### Milestones and labels\n- If it is a project board, you can view/configure all project milestones and group milestones.\n- If it is a project board, you can view/configure all project labels and group labels.\n- If it is a group board, you can view/configure _only_ group milestones.\n- If it is a group board, you can view/configure _only_ group labels.\n\n\n### Creating a board\n- The current flow will no longer be used. The current board creation dropdown should be removed.\n- When the user clicks the `Create new board` row in the board switcher, they are shown a similar modal to the one used for editing\n- The title of the modal is `Create new board`\n- The board name text box is automatically focused\n- The `Create board` button is inactive at first. It becomes active once the user enters a name for the board\n- The Create board modal has a collapsed state so as not to overwhelm the user with too many options at once\n- When the user clicks the `Expand` button, the modal becomes taller and all the scope options are displayed. The `Expand` button turns into `Collapse`\n- When you click `Create new board`, the modal pops up. The existing board in the background remains. So if you click cancel in the modal, you return to the existing board, and nothing changes. The temporary filter area does not change. If you click `Create board` to complete the form/modal, the new board appears and the temporary filter is now blank.\n- If you hit `Cancel` when creating a board and open the modal again, all fields will be blank.\n\n| Create board | Name entered | Expanded |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--create-empty](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/7b192a214d49698815a4177a261b8b3f/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--create-empty.png) | ![ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--create-name](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e912b9100ae3f1e5276ec8ced6bccc7b/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--create-name.png) | ![ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--create-expanded](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/cbbf4074c9d7c2fa7bcf2bd5aacafe26/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--create-expanded.png) |\n\n\n#### UI considerations\n- The modal can be dismissed by clicking the `x` in the top right, or the `Cancel` button.\n- The total width of the modal is `440px`.\n- The modal is centered vertically in the content area behind it (always below the top bar).\n- Minimum margins: `16px` to global top bar, `16px` to the bottom of the window.\n- The height of the modal should be calculated when opening so it can fit the necessary rows without whitespace.\n- The content of the modal should be scrollable if there is not enough vertical space.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/88157369fe8c348a49efcd3f4d69498d/ee_2518__issue-boards-saved-configuration--empty-state.png\" height=150px\u003e\n\n- When the height of the content changes while the modal is open, it can either resize dynamically or become scrollable. It's up to whatever @psimyn finds is a simpler implementation.\n\n#### Other UI tweaks\n- Remove the `Go to a board` header section in the dropdown. It's unnecessary.

If there's more boards beyond the displayed rows (see mockup), make the last board in the dropdown faded so that the user knows to scroll. This has been scheduled for %\"10.2\" with #3181. \n- The fade effect would be a good addition to the modal itself and the dropdowns you can open inside the modal.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/d42d9dfa4e469be8bb1f70fcd1a2412c/board-dropdown-list.png\" height=\"200px\" /\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-10-27T20:12:06.894Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:59:59.590Z","closed_at":"2017-11-07T09:55:54.657Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Category:Team Planning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","backend","boards","devops::plan","direction","frontend","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":349702,"iid":2,"group_id":9970,"title":"10.2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-24T13:53:41.702Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T16:15:32.616Z","due_date":"2017-11-22","start_date":"2017-10-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/2"},"assignees":[{"id":563185,"username":"cperessini","name":"Chris Peressini","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/563185/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cperessini"},{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"}],"author":{"id":5497,"username":"JobV","name":"Job van der Voort","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e1e9ffdda52d8c519ac5c49929d7dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JobV"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":563185,"username":"cperessini","name":"Chris Peressini","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/563185/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cperessini"},"user_notes_count":86,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2518","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":9,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2518","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2518/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2518/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2518","relative":"#2518","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#2518"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24647931,"iid":16267,"project_id":278964,"title":"Keep latest artifacts for the last successful jobs","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\nThe `expire_in` function is great, but depending on how often your pipeline is built can be hard to tune. If you don't build frequently, setting a short `expire_in` can result in your most recent artifact being deleted. Setting it too long can keep unneeded copies around. Over time this can use up a lot of disk space. Most of the time, people just want to ensure they always at least have the most recent artifact, whenever that was built.\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement a default behavior for all projects to always keep the latest artifact for each successful job that was part of a successful pipeline (that produced artifacts) on any active (non-deleted) branch, merge request, or tag (i.e., the one downloaded via https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.html#downloading-the-latest-artifacts is exempt from any `expire_in` policy). In other words, **never delete** the most recent artifact (even if expired), which is same artifact as described at the docs link here:\n\n![image](/uploads/c29013d1f233f16e300915dd76902108/image.png)\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- Artifacts for deleted branches follow `expire_in`\n- All non-latest artifacts follow `expire_in`\n- Only the latest artifact for a job on a non-deleted branch is kept\n\nThis would allow for setting a relatively aggressive expiration policy, while remaining confident you always have your most recent artifact for any active branches.\n\n#### Implementation notes\n\nBecause `expire_in:` could be set too short we would need to define a way to \"lock\" the latest artifacts to prevent deletion by `ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker`. For example add a new column `job_artifacts.locked` (false by default). Then when a pipeline completes we will lock the latest artifacts in a moving window: lock last ones and unlock anything from previous pipelines. Finally the `ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker` would need to be modified to filter out locked artifacts.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is to unlock artifacts when a branch is deleted or they would remain locked and never deleted.\n\n#### Out of Scope for this MVC \n\nItems not expected for this MVC issue:\n*  ability to keep latest **N** count of artifacts per job\n*  new checkbox in project's `Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e General pipelines` for `Keep latest job artifacts per ref`\n*  allow artifacts to live longer than **N** days for compliance reasons\n*  aggressively remove artifacts which are not the latest even before they expire","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-10-25T11:11:54.715Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T20:23:38.059Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T13:57:20.693Z","closed_by":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"labels":["CI artifacts","Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","Kickoff Highlight","UX","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::verify","direction","documentation","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","popular proposal","potential proposal","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"}],"author":{"id":214882,"username":"markus-k","name":"Markus Kasten","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/21e11259e42949ddfe515203d023781e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markus-k"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"user_notes_count":213,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":363,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16267","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/16267","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/16267/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/16267/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#16267","relative":"#16267","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#16267"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4923,"epic":{"id":144320,"iid":4923,"title":"Keep latest artifact feature epic","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4923","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":3284875,"iid":1144,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow admins to restrict push mirroring by project","description":"### Description\n\nAs currently implemented anyone can set up a mirrored repository.

Different scenarios as shown below. To be separated into multiple issues.\n\n### Resources\nPM @victorwu | UX @dimitrieh \n\n### Background\n- Currently, approvals are used to block a merge request from being merged.\n- However, when a merge request is already merged, there are no strict requirements. However, in GitLab currently, you cannot continue approvals after a merge request has been merged.\n- This makes the product unnecessarily complicated. We want to make GitLab as simple as possible. One way is to reduce the number of rules. The proposal here is to allow approving/unapproving even when a merge request is merged. The benefit is that we reduce the complexity in the product, reduce number of business rules.\n- Another benefit is that reviewers can express their signals on a merge request, even after it has been merged. Reviewers can come back and continue to approve / unapprove. The UI design should make it super obvious that the signal doesn't impact the merge request (it is already merged). And so there should be very little confusion about it. But this allows reviewers to continue expressing their signal. For example, if there are 10 approvers, but 3 already approved (and 3 was the required number). The remaining 7 can come back after the fact and continue talking and express their signals in the merge request. We should not restrict them. It solves the problem of unnecessarily restricting users/reviewers in discussing a code change, even after it has been merged.\n\n### Docs blurb\nYou can now approve merge requests (or remove your approval), even though the required number has already been reached.\n\n### Description\n* If the number of approvals is not met, it should block the merge request from being merge-able.\n* Achieving the required approvals is a necessary condition for the merge request to be merge-able, but not sufficient.\n* If somebody unapproves and falls below the threshold, the merge request is blocked again.\n* Under all merge request states (open/closed/merged and reached/not reached enough approvals), a qualified user should be able to approve or unapprove the merge request.\n* Even if you have reached the required number of approvals, you can continue to approve and unapprove.\n* Under all merge request states (open/closed/merged and reached/not reached enough approvals), view the status of the approvals.\n* View who are explicit qualified approvers, including the users / groups that have been selected in either the project settings or the overwritten merge request settings.\n* View who has approved. View who has not approved. View how many need to be approved / how many left to be approved.\n* Iterate on the existing UX design. There is feedback that the existing empty dotted circle is confusing.\n\n### Design\n\n### Design\n\nScreenshot are from the perspective of:

Click 'New Page' on a wiki you have create rights for,\n2. In the following modal, fill in ` \u0026 \u003c \u003e \\ \\  { } \u0026 ` as the page's slug/title\n3.

It also (quite possibly incorrectly) assumes that `/` is a piece of a URL path, and not part of the name. `I/MY/ME` currently results in a page called `ME` under path `I/MY`, which may not be desired behaviour.  \n\n(note: only `\u0026\u003c\u003e\\` were tested (and tested positive on weird results), there may be other strangely behaving characters)\n\nUPDATE 1\u00262: better issue description and more tests experience included","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-10-07T18:52:27.644Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T15:39:26.614Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T16:34:49.738Z","closed_by":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","Deliverable","backend","default-priority","default-severity","devops::create","group::editor","missed:12.9","priority::4","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"}],"author":{"id":449611,"username":"MMeent","name":"MMeent","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f66617dff9923e1d775137a4b607daf6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MMeent"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16131","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/16131","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/16131/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/16131/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#16131","relative":"#16131","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#16131"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24647339,"iid":16098,"project_id":278964,"title":"Change Sidekiq testing mode to `fake` instead of `inline`","description":"Per https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testing, `Sidekiq::Testing.fake!` is default mode so we shouldn't call it explicitely.\n\nTests like the ones from `Projects::DestroyService`:\n\n```ruby\ncontext 'Sidekiq inline' do\n  before do\n    # Run sidekiq immediatly to check that renamed repository will be removed\n    Sidekiq::Testing.inline!

The ability to choose to start sub-pipelines (or not) is a powerful ability, especially when the YAML can be dynamically generated on the fly.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n[Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nIf a parent (originating) pipeline was able to trigger a set of concurrently running child pipelines, you could solve each of these problems:\n\n- Child pipelines would execute each of their jobs still according to a stage sequence but would be free to continue forward through their stages without waiting for unrelated jobs to finish.\n- The configuration would be distributed out into each of the child pipeline configurations, reducing cognitive load to understand everything.\n- Imports would be done at the child pipeline level, reducing the likelihood of collisions\n- Each pipeline would have only the steps relevant, making it easier to understand what's going on.\n\nYou also get some nice benefits for doing things this way:\n\n- By using existing triggering functionality, you can take advantage of `only: changes` type keywords to trigger pipelines only when certain files change (this is valuable for monorepos, for example).\n- By keeping the base (parent) `.gitlab-ci.yml` as a normal pipeline, it can have its own behaviors and sequencing in relation to triggers.\n- Also by keeping it a normal pipeline, if someone doesn't use this feature, it just works exactly as you'd expect. No special configuration.\n- By taking advantage of status attribution (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11238), the pipeline can wait for success of the child without any other special code/configuration required, wait for it to complete but not care about the result, or can just trigger it and not follow it at all.\n\nAll of this will work with includes, so you can retain composability within the configuration.\n\nThis first issue will allow for one level of child pipelines (i.e., one parent, n pipelines) and child pipelines will not be able to trigger further downstream pipelines. We will address this in a fast-follow issue (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/29651) where we will allow for some additional levels, with some limit to prevent infinite recursion.\n\n### Implementation\n\nIntroduce a new syntax for triggering a child pipeline by using the `include` syntax:\n\n```yaml\nmicroservice_a:\n  trigger:\n    include: local: config/microservice_a.yml\n    strategy: depend\n  only:\n    changes:\n      - microservice_a/*\n```\n\nFor this example, a triggering job called `microservice_a` in the parent pipeline would be triggered that would use the yaml from the repository in `config/microservice_a.yml` as its configuration. It would only run if there are changes in the `microservice_a` folder, and it will [treat it as a dependency](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11238) (i.e., fail if the child pipeline fails.. alternatively, the `wait` strategy would wait for it to finish, but not care if it passes or fails.)\n\nThis approach would follow the same syntax as the `include` keyword (so supports `local`, `file`, `template`, and `remote`.) This would also support multiple includes, which would be merged following existing `include` rules:\n\n```yaml\nmicroservice_a:\n  trigger:\n    include: \n      - local: config/microservice_a.yml\n      - local: config/all_microservices.yml\n    strategy: depend\n  only:\n    changes:\n      - microservice_a/*\n```\n\nA pipeline triggered in this way would start running independently but would have status attribution to a parent pipeline (via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11238). If you look at the parent pipeline's pipeline page, you must see that the pipeline is running or completed, and if you click on it, it must take you to the child pipeline's pipeline page.\n\nBy implementing things in this way, we do not need to radically change the user experience within GitLab and it works largely in the way you'd expect. There is always a parent pipeline since child pipelines can only be triggered from a parent.\n\n### UI implications\n\n- Child pipelines will only be accessible through their parent pipelines to start off with. This reduces scope and complexity, the following follow up issue is created to look into expanding it if need be: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37051\n  - Child pipelines will thus not be featured in pipeline lists\n  - Child pipelines are not considered for the merge request widget or commit status\n  - The pipeline graph, mini-pipeline graph dropdown, and job lists will thus allow the user to navigate to the child pipeline.\n- Child pipelines will __not__ get tags such as `Latest`\n\n#### Pipeline detail view\n\n##### Info widget\n\n- Child pipelines do get a child pipeline tag on the pipeline detail view which is clickable and navigates to the parent pipeline page. `Child pipeline (parent)` similar to a [moved issue status badge](/uploads/f51b128a1ff885e58f6c90dcdd11e3ff/image.png).\n  - Tooltip states: `This is a child pipeline within the parent pipeline`\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/c41db44fc20ebe711daeb2b2b35c644d/image.png)\n\n##### Pipeline graph view\n\n* Lines connecting the current pipeline nodes with the representations of the child/downstream pipelines are hidden/deleted.\n* Individual nodes for child pipelines or parent pipelines will get a tag indicating `child`/`parent` to differentiate from multi-project pipelines.\n\n![New_Wireframe_1_copy_2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/ae83cad2f8ffbd5db0a3bb4847f82875/New_Wireframe_1_copy_2.png)\n\n#### Job list\n\n- ~~In job lists, the trigger job will get a tag `[icon] child pipeline` with the icon `trigger-source`. This tag is an anchor towards the child pipeline.~~ =\u003e This has been considered out of scope for now\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/6d18b0cb8816c3bb9fec47932e2a321b/image.png)\n\n#### Mini pipeline graph\n\n* No changes needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Tasks\n\n1. [x] `[p1]` CI yaml syntax to define child pipelines creation - We could use a `Feature.enabled?(:ci_child_pipelines)` that is `off` by default - this will enable us to work on the rest of the dependencies ~backend \n1. [x] `[p1]` Change [`Ci::CreateCrossProjectPipelineService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/6503f801151ea280ce2420503e4206c00f42f46b/ee/app/services/ci/create_cross_project_pipeline_service.rb)/`Worker` to being able to create pipelines for the same project - ensure child pipeline must inherit all settings of parent pipeline when running `trigger: local:`\n1. [ ] `[p1]` Rename `Ci::CreateCrossProjectPipelineService` to `Ci::CreateDownstreamPipelineService`/`Worker` ~backend \n1. [x] `[p1]` Define limitations for a child pipeline not to create further child pipelines and for the `trigger:include` to have a limited number of files to be included ~backend \n1. [ ] `[p1]` ~~Child pipeline trigger job should not return triggered array from endpoint~~ ~backend\n1. [x] `[p1]` Allow frontend to distinguish between a child vs downstream and parent vs upstream pipeline. ~backend \n1. [x] `[p2]` Filter out child pipelines from being displayed in the merge request pipelines tab and pipelines index ~backend \n1. [ ] `[p2]` A trigger job that triggers a child pipeline should show that it is not a normal trigger job. ~frontend ~UX\n1. [ ] `[p2]` A trigger job that triggers a child pipeline should link back to the child pipeline detail view ~frontend \n\nTasks to be handled in separate issues:\n1. [x] `[p2]` Allow variables of trigger job to be passed to the child pipeline allowing to fine-tune it ( https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37348 but as part of this MVC scope) ~backend \n1. [x] `[p2]` Flip defaults for the feature flag to be `default_enabled: true` - This will essentially activate the feature on production. (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37351) ~backend \n\n### Supporting dynamic jobs follow-up\n\nWhat this would leave out for now, though, is supporting dynamically generated .gitlab-ci.ymls. I have created issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35632 as a follow up to support this and scheduled it for immediate follow-up in %12.7. This way this would work would be by improving the `include` keyword to support a new `artifact` keyword from which the dynamically generated CI YAML could be fetched. This would also add the ability for includes in general to support runtime-generated YAML passed through artifacts.\n\n### Real-life Example\n\nGitLab QA and gitlab-qa#6, where we would like to trigger pipeline for GitLab CE or GitLab EE checks depending on project that triggering MR belongs to. This may be also interesting feature for GitLab Omnibus, to build EE / CE images easier. This is no longer the case with GitLab since we merged our projects, but the case is still illustrative.\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nPermissions and user context of the child pipeline will follow the parent pipeline, so there is no new security implication with this feature.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n- [Powerful, integrated primitives

It's about what pipelines cause other pipelines to run.\n\n#### Solution\n\nLogic of prototype from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2122#note_117374817 is still applicable\n- [Prototype link](https://framer.cloud/gAgce/index.html)\n- [Prototype gif](/uploads/ee4b88c23eacf3613dfb283db2ee08d5/2018-11-15_23.10.25.gif)\n\nSpecs:\n- [Spec preview](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/dimitrie/ee%232122-crossprojectpipelines-mvc-spec-previews/)\n\n#### Upstream\n\nLoading:\n\n![upstream-loading](/uploads/fe15d202fc6e6987026934b4fda399fb/upstream-loading.png)\n\nExpanded:\n\n![upstream-expanded](/uploads/c09b43fbf29c9d066d038aa88ddd0219/upstream-expanded.png)\n\n#### Downstream\n\nLoading:\n\n![downstream-loading](/uploads/f3794793270291bd6d97d5ae89c08219/downstream-loading.png)\n\nMultiple + one is expanded\n\n![multiple-downstreams](/uploads/1bbe955124538a7cae30d376b0eeae19/multiple-downstreams.png)\n\nSingle + expanded:\n\n![single-downstream](/uploads/8956ef7bddb2045032a6c72ba909f276/single-downstream.png)\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Upstream/downstream pipelines are expandable+collapsable showing their pipeline graph inline\n- Inline upstream/downstream pipeline graphs are positioned along the Y-axis according to the position of their project position in the upstream/downstream lists from which they are expanded from.\n- Only one downstream can be expanded at a time (if you expand another one, the initial one will be collapsed/replaced)\n- Expanded upstream pipelines do not show downstreams of their own which are non related to the current pipeline\n- Upstream/downstream loading states temporarily replace the pipeline status icon with a spinner\n- Scrolling stays unaffected, except for positioning expanded/collapsed content into view.\n\nFE notes:\n1. Fetch the main endpoint `pipelines/{id}.json`\n1. Look for `triggered_by` for the upstream\n1. Look for `triggered` for the downstream pipelines\n1. Look for `triggered_by.path` and `triggers[idx].path` it only misses the `.json`\nFrontend will start polling on click for each upstream/downstream\n\n- it’s not possible to have any upstream/downstream expanded by default bc we won’t have the data. the user has to click on it, we are all ok with this :thumbsup:\n- We will poll the endpoints for both upstream \u0026 downstream pipelines\n- Once the user clicks to collapse, we will stop polling. if the user clicks again we fetch again and show a loading again\n\n### Documentation\n\nThis would good to document at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html#pipeline-graphs, perhaps adding a new section about seeing upstream and downstream pipelines.\n\nDocumentation blurbs\n\n- General topic\n\nLarger projects, especially those adopting a micro-services architecture, often have a set of interdependent components that form the complete product. When working with these projects, it is important to be able to build, test, and deploy both the individual parts as well as the whole. For example when developers are working on a low level service, it is important to ensure downstream components are not negatively impacted by changes.\u003cbr\u003eWith Cross Project Pipelines, GitLab will have first class support for managing and running CI/CD pipelines across projects. Users will be able to easily link a projects CI/CD stages into the full pipeline, as well as view current status.\n\n- Specific documentation blurb\n\nIn a multi-project scenario, it is very important for developers to access some basic details of related projects when viewing upstream and downstream links.

After looking into https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/22374 I realise we now seriously need this. Caching of mentioned users is rather tricky to get right, but I think we should be able to do it using the following approach:\n\nThe mentioned users are stored in a Redis list (*not* a set), without any of the Rails caching mess getting involved. When we want to retrieve the mentioned users we first check if this set exists. If the list exists (regardless of whether it's empty or not) we return the users stored in it, otherwise we parsing the notes and what not and then populate the list. The list in turn consists out of _just_ the IDs of the mentioned users.\n\nWhen a note is added we add any mentioned user IDs to the list. We do *not* check for duplicates, instead we always push the name into the list.\n\nWhen a note is _modified_ we need to do some extra work. First we need to get the IDs that were mentioned before the change (this requires us to know the old value of the note), then we get the new IDs. Any IDs added are added to the Redis list, any IDs that were removed are removed from the list. When removing items from the list we *must only* remove the amount of instances that were removed by the note, not all of them. For example, if your note used to mention `@alice` twice and only 1 mention was removed then we'll only remove *1* instance of `@alice` from the list.\n\nWhen a note is removed the behaviour is the same as above instead we only remove values from the list instead of also adding them.\n\nIn all cases the modifications have to be wrapped in a transaction (http://redis.io/topics/transactions) and the key used should be watched for any modifications. If another process modified the key concurrently the whole transaction should be aborted and the process should be retried. In theory this should ensure we can handle concurrent modifications of the participants list.\n\nIn pseudo Ruby (completely untested):\n\n```ruby\nif note.new?\n  to_add = note.ids_of_mentioned_users\n  to_remove = []\nelse\n  old_ids = old_note.ids_of_mentioned_users\n  new_ids = note.ids_of_mentioned_users\n\n  # If my memory serves me right this sorta should work\n  to_add = new_ids - old_ids\n  to_remove = old_ids - new_ids\nend\n\nloop do\n  replies = redis.watch(the_cache_key) do\n    redis.multi do |transaction|\n      to_remove.each do |id_to_remove|\n        # This ensures that if `to_remove` includes two instances of the same ID\n        # we remove exactly two instances of that ID from the list.\n        transaction.lrem(the_cache_key, to_remove.count(id_to_remove), id_to_remove)\n      end\n\n      # Adding keys should take place _after_ removing ones so we can ensure\n      # newly added mentions are always cached.\n      transaction.linsert(the_cache_key, to_add)\n    end\n  end\n\n  # If a concurrent modification took place then the `watch` method returns\n  # `nil`.\n  break if replies\nend\n```\n\n## OMG why not use a Set?\n\nBecause when using a set we lose track of the number of mentions of a user. This in turn means that when we remove a single instance of a user being mentioned we effectively remove the user from the mentioned users list, even when there are mentions in other notes. By using a regular list we can essentially combine a reference counter and storage container in the same data type. This does require something like `User.where(id: redis_list_with_ids.uniq)` when getting the users (to reduce the query size) but that's a side effect that's not really an issue.\n\nUsing a single key/type also makes it easier to deal with concurrent modifications as we only have to check for modifications of a single key.\n\n## Key Format\n\nThe key format should be `/projects/:project-id/issues/:issue-id/mentioned_users` for issues and `/projects/:project-id/merge_requests/:mr-id/mentioned_users` for merge requests.\n\n## Warning\n\nThis stuff is hard and we really need solid tests for this. Testing concurrency related problems is next to impossible (especially on MRI which doesn't even let you run multiple Ruby threads in parallel), so whoever implements this should take extreme care to make sure that the implementation actually works (using a pen and paper helps, also just taking your time).","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-20T16:12:41.566Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T17:01:56.319Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T06:31:21.242Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","banzai","bug::performance","devops::plan"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

As a user credential, GitLab SSH keys usually fall under these policies. Compliance-minded organizations do not have a way to set a namespace-wide expiration policy for SSH keys, which can create a gap in their audit posture around security controls for user credentials. \n\n### Proposal\n\n- Add an `Maximum allowable lifetime for SSH keys (days)` field to `Admin` \u003e `Settings` \u003e `General` \u003e `Account and limit`.  (Very similar to the [feature for Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#when-personal-access-tokens-expire).)\n- If set, use this value to pre-populate a value for the \"Expires at\" field that appears when a user is [adding an SSH key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#adding-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account).  If the [Enforce SSH key expiration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/250480) option is enabled, then that value should not be modifiable by the user.\n\n### Implementation plan (~backend)\n\n* Add an instance-level option \"SSH expiry can be up to X days from creation\".\n  * Overridden with `null` (no restriction on expiration date) if:\n    * Licence is not Ultimate\n    * SSH key expiration is not enforced.\n* When a user adds a new SSH key, they must set an expiry that is no further than X days in the future otherwise validation fails.\n\n### Further details\n\nPreviously, we implemented https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36243 which adds a user-facing, optional SSH key expiration field to `Avatar` \u003e `Settings` \u003e `SSH Keys` \u003e `Expires at`. This was optional for `users` and `admins` and `group owners` _could not_ set or enforce this expiration.\n\nWe will also be implementing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/250480, which will make the programmatic, backend enforcement job _optional_. This will help avoid disruptive default behaviors in GitLab to preserve the developer experience as a default experience. This issue adds a toggle to make automatic enforcement of an SSH key expiring _optional_ or not.\n\nThis issue - #1007 - adds an `admin area` policy enforcement capability to GitLab. Once all three of these issues exist, the experience will be:\n\n1. An `admin` defines an instance-wide SSH key expiration policy (#1007; this issue)\n1. An `admin` sets enforcement of SSH keys (when they reach the expiration date) _optional_. This means an SSH key can expire but alternative alerts will be used to notify stakeholders without automatically deleting the key. This is minimally disruptive to developers and is an _optional_ setting.\n1. A `user` can optionally set their own expiration date on an SSH key, but it will be subject to any defined instance-level policy. e.g. A `user` can set an SSH key to expire after 45 days, but an instance policy of 30 days will take priority and the user's SSH key will expire after 30 days.\n\n### Future iterations\n\n1. New issue: Generate an email to the `user` 7 days before their SSH key expires\n1. New issue: Generate a batch email to `admins` with `X` number of expired credentials for the week that require attention (if enforcement is optional)\n1. New issue: Create a CLI error message to inform `users` their key is going to expire (7 days prior to expiration)\n1. New issue: Create a CLI error message to inform `users` their key has expired (where enforcement is optional)\n\n### Product tier level\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references\nThis customer has written a custom script to do this and asked if we would support it natively:\nhttps://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000UKiJi\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-13T16:03:47.102Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T04:20:40.099Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T12:35:05.407Z","closed_by":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","UX","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","group::compliance","missed:14.5","potential proposal","priority::2","release post item","section::dev","settings","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"}],"author":{"id":58926,"username":"Haydn","name":"Haydn Mackay","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/58926/H_head_shot2.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Haydn"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"user_notes_count":67,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":27,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1007","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1007","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1007/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/1007/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1007","relative":"#1007","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#1007"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":258,"epic":{"id":502,"iid":258,"title":"Improve an administrator's ability to secure GitLab","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/258","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":2953777,"iid":985,"project_id":278964,"title":"Time tracking: first iteration","description":"### Description\n\nWe want to introduce time tracking in GitLab. This has already been defined in length in #921. In order to ship the first iteration and gather feedback quickly, we need to scale down the feature to its most minimal form and ship it.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### General concepts\n\n* Time tracking comes with two concepts: estimates, and time spent.\n* Time tracking is entered via slash commands.\n* We don't have any configuration whatsoever.\n* We don't have reporting for now.\n* We don't read time tracking data from commit messages.\n\n#### New slash commands\n\nWe will create a bunch of new slash commands:\n* `/estimate 1w 3j 2h 14m`: add an estimate for the task\n* `/spend 3w`: indicate how much time the task took\n* `/spend -3d`: ability to remove time.\n\nTime format follows [Jira convention](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver070/logging-work-on-issues-762877851.html) with the sames rules as they have:\n* Default conversion rates are 1w = 5d and 1d = 8h.\n* If we enter a number without anything else (like 2), we will assume it’s hours.\n* If we enter 40h, we will automatically convert this to 5d.\n* We allow the following time units:\n    * weeks (`w`)\n    * days (`d`)\n    * hours (`h`)\n    * minutes (`m`)\n\nRules about those slash commands\n* `/estimate` can be entered in the body of the issue/MR or in a comment. Only the latest `/estimate` is taken into account, and overrides any other estimates.\n* `/spend` can be entered in the body or in a comment too. Contrary to `/estimate`, we will count the total of each occurrence to calculate the spent time on a task. The total count is calculated every time a `/spend` command is entered.\n* `/spend` can only be defined by project members, in order to prevent having false positive.\n* Issues/MR can have an estimate only, a time spent only or both.\n\n#### System notes when adding an estimate or time spent\n\nWhen we write a slash command, a system message appears at the bottom of the issue/MR\n* In the case of an estimate, `Changed estimate of this issue to 1w 3d 14h`\n* Time spent: `Added 3h of time spent on this issue`\n\n#### Changes in the sidebar of an issue/MR\n\n* We will display both the Estimate and the Time spent totals in the sidebar.\n* This is just informative. This information is not editable but represents the summary of every time mention in the issue/MR.\n* The information in the sidebar is written in a human format: `1w 1d 12h` instead of `435h`.\n\n####  Measures/KPI\n\nWe have to be able to answer\n* how many issues activate time tracking (either through estimates or time spent)\n* how many MRs activate time tracking (either through estimates or time spent)\n\n### Design needed\n\n* We need a design on how we will represent the information in the sidebar\n\n### Mockups\n\nWhen neither estimated or spent has been updated.

Cloning would remove that clunky workflow. \n\n## Proposal\n\n- A new quick action called `/clone` and companion UI element, that you can use in an issue, if you have permissions to do so.\n- When you initiate a clone, you first select which project you want to clone into, with the current project being the default.\n- Once you confirm the target project and clone the issue, a link to the cloned issue via a system note / contained within a success message on the current issue. A separate link is also visible to go directly to edit the issue. If the edit issue link is clicked, initialize the edit form with:\n  - Title\n  - Description\n  - Confidentiality\n  - Author\n  - Milestone\n  - Due Date\n  - Labels\n  - Iteration (needs to be added to the New Issue form)\n  - Assignees\n  - Weight\n  - Health Status\n- The `/clone` quick action supports an additional param `/clone [path]`. If it is not present, the current project is used for the target. If it is set, the path is used for the target. \n\n### Possible MVC breakdown\n\n- Clone w/ quick action. Show success message with link to cloned issue.\n- Clone w/ quick action and optionally include notes. \n- Clone w/ quick action and specify target path.\n- Clone w/ quick action and provide links to both the issue and the direct link to the edit issue view.\n- Clone via UI button and optionally select target project and include checkbox for including system notes. \n\n### UX\n\n![MVC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/74797f4557389093b81c2ac7474e9e86/Issue_List.png)\n\n@hollyreynolds to add final UX\n\n## UX Considerations\n\n- We are proposing consolidating certain global issue actions into a combined drop down menu in the Issue header / sticky title (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233974/). This would be a logical place for the \"Clone\" UI action to live.\n\n### Quick Action edge cases\n\n1. What happens if an issue is created programmatically with the `/clone` quick action present? Given the `/clone` just initiates the workflow for cloning the issue, would we go ahead and create the issue in this instance since we can't redirect to a \"New Issue\" form? \n\n### Alternative considerations\n\nGiven the proposal, you would need to select a target project before going to the new issue form. Why don't we just put the target project field on the new issue form to begin with? Our current UX approach that requires users to navigate to a project before creating an issue is clunky and doesn't feel ideal. Given:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-10-16_at_10.08.32_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/ab9b85b13038f7b15b44a7355410ece4/Screen_Shot_2020-10-16_at_10.08.32_AM.png)\n\nI should be able to select \"New Issue\" and select which project I want to create the issue within. This may be a separate issue, but if we did that first, it would make initiating a clone a bit more intuitive. \n\n## Permissions\n\n- Follow the same permissions model for roles that are able to create issues\n\n## Tier\n\n- ~\"GitLab Core\" because being able to clone an Issue would not impact a purchasing decision by a buyer in one of [our paid tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [X] `/clone` quick action.\n- [ ] UI element to Clone an issue.\n- [ ] Cloning is tied to the Issuable model so we can easily Clone Epics (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9398) and other objects that use the Issuable model. \n- [ ] A bit of future proofing so when new attributes are added to Issuables, they are required to define whether or not they are clonable. If we make this an optional question to answer, it will most likely get overlooked during the initial implementation of the new attribute. \n- [ ] Pajamas First.\n- [ ] GraphQL First.\n- [X] Tests.\n\nNot a hard acceptance criteria, but this does relate to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9421 in that we are refactoring the \"New Issue\" view to use Vue/Pajamas (and ideally GraphQL once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229838 is done)\n\n### Release Notes\n\nIssues have a `copy_meta` data quick action, but it's a bit clunky because it requires you to first create the new issue, copy the ID or path of the issue you want to copy meta data from, then use the quick action. To make generating similar issues more efficient, issues now support a `/clone` quick action to create a new issue in the same project with identical title, description, and meta-data. \n\nBy default, issues are cloned into the same project and do not include system notes and comments. To change the default behavior when cloning:\n\n- Specify a project path -- `/clone gitlab-org/gitlab` -- to clone the issue to a different project. \n- Use the `--with_notes` parameter to copy system notes and comments during the clone. \n\n![clone-issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/601b3f15b5630d28f8ae67417c8beec0/Screen_Shot_2020-12-16_at_4.11.17_PM.png)\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-05T08:30:34.155Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T20:37:02.916Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T16:24:55.885Z","closed_by":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Core","UX","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::plan","direction","documentation","group::project management","internal customer","issues","popular proposal","potential proposal","release post item","release post item::in review","researched [DEPRECATED]","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":158875,"username":"sendilkumarn","name":"sendilkumarn","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/32e6a76c61f41da3beca909251498c60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sendilkumarn"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":168,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":189,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9421","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":2},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 7 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9421","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9421/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/9421/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9421","relative":"#9421","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#9421"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5078,"epic":{"id":163898,"iid":5078,"title":"Create shared pattern for repeating and grouped controls and actions","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5078","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24644505,"iid":15829,"project_id":278964,"title":"Increase diff size limit","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nHistorically, we have set hard limits for diff size in order to ensure performance and a good UX, however, an increasing number of users come across large diff which go beyond these limits and provide a poor experience.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers should have a seamless experience no matter the size of their diff.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThanks to the great work done in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1816, diff load performance has increased significantly and thus increasing limits should not be as costly now.\n\nIncrease both limit for number of lines and size\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/57833\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/80684\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/83179\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/85596\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/85969\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/89525\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/92459\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/118162\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000013aRjG\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/120299\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000004bZPD?srPos=0\u0026srKp=001\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/137400\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/147208","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-05T01:03:25.015Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T13:08:58.658Z","closed_at":"2020-11-04T21:31:20.521Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"labels":["CEO Interest","Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","backend","customer","customer+","devops::create","diff","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.4","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"}],"author":{"id":444214,"username":"MrChrisW","name":"Chris","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/897cd632548832626c1eae1f3bc1da08?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MrChrisW"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":67,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":12,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15829","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15829","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15829/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15829/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#15829","relative":"#15829","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#15829"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2481,"epic":{"id":18186,"iid":2481,"title":"Soften application limits for diffs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2481","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
