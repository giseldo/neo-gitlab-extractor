TYPE_BLOCKS   | issue_2   |\n| issue_3 | TYPE_IS_BLOCKED_BY | issue_1 |  \n\nOn the example above `issue_1` is blocking two other issues using two different types of block.\n\nThe extra relation type adds complexity when querying for blocking/blocked issues as can be seen on `IssueLink` class.  \n\nIf possible we should consider using just one kind of blocking type to make queries simpler and a bit faster.\nWe will still be able to identify if an issue is `blocked` or `blocking` using the `target_id` and `source_id` keys.  \n\nThis task will need migrations. ~~We can get rid of the relation that has less records on database, which is this case is\n`TYPE_BLOCKS =\u003e 1`~~ We can migrate records with `link_type = 2` to have `link_type = 1` and stop saving records with `link_type = 2`:

This page uses [managed licenses api end point](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/managed_licenses.html) . Api end point has field called approval status. Approval status can be either `blacklisted` or `approved`. \n\nSince Whitelist/Blacklist have connotations about value and map to racial terms, we should rename it to `denied` . In that way terminology will be consistent with UI. \n\n## Proposal \n\n- [ ] Support both blacklisted and denied as `approval_status` for [managed licenses api end point](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/managed_licenses.html)\n- [ ] Currently when we deny/approve license via License configuration page, we send `blacklisted` in POST request to api end point. We need to change payload to send `denied` instead of `blaclisted` since api will support `denied` (see screenshot below)\n- [ ] Migrate license policy data from blacklisted to denied  \n- [ ] Make sure denied licenses are blocked when they are introduced in MR. (this is just to a check changing blacklisted  -\u003e denied didn't break functionality)\n- [ ] Deprecate blacklisted approval status (this could be done in another issue)\n\n![image](/uploads/e32da798a2b1b4194101eb5a10ac9f51/image.png)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n* [ ] Remove usage of [LEGACY_CLASSIFICATION_STATUS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6dfb81530a1e43eb9f08bf7c1a1c7c9bb76dbb55/ee/app/models/software_license_policy.rb#L9-12).\n* [ ] Update the #create endpoint of the API to refer to the new terms [source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6dfb81530a1e43eb9f08bf7c1a1c7c9bb76dbb55/ee/lib/api/managed_licenses.rb#L62-63).\n* [ ] Update #update action of API to refer to new terms [source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6dfb81530a1e43eb9f08bf7c1a1c7c9bb76dbb55/ee/lib/api/managed_licenses.rb#L89-90)\n* [ ] Update API endpoints to map from the old terms to the new terms.\n* [ ] Replace usages of `approval_status` with `classification` (stretch goal)\n\n## Involved components\n\n- [Managed licenses api](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/managed_licenses.html)\n- [License Compliance configuration](https://gitlab.com/help/user/compliance/license_compliance/index)\n \n## Testing\n\nManaged license api and License Compliance configuration work as usual","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-03T11:06:06.200Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T17:40:33.517Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T15:19:56.653Z","closed_by":{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","section::sec","secure::parked","type::feature","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This can be done by removing artifacts without `artifacts:paths` in [`build_artifact_entity`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/serializers/evidences/build_artifact_entity.rb#L7-L9). \n\n2) Update the references in CI templates to reflect the above change.

The examples below are do not include future releases.\n\n### Example Project\n\nAn example project is at https://gitlab.com/aarongoldenthal/release-evidence-test, with the various cases outlined below.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIf a tag and release are created together via the GitLab UI, then the release evidence is taken from the last pipeline (in the example project above this was a push pipeline), as expected.\n\nIf a tag is added to an existing commit (whose last push pipeline is complete), and in that pipeline the release is created via the API, the release evidence is taken from the tag pipeline. The evidence is pulled at the point of release creation, even if that pipeline is not complete, and it pulls only the evidence available at that point (e.g. if the release is created after the test stage then it pulls test results from that pipeline, but if the release is created before the test stage or with no test stage then no results are returned).\n\nIn addition to this creating at least non-intuitive, and arguably inconsistent results (since API and UI created releases result in different evidence), the built-in security jobs are not run in tag pipelines.  So, they are included in release evidence created from web UI, but not the API.  \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nReleases should:\n\n- Produce consistent release evidence when created via any available means\n- Allow creation from a tag pipeline and include the appropriate release evidence without having to repeat the tests in that pipeline\n- Pull release evidence from the last push pipeline for a branch that includes the tag, and wait until that pipeline completes if it is not when the release is created.  This allows inclusion of the predefined security and other template jobs, and other test jobs, and only run in pipelines where content is changed.\n  - The release evidence could be pulled from the tag pipeline once complete, but in that case the predefined security and other template jobs need to run in tag pipelines as well (which can add a lot of compute time).\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-02T20:19:15.074Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T03:03:14.377Z","closed_at":"2022-11-21T03:03:14.345Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Release Evidence","SUS::Impacting","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","backend","backend-weight::1","devops::release","frontend","group::release","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We notice that after reopening a merge request, the Gitlab pipeline will run but the status is not reflected in the merge request view (main screen).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOutlined in comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225710#note_675913518\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitLab does not show an accurate pipeline status to merge request page. \nWe noticed that in a flow of:\n- Developer opened an MR “X”\n- Reviewer reviewed it, suggested changes, closed MR “X”\n- Developer pushes commits to address change requests\n- Developer waits to see a CI job to finish successfully (GitLab -\u003e CI -\u003e Pipelines tab and also GitLab -\u003e Ci -\u003e Jobs tab appear to show the right status for the most recently pushed commits)\n- Developer reopened MR “X”\n- Gitlab very often ends with this error message: “Could not retrieve the pipeline status. For troubleshooting steps, read the documentation”.\n- When we go to “Pipelines” for this MR, the pipeline status is correctly reflected. We noticed that this issue persists for very many hours.\n\nWe noticed that the possible workaround is to push a commit when an MR is opened. For example, some MRs left opened, but later pre-merged with “master”, get out of this state.\n\nLeaving the merge request open overnight (and then pushing a few more commits to the branch) also solved the problem.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nShould link the pipeline status (success/fail) to merge request page immediately, instead of needing to wait an excessive amount of time or having to push additional commits.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/f75a00c1262932fba1417698abb8e7e8/image.png)\n\n```\nCould not retrieve the pipeline status. For troubleshooting steps, read the documentation.\n```\nThe documentation link points to [here](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/merge_requests/reviewing_and_managing_merge_requests.md#troubleshooting).\n\n### Proposal\n\nA `isPostMerge` MR  is checking for `mr.ciStatus` which is `undefined` always and we return an error message to the user. We should add a handler for the CI status and return the status of a merge pipeline instead.\n\n`app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/mr_widget_pipeline_container.vue`\n\n```js\nhasCIStatus() {\n  return this.isPostMerge ? !isEmpty(this.mr.mergePipeline.details.status) : this.mr.ciStatus;\n},\n```\n\nAlso may need to make `app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/mr_widget_pipeline.vue` prop `ciStatus` accept both `String` and `Boolean` types.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-02T17:09:39.355Z","updated_at":"2021-10-31T04:21:44.316Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T14:35:42.737Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton

GitlabRoutingHelper Snippet methods","description":"## Summary\n\nThe `GitlabRoutingHelper` provides us with some super useful methods for getting routes for various models, but it would benefit from some refactoring.\n\nIn particular, we have multiple method definitions for url/path variations of the same route - which could be combined into one and instead pass in a `:only_path` option\n\n## Improvements\nThe following are the methods I've identified so far that could be combined:\n\n- `gitlab_raw_snippet_path`\n- `gitlab_snippet_notes_path`\n- `gitlab_snippet_note_path`\n- `gitlab_toggle_award_emoji_snippet_note_path`\n- `gitlab_toggle_award_emoji_snippet_path`\n\n## Risks\n\nWe'd need to also modify each place where these methods are called, to instead call the `*_url` variant with an `only_path: true` option\n\n## Involved components\nAt the time of writing, the following files will be involved:\n\n**`gitlab_raw_snippet_path`**\n- `app/helpers/snippet_blob_presenter.rb:22`\n- `app/helpers/snippets_helper.rb:16`\n- `app/helpers/gitlab_routing_helper.rb`\n- `app/helpers/gitlab_routing_helper_spec.rb`\n\n**`gitlab_snippet_notes_path`**\n- `app/helpers/notes_helper.rb:105`\n- `app/helpers/notes_helper.rb:136`\n\n**`gitlab_snippet_note_path`**\n- `app/helpers/notes_helper.rb:115`\n\n**`gitlab_toggle_award_emoji_snippet_note_path`**\n- `app/helpers/award_emoji_helper.rb:10`\n\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\nThis will reduce the number of lines in `GitlabRoutingHelper` and the duplication of code, which will make it easier to read","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-02T12:38:43.135Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T16:06:08.195Z","closed_at":"2020-07-02T14:11:47.135Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay

Currently, the ordering of the metadata can make it difficult to quickly digest.\n\n| Current UI |\n|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2020-07-02_at_14.10.11](/uploads/e8469ebdd42b1dd9422a2802cebb340d/Screen_Shot_2020-07-02_at_14.10.11.png)|\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user should be able to understand all of the metadata related to a package quickly and at a glance.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nChange the ordering of the Package Detail metadata to the following: \n1. Package Format\n1. Package Size\n1. Project Name\n1. Origin Branch\n1. Tags\n\nNote: Tags are last because they have a different UI composition. The labels being farthest right help maintain a visual rhythm.\n\n| Package Detail Header W/O \"Tag\" Label |\n|---|\n|![227582_-_New_Package_Detail__1_](/uploads/699c40bdc5380627959474d890db2127/227582_-_New_Package_Detail__1_.png)|\n\n### Further details\n\nTo further clean the UI, we're removing the [Tag icon](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~tag) and the tag count from the metadata section.

That subgroup is a child of the group the user is currently looking at.\n\n| UI with single sub-group project child relationship |\n|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2020-07-02_at_12.23.27](/uploads/955cbf96cde1e463c56b90eacf729307/Screen_Shot_2020-07-02_at_12.23.27.png)|\n\nIn our rarest case, users will view a package that has a more complex hierarchy. After the first Sub-Group is displayed, an ellipses icon will be used similar to the breadcrumb navigation to show all of the n+2 subgroups.\n\n| UI with multiple subgroups included |\n|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2020-07-02_at_12.25.49](/uploads/45d42ad064b2aac58d38266758760c9e/Screen_Shot_2020-07-02_at_12.25.49.png)|\n\n\nWe should also include a tooltip on hover that displays the entire path of the related project from instance -\u003e group -\u003e subgroup -\u003e project\n\n| Tooltip hover example |\n|---|\n|![image](/uploads/c974aedd6080c357a6adb69f240c3d7c/image.png)|\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/a\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdating screenshots in the documentation may be needed when discussing the group level view. \n\n@nmezzopera @trizzi - If we go with this breakdown, do you think the documentation should include a note explaining the elipses icon will show all of the sub-groups between the first sub-group and the project name?\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nn/a\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers will be able to more easily identify the project/sub-group relationship of a package compared to the group they're viewing.

Redis","description":"### Problem\n\nDuring https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/418#note_371299552 investigation I've noticed that `Projects::MergeRequestsController#discussions` is the top Redis `cache` reader (taking around 45% in the context of the top 3 actions), reading an average of 20gb per day.\n\nLooking at the last 2 hours for instance, I can see a single project constantly reading _20MB_, taking 6 seconds avg for each request:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-01_at_20.48.37](/uploads/79a4a9067d1ef4f0fdf142597ec67ea7/Screen_Shot_2020-07-01_at_20.48.37.png)\n[source](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/8ed1ffbdda5bd32ccde730993f919003)\n\nThis negatively impacts our Redis cache instances considering we'll read as long as these MR discussions goes.\n\n### Proposals\n\n#### Persist in DB and Redis just what is needed\n\nCurrently we persist the discussion diff in the DB, then cache its highlighted version in Redis.\n\nWhen persisting this diff we take everything [from very first line of the diff until the commented line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/643322b4678265d75295d3b7c93ad89b35261203/lib/gitlab/diff/file.rb#L102). So imagine that if a MR has 200 comments in the middle of big files, we'll end up with a considerable amount of data persisted.\n\nThat happens because it's not simple to rebuild the diff file if it doesn't have the diff header ([see how we parse diffs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/diff/parser.rb)). But, if we rebuild the diff with a custom header, trim every other line (leaving just a few, say, 5 lines in total) like we [do with suggestions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/diff/suggestion_diff.rb#L21), then persist, we'll then be able to feed that into the same parser mentioned earlier. As an outcome:\n\n1. Reduce the amount of data persisted in DB\n2. Reduce the IO with Redis and DB\n3. Improve response time in the process\n\n#### Hard limit number of discussions\n\nCurrently we don't have limits for how much is loaded from `Projects::MergeRequestsController#discussions`, meaning that one could send an indefinite amount of discussions in MRs put pressure in a considerable amount of services at once.\n\n### Status on Close\n\nThe original problem of persisting/reading too much data from Redis was mitigated by introducing compression. The long term challenge of being more efficient with the data (and then removing the need for compression) will be addressed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247497.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-02T00:23:42.714Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T10:40:35.122Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T12:11:08.911Z","closed_by":{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel Nienaber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2722370/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rnienaber"},"labels":["Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","backend","bug::performance","corrective action","devops::create","group::scalability","group::source code","infradev","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"}],"author":{"id":11493,"username":"oswaldo","name":"Oswaldo Ferreira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/oswaldo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225600","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225600","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225600/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225600/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225600","relative":"#225600","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225600"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":53205082,"iid":225584,"project_id":278964,"title":"Retrieve security dashboard URL used on Project Severity status report from backend - BE implementation","description":"The following discussion from !35031 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @afontaine started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35031#note_368958507):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e Hmm I've never really seen us try to construct a URL to something in Vue.

I've been able to try this out successfully. But, I find the workflow really hard to manage when there is more than one project.\n\nFor example, I have two projects that have each published Python modules to their respective registries. Now, I want to use these published modules in a third project. I have to configure a separate repository or specify a separate index-url for each source project, because the repository endpoints are project specific.\n\nHere's the Registry Setup verbiage provided in one of the projects. Note that the repository is specific to project ID `898`.\n\n\u003e If you haven't already done so, you will need to add the below to your .pypirc file.\n\u003e ```\n\u003e [gitlab]\n\u003e repository = https://gitlab.transzap.com/api/v4/projects/898/packages/pypi\n\u003e username = __token__\n\u003e password = \u003cyour personal access token\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e For more information on the PyPi registry, see the documentation.\n\nUnlike the Docker container registry where users log in to a single point (`registry.gitlab.com` or equivalent) and then have access to images across multiple GitLab projects subject to role permissions, the Python PyPi repositories have individual access points per GitLab project.\n\nThe per-project repository endpoint is really burdensome to manage when I want to use modules in more than one GitLab project.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nIt should be possible to pull Python modules from multiple projects without specifying an index per project. Otherwise, module users have to know which project each module comes from by project ID, and manually manage a potentially long list of index URLs.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI would like a common repository endpoint that allows me to pull Python modules from multiple projects. This could be instance wide like the Docker registry, or at the group level.\n\n### Further details\n\nAn install of three modules from three projects in the same group looks like this right now.\n\n```\npip install \\\n    --extra-index-url https://$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_USERNAME:$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_PASSWORD@gitlab.transzap.com/api/v4/projects/897/packages/pypi/simple \\\n    --extra-index-url https://$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_USERNAME:$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_PASSWORD@gitlab.transzap.com/api/v4/projects/898/packages/pypi/simple \\\n    --extra-index-url https://$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_USERNAME:$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_PASSWORD@gitlab.transzap.com/api/v4/projects/899/packages/pypi/simple \\\n    dagster-aws-ext dagster-dask-ext dagster-pandas-ext\n```\n\nA hypothetical group-level index should allow me to install all three modules with one index URL.\n\n```\npip install \\\n    --extra-index-url https://$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_USERNAME:$GITLAB_PYPI_INDEX_PASSWORD@gitlab.transzap.com/api/v4/groups/259/packages/pypi/simple \\\n    dagster-aws-ext dagster-dask-ext dagster-pandas-ext\n```\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nAccess to the modules should still follow the project each module lives in, like how Docker images are handled.\n\n### Documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIt should be easy to use modules from multiple projects published in GitLab PyPi package registries. Users should not have to manage multiple indexes.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nGitLab PyPi Repository is available in GitLab Silver/Premium.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n### Links / references\nhttps://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000KvacF\n\n* [GitLab PyPi Repository](https://gitlab.transzap.com/help/user/packages/pypi_repository/index.md)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-01T17:25:59.862Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T20:46:49.717Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T17:42:41.389Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","GitLab Core","Package:P1","PyPI Repository","backend","customer","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":698073,"username":"kinghuang","name":"King Chung Huang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6cf73c6b7c802f28c6be9320c2c1e5f3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kinghuang"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":27,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225545","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225545","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225545/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225545/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225545","relative":"#225545","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225545"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":53106875,"iid":225543,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add frontend validation to \"Restrict membership by email\" field in Group -\u003e Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Permissions, LFS, 2FA","description":"The following discussion from !35543 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @alexbuijs started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35543#note_371748853):  (+2 comments)\n\n\u003e I was thinking about a frontend validation.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n#### Acceptance criteria\n- Pipelines run for a fork ref will receive a `fork` badge\n- The badge is colored blue (info)\n- The badge makes use of the new `small` [badge component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/badge)\n- The fork badge will feature a tooltip with `Pipeline ran in fork of project`\n- This badge will be propagated throughout any place pipeline badges are shown (pipeline table views, pipeline detail view info wells)\n\n| Mockup (browser made)   |\n| --- |\n| ![image](/uploads/16c659e9b8312e58ef4f57ace527b4ae/image.png) |\n| Mockups might differ, please check the acceptance criteria :pray: |\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis makes this issue closely related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225497\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

security dashboard URL used on Project Severity status report from backend - FE implementation","description":"The following discussion from !35031 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @afontaine started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35031#note_368958507):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e Hmm I've never really seen us try to construct a URL to something in Vue. Is there anyway we can get this path from the backend? If not, can we pull it out into a function and save some of it as constants instead?\n\n\n## Extra context\n\nWe have to construct the URL in the frontend since GraphQL misses this information. I believe the correct way to handle this should be to provide this information in GraphQL - for that reason I believe this task requires ~backend work.\n\nThe file where we have a manual implementation is: `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/first_class_vulnerability_severities.vue` and the line is this:\n\n```\n\u003cgl-link target=\"_blank\" :href=\"`/${project.fullPath}/-/security/dashboard`\"\u003e{{project.nameWithNamespace}}\u003c/gl-link\u003e\n```\n\nWe basically need to fetch the endpoint from GraphQL and replace this line with the fetched data instead of manual URL construction.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-01T13:07:48.351Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:10:59.316Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T02:41:45.723Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Database","Category:Vulnerability Management","Community contribution","devops::secure","frontend","group::threat insights","section::sec","security dashboard","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":2190515,"username":"KevSlashNull","name":"Kev","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f3861b3746ee5f779cbdcf1efa4a2a1e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/KevSlashNull"},{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"}],"author":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2190515,"username":"KevSlashNull","name":"Kev","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f3861b3746ee5f779cbdcf1efa4a2a1e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/KevSlashNull"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225493","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225493","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225493/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/225493/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#225493","relative":"#225493","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#225493"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
