Previously any user could schedule unlimited amount of scheduled pipelines that runs every 5 min In GitLab 14.0, we are limiting the time interval for schedule pipeline to be 1hr minimum\n\n\n* The limitation will be enforced for free tier (SaaS) only.\n* Existing configuration will not be changed. \n* There would be no cap for paid users.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWithout application limits on schedule pipelines they can be scheduled to run at a frequency that causes harmful load on GitLab.com's shared runners that can potentially become a DOS attack that must be disabled.\n\n\n### Further details\n\nAs part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3800 we've seen some [cron patterns with a high frequency](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/12705#note_518492122) which was causing a load on our GitLab.com shared runner fleet, causing a GitLab to DOS itself because of these harmful cron patterns. During the incident we ended up [disabling this high-frequency cron expressions](https://twitter.com/gitlabstatus/status/1365679359848116224). It was discussed during the incident that as a ~\"corrective action\" it would be good to disallow such expressions so no one can create a harmful schedule pipeline.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nSet a rate limit on pipeline schedules as part of ~\"Application Limits\" (self-managed instances is out of scope).  \nThe implementation is for SaaS only, the default for GitLab.com will be:\n- ~~10 schedules per project daily for Free tier users only~~ Already implemented \n- Time interval cant go below 1hr.\n- No cap for paid. \n\n\nWe should automatically adjust any new scheduler using a corn job that is less than 1hr. In addition in the Schedule pipeline, we should add a generic message that will inform the user that the configuration is invalid, the banner will contain a link to the section in the documentation that explains the limitation of a scheduled pipeline.\n\n\n### Potential enhancement - (only if it doesn't complicate the MVC)\nDisplay the banner for paid users when:\n- Paid user tries to create a cron job that is less than 5min.\nThe existing experience today is that we automatically adjust the pipeline to run every 5min without notifying the user.\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n- Add a notification bar when setting up an unsupported cron job for schedule pipelines \n\n\n\nInstance admins can set ~\"Application Limits\" for [schedule pipeline feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html) via the Rails console, as it happens today for other application limits.\n\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe should document this limitation at docs https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/#gitlab-cicd\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nOnly instance admins can see/edit the ~\"Application Limits\" for pipeline schedules.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\nTBD, we'll need to better define how the product is going to respond to pipeline build frequencies that exceed our threshold before we can complete this section. \n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

Until now, Agent registration could be removed only through the GraphQL API. GitLab now ships with a UI-based approach to remove an Agent registration. \n\nOnce an Agent is removed from GitLab, its related tokens are invalidated, and the given connection stops working immediately.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen the users uninstall an agent from their cluster, the Agent remains in the Agent listing but at that point it is not valid nor useful. To allow the users to declutter the Agent list from unused Agents we should introduce the ability to delete them.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n- Provide the ability to delete an Agent record.\n- Warn the user if the agent has any active connections.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

In this release, we've added support for merging rules array `!reference`, which lets you target the rules configuration you want to reuse as apart of your CI/CD pipeline, even if it's in another file.\n\n\n### Summary\n\nIssue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/266173 introduced the `!reference` notation to re-use job sections.  This works well for the `script`-related tags and some other cases as noted in the documentation, but in the case of `rules` doesn't work (and maybe some other places), or at least doesn't work as expected per the documentation.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen trying to `!refence` a `rules` array a syntax error is reported. For example:\n\n```yaml\n.no_schedule:\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == \"schedule\"\n      when: never\n    - when: on_success\n\njob1:\n  image: alpine:latest\n  rules:\n    - !reference [.no_schedule, rules]\n  script:\n      - echo \"run except schedules and tags\"\n```\n\nfails linting with the error `This GitLab CI configuration is invalid: jobs:job1 rules should be an array of hashes.`\n\nIt appears, assuming the merged YAML view is correct (a great feature BTW), that this is because with the current implementation `!reference` doesn't flatten arrays merged into an array element, it inserts the referenced array creating a nested array.  For example, this script:\n\n```yaml\n.my_script:\n  script:\n    - echo \"foo\"\n    - echo \"bar\"\n  after_script:\n    - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n\njob4:\n  image: alpine:latest\n  before_script:\n    - !reference [.my_script, after_script]\n  script:\n    - !reference [.my_script, script]\n    - echo \"after foo and bar\"\n    - !reference [.my_script, after_script]\n```\n\nresults in the following merged job with various nested arrays in `before_script` and `script`\n\n```yaml\n:job4:\n  :image: alpine:latest\n  :before_script:\n  - - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n  :script:\n  - - echo \"foo\"\n    - echo \"bar\"\n  - echo \"after foo and bar\"\n  - - echo $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n```\n\nThe various `script` properties can accept nested arrays of strings (per the linter), so this executes as expected, but `rules` does not as noted in the error above.\n\nThe only ways to to use `!reference` with `rules` appears to be either reference only a rule list with syntax like that shown below, which does not allow merging of rules (at least I couldn't find a syntax that worked)\n\n```yaml\n.no_schedule:\n  rules:\n    -

Making a new task from the board view opens a sidebar. Previously, from this sidebar I was able to directly assign team members to tasks. Currently, that functionality is bugged and only shows myself. However, by typing in the search field for a team member, it brings up every GitLab user account. If I type in the exact usernames of my team members I am able to assign tasks to them, but it feels as if this is a workaround and unintended.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Have a project with team members added\n2. Go to the boards view\n3. Create a task in a column\n4. Focus on the task in the boards view to open the sidebar\n5. From the sidebar, attempt to change the assignee of the task\n6. Bug manifests itself as team members are not focused\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIn the sidebar, team members are not shown and searching for a member to assign a task to searches the entirety of GitLab.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe sidebar scope should be limited to your team members on private repositories. Searching for assignees should bring up only your team members.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-26T07:40:50.687Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:07:36.220Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T14:46:34.941Z","closed_by":{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","boards","customer","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"}],"author":{"id":2329001,"username":"mabdulrahim","name":"Muhammad Abdul-Rahim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2329001/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mabdulrahim"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322960","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322960","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322960/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322960/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322960","relative":"#322960","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322960"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79838913,"iid":322953,"project_id":278964,"title":"Better educate users on the purpose of the `busy` feature through copy tweaks","description":"### Challenge\n\nHow might we better educate users on the purpose of the `busy` feature?

It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-25T17:09:42.302Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T15:22:51.259Z","closed_at":"2021-03-25T14:23:26.374Z","closed_by":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","GitLab Core","devops::verify","feature::addition","group::pipeline insights","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"}],"author":{"id":4061070,"username":"rickywiens","name":"Ricky Wiens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4061070/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rickywiens"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322895","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322895","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322895/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322895/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322895","relative":"#322895","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322895"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4155,"epic":{"id":91690,"iid":4155,"title":"Test History for MRs and Pipelines MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4155","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79821326,"iid":322893,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add diff-filter=d to lefthook files config","description":"## Description\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54340#note_510307275\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nI also think it should have `--diff-filter=d` in order to avoid running on deleted files.\n\nI am unfamiliar with `--diff-filter=d` but looking at it sounds right to me to have it.

Summary\n\nWe have [around `800TB`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322817#note_527363019)([80 millions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322817#note_526892388) records) of removable artifacts that can't be removed because of [inefficient database queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47496).\n\n[`Ci::DestroyExpiredJobArtifactsService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a5f6d19bfe8011ef30b8e144306a4a0d39bfee45/app/services/ci/destroy_expired_job_artifacts_service.rb) is triggered [every 7 minutes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/cd34f1eba9b24e03ad30bb17a875e26c6bbf4c10/config/initializers/1_settings.rb#L432-433) to remove __expired and unlocked__ artifacts. It looks at 100000 artifacts that have the `expire_at` value less than the current timestamp and it selects the ones that are `unlocked`. This is not efficient because it can't reach artifacts with an older `expire_at` value. It's not possible to add another index for this query because we need to join three large tables to gather the data.\n\n## Improvements\n\nAs part of #327281 we:\n\n- Added a new `locked` column to `ci_job_artifacts` and created a partial index on it that will allow us to query for unlocked and expired artifacts more efficiently (!70235)\n- Started populating the new `locked` column on `ci_job_artifacts` when new artifacts are created and when pipelines are unlocked (!72406)\n\n## Remaining work\n\nThe preferred approach to this cleanup is to add some sort of process that will iterate through old pipelines and artifacts, that would otherwise likely never be touched, and mark the artifacts as `unlocked` so they can be deleted by the [now-more-performant DestroyAllExpiredService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327281#note_667864228).\n\nOur preferred options here include:\n\n1. Adding a new background worker that will iterate through all old pipelines and marking their ci_job_artifact record `locked` statuses, and we completely remove the worker in a release or two once it's job is done.\n\n2. We add some code to our now-more-performant DestroyAllExpired service to iterate through old pipelines and marking their ci_job_artifact record `locked` statuses with the remainder of the 5-minute execution window, letting it time out. This will chip away at the `locked = unknown` records in `ci_job_artifacts`, allowing those to be properly destroyed by the DestroyAllExpiredService on it's next execution. Additionally, if the artifact being set to unlocked is expired, we can remove it straight away while we have it loaded in memory.\n  * Adding a partial index on `ci_job_artifacts WHERE locked = (unknown)` will help with this. Initially, the index will be very large because it will have nearly every artifact in the table. However over time, the index will shrink and executions will become relatively faster, because we'll be looking for a smaller proportion of the existing records and not wanting to do sequential scans. When the index is empty, we can remove it at our convenience.\n\n3. We write a background migration to iterate through all old pipelines and marking their ci_job_artifact record `locked` statuses. This has database performance risks that we would need to evaluate.\n\nIf neither of those things are possible for whatever reason:\n\n4. We wrangle an SRE to do it manually, and figure out how to instruct self-hosted customers to do the same. This is not ideal for both our own workflow and that of our self-hosted customers.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-25T00:23:05.084Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T09:34:27.851Z","closed_at":"2022-04-08T17:53:42.622Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"labels":["CI artifacts","Category:Build Artifacts","Category:Continuous Integration","Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","FY23::Q1","Pricing \u0026 Packaging","SaaS","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","infradev","maintenance::refactor","missed-SLO","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","missed:14.5","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","missed:14.9","priority::2","reliability","section::ops","severity::2","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"}],"author":{"id":5709468,"username":"cheryl.li","name":"Cheryl Li","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709468/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cheryl.li"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":162,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-04-08","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322817","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322817","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322817/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322817/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322817","relative":"#322817","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322817"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7097,"epic":{"id":381726,"iid":7097,"title":"Improve expire_at behavior for self hosted GitLab instances so wanted artifacts are not deleted","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7097","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79749684,"iid":322815,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make `Billable Members Count` available for subgroups via API","description":"## Problem\n\nToday, it's challenging for customers to understand what billable members contribute to each Group's total user count.

Refer to who is a billable member on each member list item in the group admin interface (e.g. https://gitlab.com/groups/**/-/group_members)\n1. Update the high-level group view (e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org) to show billable user counts in addition to total group members to administrators.\n\n## Reference\n\n1. [Namespace by ID API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/namespaces.html#get-namespace-by-id) \n     1. Is available with an access token to users with `Owner`+ role\n     1. Provides data for Group and Subgroups, not projects.\n     1. Available for both self-managed and SaaS\n1. `billable_members_count` \n     1. Returns data for the immediate group being queried and nested membership as well.\n     1. When generated for a root Group, returns the sum total of membership for the entire namespace. This includes the direct membership/invited groups at the root group + direct membership/invited groups of all subgroups and projects beneath the root group.\n     1. When generated for a Sub Group, returns the sum total of: direct member count/invited groups at the subgroup level + the subgroup creator (technically inherited) + direct member count from nested descendants (subgroup or project).\n     1. Does not return inherited membership from parent.\n1. `members_count_with_descendants` \n     1. Direct membership of the group + descendant members of nested subgroups.\n     1. Does not include invited group membership.\n     1. Does not include descendant members of nested projects.\n     1. This feels like a bug, I can't imagine this metric, in this form is intended.\n1. `seats_in_use` \n     1. Is only returned for root namespace, not subgroup.\n     1. Should be the same value as `billable_members_count` for the root namespace.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-24T23:27:54.456Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T05:13:17.599Z","closed_at":"2021-04-07T11:41:05.295Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["#field-fyi","Deliverable","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","section::fulfillment","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":5413970,"username":"justinfarris","name":"Justin Farris","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5413970/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justinfarris"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322815","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322815","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322815/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322815/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322815","relative":"#322815","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322815"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5506,"epic":{"id":214803,"iid":5506,"title":"v1 Build SM billable users foundation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5506","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79748646,"iid":322811,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update \"Security Scanner Integration\" developer docs with new exit codes","description":"\u003c!--\n\n* Use this issue template for suggesting new docs or updates to existing docs.\n  Note: Doc work as part of feature development is covered in the Feature Request template.\n\n* For issues related to features of the docs.gitlab.com site, see\n     https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/issues/\n\n* For information about documentation content and process, see\n     https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/ --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDeveloper docs should be updated so that integrators developing security scanners make their scanners exit with a specific exit code when the scan succeeds but vulnerabilities are found.\n\n### Further details\n\n[Current secure exit codes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html#exit-code)\n\n| Orchestrator Exit Code | Description                      |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 3                      | No match, no compatible analyzer |\n| 4                      | Project directory empty          |\n| 5                      | No compatible Docker image       |\n\nSpecific codes will have a specific shared meaning across all AST for the purpose of helping customers more easily handle making changes to all AST items\n\nNote that today 0 is \n\n* 0 = Job succeeded and there were no findings \\[0 is currently what we say success is \"Following the POSIX exit code standard, the scanner exits with 0 for success and any number from 1 to 255 for anything else.

The others are ignored.\n\nWhen a user needs to import 2 or more certificates for their private repo, there is no way for them to do this using the [documented solution](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#using-a-custom-ssl-ca-certificate-authority).\n\nNote: there is a workaround. The user must manually import the certificates using `keytool` in the `before_script` section of their ci configuration. For example:\n\n```yaml\ngemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning:\n  before_script:\n    - OIFS=$IFS; IFS=; echo $ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE \u003e multi.pem; IFS=$OIFS # read the ci var into a file\n    - csplit -z --digits=2 --prefix=cert multi.pem \"/-----END CERTIFICATE-----/+1\" \"{*}\" # split into multiple certs (cert00, cert01, etc.)\n    - . $HOME/.bashrc # source bash so that can load asdf and load keytool\n    - for i in `ls cert*`; do keytool -v -importcert -alias \"custom-cert-$i\" -file $i -trustcacerts -noprompt -storepass changeit -keystore /opt/asdf/installs/java/adoptopenjdk-11.0.7+10.1/lib/security/cacerts; done # import each cert \n    - export ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE=\"\" # unset the var so that the analyzer does not do its own import\n```\n\nThis needs to be fixed to allow users to add multiple keys in the variable.\n\nOriginal report: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321270\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Add multiple ca certs to `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE`.\n1. Run gemnasium-maven analyzer.\n1. In the after_script section check whether these have been imported.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly the first cert in the certificate list is imported. The others are ignored.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll certificates should be imported.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nSplit the variable before importing into keytool. Split along the certificate boundary and run `keytool -import` for each derived certificate.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] split certificates in the pem file written for `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` into constituent certificates (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/master/keystore/keystore.go#L19)\n- [ ] for every found certificate do `keytool -importcert` to add to the java keystore\n- [ ] add an integration test for this functionality by adding a `FREEZE` branch to a triggered test project (e.g. `java-maven`) by setting the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` variable and verifying that these are set in the keystore after analyzer run\n- [ ] release new version of `gemnasium-maven`","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-24T20:18:56.813Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T07:09:20.689Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T17:44:32.984Z","closed_by":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::2","release post item","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","wontfix","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"}],"author":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322791","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322791","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322791/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322791/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322791","relative":"#322791","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322791"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79742648,"iid":322790,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rename Operations to Monitor in the project-level left navigation","description":"\u003c!-- Actionable insights must recommend an action that needs to take place. An actionable insight both defines the insight and clearly calls out action or next step required to improve based on the result of the research observation or data. Actionable insights are tracked over time and will include follow-up. Learn more in the handbook here: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/research-insights/#actionable-insights --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\nRename `Operations` to `Monitor` in the project-level left sidebar.\n\n### Why?\n`Operations` is a broad category label that does not match the scope of the rest of the left navigation. Most other items in the left navigation are feature names (e.g. Merge Requests, Issues, Wiki) or categories with a more targeted scope (e.g. CI/CD, Packages \u0026 Registries). In several research studies conducted on the left navigation, we have observed low task success rates for items that live under `Operations`.\n\nAdditionally, in upcoming releases, multiple `Operations` items will be moved out into separate top-level nav items labeled `Deployments` and `Infrastructure`. The majority of the remaining items are strongly associated with monitoring, observability, and incident management. \n\nWe also have a global Operations nav item that is different from the items that would remain under Operations.\n\n### Supporting evidence\nIn a [first-click test of project-level Operations](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/b8bcffd8-a6d0-41f6-a5cd-09c37aa48082/insights/present/35a78e69-e3e5-4a3b-bb9a-ece89501dd23) nav items, the proposed structure performed better than the existing structure. This provided justification for breaking down the `Operations` category.\n\nWith the decision to move 7 items out of the current `Operations` menu, the following items would remain:\n- Metrics\n- Logs\n- Alerts\n- Tracing\n- Incidents \n\nThe remaining items are mainly associated with monitoring, observability, and incident management. \n\n### Considerations \n- This change would need to come after https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225307 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246813 are complete.\n- `Observability` may also be a fitting category name since it can cover a broader scope. However, `Monitoring` may be more familiar to the general population of GitLab users.\n   - [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) research](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-measurement-monitoring-and-observability) defines these terms as follows:\n      - Monitoring is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to watch and understand the state of their systems. Monitoring is based on gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs.\n      - Observability is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined in advance.\n- Does it make sense to go from `Operations` to separate items for `Monitoring` and `Incident Management`?  \n  - Pros: This may provide more clarity to users. \n  - Cons: This would add more items to the left sidebar which could contribute to the problem of users feeling overwhelmed.\n \n### Resources\n \u003c!--Add resources as links below or as related issues. --\u003e\n\n- :dove: [Dovetail project](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/b8bcffd8-a6d0-41f6-a5cd-09c37aa48082/insights/present)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-24T20:15:09.440Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T20:57:19.799Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T05:37:55.150Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","automation:ml","closed::complete","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":1851795,"username":"katokpara","name":"Katherine Okpara","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1851795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/katokpara"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322790","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322790","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322790/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322790/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322790","relative":"#322790","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322790"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5647,"epic":{"id":229847,"iid":5647,"title":"Create:Editor -- 13.11 - 14.0 -- Update Left Sidebar","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5647","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79740994,"iid":322787,"project_id":278964,"title":"Pagination not working under Branches section","description":"### Summary\n\nPagination under branches for tabs Active, Stale, All not working\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Quality MR widget: Base pipeline artifact not found error should depend on backend status","description":"### Context\n\nWe are in the process of [moving the code quality report comparison logic to the backend](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271077), this is behind the [feature flag `:codequality_backend_comparison`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300796) for now.\n\nThere should be an error message that shows when there is no code quality artifact available for the base pipeline:\n\n![image](/uploads/b0ec20cf35635e99f59d3b05d4d5d862/image.png)\n\n(i.e. the artifact from the pipeline of the `master` commit that the MR's branch is based on is not available, because the code quality job didn't run on `master`, or because the artifact has expired, etc.)\n\n### Proposal \n\nWe should make this error message depend on the new backend comparison `status` and/or `status_reason`, because right now it depends on the presence of the path used to download the artifact for comparison, and we intend to remove that path when we remove the `:codequality_backend_comparison` feature flag because we won't need to download the artifact any more.\n\n**Options:**\n- Display the exact same popover when the report status is `not_found`\n- Take the error message from the popover, but display it directly in the widget when the report status is `not_found` (which also addresses #293716)\n- Remove frontend popover code altogether, get the ~backend to return the message as a `status_reason` (similarly to what we do for [`\"This merge request does not have codequality reports\"`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/merge_request.rb#L1572), which would [appear in the body of the

additional DB table (acceleration structure) to optimise job queueing (as an intermediate solution for better queueing)","description":"Currently we have very expensive query run on top of `ci_builds` where we (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3712):\n\n- look for matching projects\n- look for pending builds\n- match tags\n- match other filters\n- look at quota\n\nThis is a problem:\n\n- `ci_builds` is expensive to access: this is very wide table that often times out\n- `ci_builds` cannot be partitioned as otherwise we would not be able to fetch all jobs\n- for accessing `tags` we cross-join another table `taggings`\n- for accessing quota we cross-join `project/namespace`\n- we check access level based on `project/namespace`\n\nAs a way to accelerate filtering:\n\n- Introduce `ci_pending_builds` table\n- Design table so we would not have to load `ci_builds` (a very wide table) as part of query as part of `RegisterJobService` for filtering\n- We would still load `ci_builds` for the purpose of accepting build, but the filtering should be significantly faster and provide more capacity\n- This would allow us to make `ci_builds` partitioned without breaking queueing\n- Table would consist as much data as possible to perform build matching: at least `tags`, `protected`, `project_id`, and whatever else is needed\n- Insert build to table on status transition to `pending` as part of state machine\n- Delete item from table on status transition from `pending` as part of state machine\n- Change `RegisterJobService` to filter using `ci_pending_builds` instead of `ci_builds`\n- We assume that queries would have a significantly lower cost, as we would have much easier and cheaper to access data, and be able to hold this pending queue in memory of postgres for quick filtering\n\nThis acceleration structure is proposed as a follow-up on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/3712. If designed properly this could be used for all future work on queueing as well.\nThis can be an easy way to improve performance today without spending a lot of effort on it.\n\nThis can be a way to improve performance today, with a potential throw-away solution without a lot of impact on a codebase (hopefully)_.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-24T17:26:15.980Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:43:37.209Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T16:02:19.354Z","closed_by":{"id":263716,"username":"grzesiek","name":"Grzegorz Bizon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/263716/avatar.jpeg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/grzesiek"},"labels":["Category:Application Performance","auto updated","automation:ml","devops::data_stores","group::application performance","rapid action","section::enablement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzci≈Ñski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322766","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322766","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322766/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/322766/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#322766","relative":"#322766","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#322766"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6167,"epic":{"id":287358,"iid":6167,"title":"Decomposition: CI Tables","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6167","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":79729502,"iid":322760,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update references to \"issuable_vue_app:change\" to use constant","description":"## Context\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52135#note_493847316 we encapsulated the event string `\"issuable_vue_app:change\"` in a constant, but the constant is only referenced in a single module.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

We need to refactor it to Vue so we can:\n\n- Add OR/multi-select filtering, which requires the use of the `gitlab-ui` component `GlFilteredSearch`\n- Add new features more easily, such as adding support for default issue types\n\nThe refactoring is done under the feature flag `vue_issues_list` which is defaulted to off.\n\nThere was an earlier attempt at refactoring the issues page under the `vue_issuables_list` feature flag, which renders the issue cards in Vue. However, the difference between this and the `vue_issues_list` feature flag is that the `vue_issues_list` flag additionally renders 1) the open/closed/all tabs, 2) action buttons including the csv import/export buttons, 3) search bar including sort dropdown in Vue (everything is rendered in Vue except the bulk edit sidebar which is still in Haml + jQuery). The reason why we weren't able to continue using the earlier `vue_issuables_list` feature flag is because a reusable issuable list Vue app was created (`issuable_list_root.vue`) and became the SSoT reusable component for this kind of issues list UI pattern. Unfortunately, the code behind the `vue_issuables_list` feature flag doesn't use `issuable_list_root.vue` and it was easier to start from scratch with a new feature flag.\n\nTasks:\n\n- [x] Add

Using scanner-specific rows\n\nSince this is a spike, the plan isn't concrete. But in general, the approach to investigate will move user-facing strings to the ~frontend, and to move away from the `feature` abstraction and use concrete scanner-specific rows. The old implementation is column-centric, leading to [various code smells](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/e500edf7284e42be812fd2d8c9735007bce3b4de/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/components/manage_feature.vue#L31-35); this rearchitecturing will be row/scanner-centric.\n\n- Create scanner-specific rows for the configuration table\n- Move user-facing strings out of [`ConfigurationPresenter`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/707f87461c959a133970698b5a4387bda56560bf/ee/app/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter.rb#L12-53) to ~frontend rows\n\n### 2. Using scanner-specific cells\n\nThis is closer to what the CE implementation does already, though for both the Status _and_ Manage cells. This was the approach taken in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55623.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [x] Open follow-up issue(s) to implement new architecture (unless the effort can just be done and finished off as part of this issue)\n   - [x] Move name, description and help page paths from ~backend to ~frontend (and sharing between CE/EE frontends)\n   - [x] Move scanner status strings from ~backend to ~frontend \n   - [x] Move/split up [`manage_feature.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/e500edf7284e42be812fd2d8c9735007bce3b4de/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/components/manage_feature.vue) into scanner-specific components (interacts/conflicts with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322902, possibly?)\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\n--\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- start-discoto-summary --\u003e\n## Auto-Summary :robot:\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eDiscoto Usage\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n---\n\n\u003e **Points**\n\u003e\n\u003e Discussion points are declared by headings, list items, and single\n\u003e lines that start with the text (case-insensitive) `point:`.
