Create a endpoint to get the truncated authorized `groups` count given an array of user IDs. Implemented in GraphQL (details below) - `2` ~backend\n\n### GraphQL API\n\n`groupCount` for a set of users can be obtained by accessing the [`users`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/#available-queries) GraphQL endpoint.\n\n**Example request:**\n\n```json\nquery {\n  users(usernames: [\"asubramanian1\", \"mwoolf\"]){\n    nodes{\n      id\n      avatarUrl\n      name\n      groupCount\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"users\": {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/User/1678249\",\n          \"avatarUrl\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon\",\n          \"name\": \"Max Woolf\",\n          \"groupCount\": null\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/User/1675776\",\n          \"avatarUrl\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f2253d38808acfe769a32da952dbe91d?s=80\u0026d=identicon\",\n          \"name\": \"Aishwarya Subramanian\",\n          \"groupCount\": 18\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Access\n\n- Administrator users can access the group count of all users in the system.\n- Non-administrator users can access the group count of only self\n\n### Feature Flag\n\nThe feature is gated behind the flag: `user_group_counts`, and is disabled by default.\n\n### Additional notes\n\nThe additional complexity for **group** count is due to the performance concerns we've dicussed here and discovered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39581#note_399390950, and the implementation is based on ~database and ~frontend maintainer feedback with the intent to get the page time below `100ms` by asynchronously loading the `groups` count.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-15T15:18:31.695Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:21:43.247Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T16:20:45.536Z","closed_by":{"id":4014344,"username":"aishbuilds","name":"Aishwarya

In a first `stage`, have an *upstream job* archiving some artifacts\n2. In a second `stage`, add any of the `dependency_scanning` jobs (s.a. `gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning`) to the pipeline definition\n3. With `needs: [\u003cupstream job\u003e]`:\n   1. Override (or extend) the above job so that it `needs: [\u003cupstream job\u003e]` artifacts\n   2. Run the pipeline\n   3. When run, the `dependency_scanning` job **does not retrieve artifacts** from *upstream job*\n4. With `dependencies: [\u003cupstream job\u003e]`:\n   1. Now, change the above job by replacing `needs:` with `dependencies:`\n   2. Run the pipeline\n   3. When run, the `dependency_scanning` job now **retrieves artifacts** from *upstream job*\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`needs` doesn't work for `dependency_scanning` jobs.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`needs` should work for `dependency_scanning` jobs.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nRemove [`dependencies` from `dependency_scanning`](`https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L24`).\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nNote: see comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249569#note_436961514 We can't quickly address this issue so the first step is to add a note to documentation:\n\n1. Add note to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#limitations that `dependency_scanning` doesn't work with DAG right now.\n1. Add a link to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/257949 to show when I will be fixed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-15T12:13:17.366Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T12:36:37.160Z","closed_at":"2020-12-18T16:32:10.724Z","closed_by":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","docs-only","documentation","group::composition analysis","priority::2","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"}],"author":{"id":2269911,"username":"rdesgroppes","name":"Régis Desgroppes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2269911/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdesgroppes"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249569","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/249569","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/249569/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/249569/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#249569","relative":"#249569","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#249569"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1664,"epic":{"id":10154,"iid":1664,"title":"Dependency Scanning - Viable to Complete","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1664","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 28, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":71190076,"iid":249557,"project_id":278964,"title":"merge_request event field tag name inconsistent with other system hook events","description":"\u003c!--\n\n* Use this issue template for suggesting new docs or updates to existing docs.\n  Note: Doc work as part of feature development is covered in the Feature Request template.\n\n* For issues related to features of the docs.gitlab.com site, see\n     https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/issues/\n\n* For information about documentation content and process, see\n     https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/ --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- Include the following detail as necessary:\n* What product or feature(s) affected?\n* What docs or doc section affected?

We aren't building on-top of CE features. We are back-porting EE to CE features, which complicates things a bit. I also looked at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ee_features.html#recommended-alternative-approach-namedscoped-slots\n\nWas told my PM that Secure  MR widgets will go away soon into it's own tab section. So this will all be throwaway code anyway.\n\nIt seemed like the best approach was to create a new CE only Vuex module that contains a subset of logic of the EE version. Because `import eeCode from 'ee_else_ce/ee_code';` pulls in the EE version and overrides the CE version, we end up with two versions of code.\n\nNormally if we had been building on the CE version, in the EE version we'd merge in the CE code.

[timebox]\n\nSince [sbt 1.3.0](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.3.0) (Sep 4, 2019), [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/) became the default dependency management library, replacing [Apache Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/).\n\n`gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning` happens to use `ivyReport` to gather the project dependencies without considering the underlying dependency management library, which doesn't work with sbt 1.3.0+ unless `Coursier` is explicitly disabled (`ThisBuild / useCoursier := false`).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHave the `gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning` job run on a sbt 1.3.0+ project (not disabling `Coursier`!), for instance with the following `project/build.properties` file:\n```properties\nsbt.version=1.3.13\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\nAny existing project may be quickly given a try by changing its `sbt.version` as described above.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`sbt ivyReport` then `sbt -no-colors show ivyReport` (misleadingly?) report successes, but post-processing their output fails because no report got actually generated:\n```\n[FATA] [gemnasium-maven] [\u003ctimestamp\u003e] ▶ open

instance with one of:\n1. `allDependencies`\n2. `dependencyDot`\n3. `dependencyList`\n4. `dependencyTree`\n5. `dependencyBrowseTree` (:warning: not headless)\n6. `projectDependencies`\n\nIf not, determine whether active dependency manager is `Ivy` or `Coursier`:\n1. `Ivy`: keep using `ivyReport`\n2. `Coursier`: either by means of one of the above dependency manager independent tasks, or by means of the `sbt-coursier` plugin\n\n**EDIT:** For sbt *at least*, the best alternative I'm aware of consists in leveraging the [`sbt-dependency-check` plugin](https://github.com/albuch/sbt-dependency-check) which is based on the quite powerful [OWASP `dependency-check`](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/), which in turn automatically updates itself using [NVD Data

Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222448/designs/z03_sorting-details.png7) and parent Epics for details.\n\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe severity column sorting is part of the scope of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230383. \nThe complete requirements outlined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222448/ support sorting by ALL columns. This issue represents the addition of sorting functionality to columns other than the Severity column \u0026 the Identifier column (which have been split into separate issues). \n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] ~backend Add scopes to sorting (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4f3c356688c04f1456e5beee4dad073023111a25/ee/app/models/vulnerability.rb#L82):\n  - [x] `order_detected_at_asc`/`order_detected_at_desc` (use `created_at` column to sort)\n  - [x] `order_state_asc`/`order_state_desc` (use `state` column to sort, will require special logic to return it in preferred order: `Detected`\u003e`Confirmed`\u003e`Resolved`\u003e`Dismissed`)\n  - [x] `order_title_asc`/`order_title_desc` (use `title` column to sort)\n  - [ ] ~~`order_identifier_asc`/`order_identifier_desc` (will require additional work and query to specify the main identifier to use in sorting, also this is a field from another table that will be joined with `vulnerabilities`),~~\n  - [x] `order_report_type_asc`/`order_report_desc` (use `report_type` column to sort, will require special logic to do it alphabetically)\n- [x] ~backend Extend `Vulnerability.order_by` method to support new order options: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4f3c356688c04f1456e5beee4dad073023111a25/ee/app/models/vulnerability.rb#L134\n- [x] ~backend Extend `Types::VulnerabilitySortEnum` enum to support new order options: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/546da4714a09a35f67b4150d6ecf2e78f3c297c7/ee/app/graphql/types/vulnerability_sort_enum.rb#L8\n- [x] ~frontend add `sortable: this.isSortable` to the fields we'd like to be sortable\n\n## Additional context\n\nThe `app/assets/javascripts/alert_management/components/alert_management_table.vue` file has an example implementation on how to sort a column. Fortunately the `gl-table` has support for sorting so we just need to implement the sorting function.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-14T18:22:02.301Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T05:05:49.192Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T05:05:49.161Z","closed_by":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan

An attribute in `known_events.yml` might do as well, such as `type` or similar - i.e `type: group`.\n\nThe key itself could be renamed, but I'm not sure how easy is to do that...\n\nTo keep in mind about renaming keys in Redis \n\nhttps://redis.io/commands/rename\n\nhttps://redis.io/commands/renamenx\n\n\u003e In Cluster mode, both key and newkey must be in the same hash slot, meaning that in practice only keys that have the same hash tag can be reliably renamed in cluster.\n\ncc @gitlab-org/growth/telemetry/engineers","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-14T05:45:58.508Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T09:15:19.666Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T09:15:19.631Z","closed_by":{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::analytics","group::product intelligence","product_intelligence_stale_issue","section::analytics","workflow::problem validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [-] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n    - !61682\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove tests covering use cases when the feature flag is disabled.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-13T22:45:03.452Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T19:14:48.628Z","closed_at":"2021-09-03T04:57:09.166Z","closed_by":{"id":4846639,"username":"fguibert","name":"Florie

mappings in a mostly compatible way for ES 8. Some small steps will be required to remove the redundant `_type` we are sending though.\n\n1. Upgrade client libraries\n1. Remove this `_type` being sent in bulk requests: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/94ca7fd72f3ed89e85458135bb6f05675b4b7e9b/ee/lib/gitlab/elastic/bulk_indexer.rb#L78\n1.

`package-name/version` or the full recipe: `package-name/version@user/channel`. Based on our interactions with the Conan community, it seems it is much more common for C/C++ developers to use only the package name and version when publishing Conan packages.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe problem is that GitLab only accepts the full recipe. This means that C/C++ developers need to customize their package naming conventions just to use GitLab. For many of our customers, this is a deal-breaker. \n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow developers to publish Conan packages with name/version only, which is the more commonly used convention. This change will only impact those using the project-level endpoint, as the instance-level packages rely on the `user` in `pkg/version@user/channel` to identify the target project\n\n#### Further details\n\nThis has been identified by several customers as a blocker in their organization adopting the GitLab Package Registry. We expect to see a 15% lift in the amount of Conan packages published to the GitLab registry as the result of this change.\n\n## Testing and Availability\n\nWe have end-to-end tests for the Conan package manager. This test should be passing after implementing name/version only (the test currently uses the full recipe with the project-level endpoint). To verify that we run `package-and-qa` on the MRs.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-10T22:37:43.912Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T07:02:14.340Z","closed_at":"2021-11-05T16:49:05.738Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Conan Repository","Deliverable","GitLab Free","Package Repositories","Package:P1","backend","customer","devops::package","direction","feature::addition","group::package registry","package:scaling","quad-planning::complete-action","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":10,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247650","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247650","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247650/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/247650/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#247650","relative":"#247650","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#247650"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6816,"epic":{"id":355865,"iid":6816,"title":"Make the Conan repository  generally available (GA)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6816","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70998253,"iid":247637,"project_id":278964,"title":"Differentiate between automatically collapsed and manually (user) collapsed diff files","description":"In the course of two other issues relating to collapsed files, it became apparent that we need a way to track when the **user** collapses a diff file versus when that file started collapsed (whether for performance reasons, or the content didn't change, etc.).\n\nIn [!41393](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41393#note_407451422), we shouldn't show the big blaring warning if the user has already loaded the full file and manually collapsed it or if the file was fully loaded to begin with and the user collapsed that file during the course of their normal review process.\n\nIn [!40752](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40752#note_406742612), we shouldn't show the big warning at the top of the page (soon to be sticky!) if the user manually collapses a file (in all the same scenarios). In that MR, there's currently a rough check if the user has actively dismissed the alert to keep it from coming back if the user has acknowledged it.\n\nBoth of these cases need a more formalized distinction between files that were collapsed by algorithms and files that were collapsed by the user.\n\n### Rough suggestion\n\n1. Update the current `viewer.collapsed` property to `viewer.automaticallyCollapsed`\n2. Add `viewer.manuallyCollapsed` (and all of the Vuex boilerplate to toggle that value)\n3. Add a getter for an individual file that resolves all of the possible logic values (`automaticallyCollapsed`, `manuallyCollapsed`, etc.) to the correct `isCollapsed` value for the `diff_file` component.\n    - There's more than just collapsed values here. Sometimes, a file isn't expanded if it's \"unreadable text\" or if there's an error. These perhaps shouldn't be included in an `isCollapsed` computation, but they're part of the logic that determines if the body should show. It would be nice to centralize that (ever expanding) logic somehow.\n4. Update the `diff_file` component to toggle `manuallyCollapsed`\n5.
