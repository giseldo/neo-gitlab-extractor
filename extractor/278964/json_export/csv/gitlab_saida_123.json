PS1  is\n       set and $- includes i if bash is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state.\n       ...\n\n       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists.  This may be inhibited by using the --norc option.  The --rcfile file option will force  bash\n       to read and execute commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.\n```\n\nThe code responsible for [creating](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.10.3/orchestrator/analyzer.go#L172) and [starting the container](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.10.3/orchestrator/analyzer.go#L201) is in [orchestrator/analyzer.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.10.3/orchestrator/analyzer.go), in the common library.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a Java or Scala project using Maven, Gradle or Sbt\n- Configure Dependency Scanning, and force `DS_DISABLE_DIND` to false \n- Run a pipeline\n\n### Example Project\n\n- Maven project: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven/-/jobs/628431986\n- Maven multi-modules project: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven-multimodules/-/jobs/628325952\n- Gradle project: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle/-/jobs/630486123\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nJob fails with:\n\n`/analyzer: line 24: switch_to: command not found`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nJob succeeds \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs -

The current sort and filter capabilities may not fulfill the need of easily finding a specific package in a large registry, especially at a group level view.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nEnsure users are able to find a specific package within a vast list easily.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove the tabs in the current UI and create a larger-scale robust filter and search fields. This should enable users to filter by both package format (npm, maven, etc) and the same functionality it currently has with a plane text search.\n\n|Design |\n|---|\n|![Package_Registry_Group_View](/uploads/410454707400ba815753c791415e20bb/Package_Registry_Group_View.png) |","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-08T10:15:13.906Z","updated_at":"2021-02-18T07:08:47.217Z","closed_at":"2021-02-01T08:01:40.291Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","UX","UX FY21-Q4","UX debt","devops::package","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::package registry","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"}],"author":{"id":4265456,"username":"icamacho","name":"Iain Camacho","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4265456/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/icamacho"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227349","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227349","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227349/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227349/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227349","relative":"#227349","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227349"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5152,"epic":{"id":177448,"iid":5152,"title":"Package Registry cleanup policies MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5152","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":54087133,"iid":227326,"project_id":278964,"title":"Frontend: Show dependency path in the dependency list and vulnerabilities","description":"This issue tracks the ~frontend work needed to implement #227620.\n\n### Design\n\nSee Designs tab.

The query is something like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.* \nFROM \n(\n  (\n   SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.* \n   FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \n   WHERE (‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúvisibility_level‚Äù IN (0, 10, 20) OR ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúauthor_id‚Äù = 5249152) AND ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù IS NULL\n  )\n  UNION\n  (\n   SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.* \n   FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúprojects‚Äù ON ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù = ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù ON ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù = ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù \n   WHERE (‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúvisibility_level‚Äù IN (0, 10, 20) OR ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúauthor_id‚Äù = 5249152) \n     AND (projects.visibility_level IN (0,10,20)) \n     AND ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúsnippets_access_level‚Äù IN (20, 30)\n  )\n  UNION\n  (\n   SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.* \n   FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúprojects‚Äù ON ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù = ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù ON ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù = ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù \n   WHERE ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúsnippets_access_level‚Äù IN (20, 30, 10) \n     AND (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù WHERE (project_id = snippets.project_id) AND ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù.‚Äúuser_id‚Äù = 5249152))\n  )\n) snippets \nORDER BY ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúupdated_at‚Äù DESC\nLIMIT 20\n```\n\nWithout the `ORDER BY`, this query execution times is around 2.5-3 seconds ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/Gfbn)). Nevertheless, when we introduce the `ORDER BY` the query execution time is increased a lot (7.363 s | [query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/CTW2)).\n\nWith a small rewrite of the query, we can reduce this time to 2.581 s ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/Ve2D)):\n\n```sql\nSELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.*\nFROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \nWHERE id IN\n(\n  (\n   SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.id\n   FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \n   WHERE (‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúvisibility_level‚Äù IN (0, 10, 20) OR ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúauthor_id‚Äù = 5249152) AND ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù IS NULL\n  )\n  UNION\n  (\n   SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.id\n   FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúprojects‚Äù ON ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù = ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù ON ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù = ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù \n   WHERE (‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúvisibility_level‚Äù IN (0, 10, 20) OR ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúauthor_id‚Äù = 5249152) \n     AND (projects.visibility_level IN (0,10,20)) \n     AND ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúsnippets_access_level‚Äù IN (20, 30)\n  )\n  UNION\n  (\n   SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.id\n   FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúprojects‚Äù ON ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù = ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù \n     INNER JOIN ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù ON ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù = ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù \n   WHERE ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúsnippets_access_level‚Äù IN (20, 30, 10) \n     AND (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù WHERE (project_id = snippets.project_id) AND ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù.‚Äúuser_id‚Äù = 5249152))\n  )\n)  \nORDER BY ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúupdated_at‚Äù DESC\nLIMIT 20\n```\n\nThe change also works for the case when the `ORDER BY` is not set, where we can reduce the execution time to 1.5s ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/5ugu))\n\nWe are also changing another query that is present in the `SnippetFinder` EE extension:\n\n```sql\nexplain SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.*\nFROM (\n        (SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.*\n         FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù\n         WHERE ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúauthor_id‚Äù = 5249152\n           AND ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù IS NULL)\n      UNION\n        (SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.*\n         FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù\n         INNER JOIN ‚Äúprojects‚Äù ON ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù = ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù\n         INNER JOIN ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù ON ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù = ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù\n         WHERE ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúsnippets_access_level‚Äù IN (20,\n                                                              30,\n                                                              10)\n           AND (EXISTS\n                  (SELECT 1\n                   FROM ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù\n                   WHERE (project_id = snippets.project_id)\n                     AND ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù.‚Äúuser_id‚Äù = 5249152)))) snippets\n```\n\nThe execution time is quite fast, around 447ms ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/9fMv)). When we introduce a sorting criteria the execution time is very similar 494ms ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/6ovt)).\n\nIf we apply the same optimization, the query would be something like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.*\nFROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù\nWHERE ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù IN\n    (SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù\n     FROM (\n             (SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù\n              FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù\n              WHERE ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúauthor_id‚Äù = 5249152\n                AND ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù IS NULL)\n           UNION\n             (SELECT ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù\n              FROM ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù\n              INNER JOIN ‚Äúprojects‚Äù ON ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù = ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù\n              INNER JOIN ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù ON ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúproject_id‚Äù = ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.‚Äúid‚Äù\n              WHERE ‚Äúproject_features‚Äù.‚Äúsnippets_access_level‚Äù IN (20,\n                                                                   30,\n                                                                   10)\n                AND (EXISTS\n                       (SELECT 1\n                        FROM ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù\n                        WHERE (project_id = snippets.project_id)\n                          AND ‚Äúproject_authorizations‚Äù.‚Äúuser_id‚Äù = 5249152)))) snippets)\n```\n\nThe execution time now is 48ms ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/k3UV)) and with a sort criteria the time is 46ms ([query plan](https://explain.depesz.com/s/nsh1).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-08T06:38:53.577Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T07:06:15.095Z","closed_at":"2020-07-13T09:33:44.178Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","bug::performance","devops::create","group::editor","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier L√≥pez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227311","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227311","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227311/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227311/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227311","relative":"#227311","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227311"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":54065698,"iid":227290,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display 'Resolved' notification on Security Dashboards (FE implementation issue)","description":"See [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207183) and parent Epic for details.\n\nNOTE: this has been triaged by @svedova as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207183#note_348853725\n\n## Implementation Plan\n(from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207183#implementation-checklist - please update) \n* [ ] ~frontend Display notification when a vulnerability has all findings resolved but is still in a `detected` state.

Perhaps we can just remove that block (create our own layout or use another one) to avoid showing those?\n- :white_check_mark: The notification banners are created using flash messaging\n  - In which case, they can‚Äôt be delayed, they always appear on the next page load, right?\n  - Or do they only disappear after we successfully access them from that same flash hash?\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Research the notification banners (see questions \u0026 assumptions above)\n1. Research the footer links (just to make sure my assumption isn‚Äôt way off base)\n1. Consider, briefly, creating some mechanism for delaying flash messages (if it doesn‚Äôt already exist ‚Äì look for existing gems, too)\n1. Update the layout (duplicate \u0026 modify, find a new one, or potentially modify this one directly) to not show flash messages and to not show the footer links\n1. Submit 1 MR for hiding the footer links, 1 MR for hiding the flash messages, (any other MRs for delaying flash messages until later)\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-07T20:01:51.510Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T18:47:15.665Z","closed_at":"2020-08-20T16:25:28.633Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"labels":["Engineering","devops::growth","group::acquisition","milestone::p2","section::growth","severity::4","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"}],"author":{"id":4413992,"username":"s_awezec","name":"Sam Awezec","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4413992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/s_awezec"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas Reedy","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5755274/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dreedy"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227276","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227276","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227276/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227276/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227276","relative":"#227276","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227276"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3967,"epic":{"id":83545,"iid":3967,"title":"New user onboarding relaunch","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3967","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":54061000,"iid":227274,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create an event that fires during the group creation process","description":"## Problem\n \nIf a user enters a common name for their group they get a message that the URL is already taken which reduces the likelihood that they will be able to successfully sign up for GitLab. \n \n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-07_at_3.29.30_PM](/uploads/a948e7abde2929151ec260caeb21ad97/Screen_Shot_2020-07-07_at_3.29.30_PM.png)\n \n## Solution\n \nMVC update to resolve this issue: \n \n* three tracked events:\n   * successful submission (on first try)\n   * error: URL path is already taken (each time they attempt to submit the form and it errors)\n   * successful submission (after getting an error re: path already taken)\n\nIf a user encounters the error multiple times then we want to capture that i.e. events would be captured in the following scenario: \n1.

this failure, then yes, as @.luke mentions, we\nwill need to document the limitation.\n\nIf we want to actually make this unsubscribable, then probably also yes, or at\nleast to link existing documentation to design management index.\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**\n\nOption 1: Removing unsubscribe interface\n\n- Feature: test that unsubscribe is not presented to user\n- Unit (Views): test that unsubscribe interface is not generated\n\nOption 2: enable subscribe/unsubscribe functionality (see #228755)\n\n- Unit: Test for `Subscribable` methods\n- Integration: Test for `SentNotification` compatibility\n- Feature: Test subscribing and unsubscribing to design\n\n**Security Tests Planned:** \n\nOption 1: Removing unsubscribe interface\n\nNone\n\nOption 2: enable subscribe/unsubscribe

We already document the kinds of files we support.\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**\n\n~GraphQL request tests for handling illegal file-types.\n\nAdd tests in the `NewVersionWorker` for similar scenarios.\n\n**Security Tests Planned:**\n\nThis test is essentially entirely about security.\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**\n\nEither we just add tests for this scenario and encode the current behavior as\ndefined behavior, or we aim to capture this error and report to the user.\n\nCurrently this does not cause errors during version creation, where we should\ncatch it, but during image processing in the `NewVersionWorker`. If we capture\nthis state in version creation, then we can avoid needed changes to\n`NewVersionWorker`, but if the range of types is not co-incident, then we may\nneed changes to both.\n\nThis is somewhat odd, since we currently _do_ check the mimetype of the file\nduring the `NewVersionWorker` before processing (see\n`design_management/generate_image_versions_service.rb#L49` in\n`#generate_image`), so this is either a case of a mismatch between the values of\n`DesignManagement::DesignV432x230Uploader::MIME_TYPE_WHITELIST` and the logic of\n`#content_type_whitelist.rb#L34` in `check_content_type_whitelist!` or something\nsubtler, such as the content not matching the declared mimetype.\n\nSince this is a very low incidence event, and encountered during offline\nprocessing, tolerating some level of failure is likely acceptable.\n\n**MR Breakdown:**\n\nA single MR, if needed.\n\n**Weight Estimate:**\n\n2 to eliminate the error, otherwise 1 to tolerate it (possibly with test).\n\n---\n\n## Backlog Refinement by @.Luke:\n\n**Documentation needed:**  N\n\n**Test Activity Planned:** Change the test of `GenerateImageVersionsService` to test for logging\n\n**Security Tests Planned:** N\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**  Switch to logging the error https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227175#note_381333333\n\n**MR Breakdown:** 1 MR\n\n**Weight Estimate:** 1\n\n---\n## Backlog Refinement by @toupeira:\n\n**Documentation needed:**  N\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**  Test the worker with an invalid file.\n\n**Security Tests Planned:**  n/a\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**  This is an expected error, so I think we just need to catch it to avoid the worker retrying multiple times.\n\n**MR Breakdown:** 1 MR\n\n**Weight Estimate:**  1\n\n---","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-07T13:45:08.548Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:57:44.068Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T10:52:10.854Z","closed_by":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","backend","devops::plan","good for new contributors","group::product planning","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"}],"author":{"id":402401,"username":"jobbot","name":"Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aaa6738f1ebf25404010884af511b0e7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jobbot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227175","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227175","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227175/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227175/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227175","relative":"#227175","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227175"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":54030969,"iid":227161,"project_id":278964,"title":"Comment on an MR commit or version comparison is not visible in diff after publishing","description":"The following discussion from !33655 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @pedroms started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33655#note_372536285):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e @jboyson üêõ **Bug**: When comparing MR **versions**, after submitting a single or multi-line comment on added lines, the comment is not visible in the Changes tab.

the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen using a non-commit SHA as ref the pipeline does not run\n\n```plaintext\n'release ref must be a valid ref'\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe pipeline should run if the ref is a commit SHA, a tag or a branch name\n\n### Relevant logs and/or

concisely)\nSome identifiers can be very long, and in the Pipeline Security tab, they're not wrapped correctly, leading to text overlapping.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)\n- Run dependency scanning on a vulnerable project\n- Make sure you have dependencies caught by the Gemnasium analyzer\n- Go to the pipeline once run, and click the Security tab.\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n-

behavior?\n\n- Text overlaps (see screenshot below)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n- Text wrapped correctly.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-06_at_10.46.12](/uploads/f9a0c6e04df7be957a16d3c35796f2eb/Screen_Shot_2020-07-06_at_10.46.12.png)\n\n(test project, no confidential data here)\n\n### Output of

(%)","description":"\u003c!--¬†The¬†first¬†four¬†sections:¬†\"Problem¬†to¬†solve\",¬†\"Intended¬†users\", \"User experience goal\",¬†and¬†\"Proposal\",¬†are¬†strongly¬†recommended,¬†while¬†the¬†rest¬†of¬†the¬†sections¬†can¬†be¬†filled¬†out¬†during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution.¬†--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try¬†to¬†define¬†the¬†who/what/why¬†of¬†the¬†opportunity¬†as¬†a¬†user¬†story.¬†For¬†example,¬†\"As¬†a¬†(who),¬†I¬†want¬†(what),¬†so¬†I¬†can¬†(why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nCurrently in the performance report my project have quite a few benchmarks. However to at a glace determine if there is any relevant degradation is hard. In golang benchmarks output is on the form ns/op, so we end up with \n\n`ns/op: 2147483647 (+1759776281) in Benchmark1`\n\nDetermining how bad this is requires manually counting digits and its one among many benchmarks. \n\nBut even smaller more easy to read benchmarks require some effort. The below numbers are a 2% degradation which is probably within the margin of error but still requires thought to figure out. \n\n`ns/op: 256 (+5) in Benchmark1`\n\n### Intended users\n\nAnyone for whom performance is important will benefit from increased performance tracking directly or indirectly\n\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n\n### User experience goal\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Show performance changes in the performance report as a % as well as the regular numbers.\n    * So `ns/op: 2147483647 (+1759776281) in Benchmark1` would become something like `ns/op: 2147483647 (+1759776281) (+453%) in Benchmark1`\n    * Where the % is (new score/base score -1)*100.\n    * This makes the (very severe) degradation immediately visible.\n\n### Technical Proposal\n\nThe browser performance and load performance widgets both use `performance_issue_body.vue` as the component to render issues, so changes we make to that file should be reflected in both widgets. We could duplicate the `issueDelta`/`formatScore` pattern that we already use to display the delta as a number, call the new version `issueDeltaPercentage`/`formatPercentage`, and use it to calculate and display the delta as a percentage of the base score.\n\nWe can use one of [these formatters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/lib/utils/unit_format/index.js#L135-155) to do the locale-specific percentage formatting (i.e. `1,234.56%` vs `1 234,56%`) for the string that goes in the widget.\n\n### Further details\n\nFuture iterations: \n* For known sitespeed (for browser performance) or K6 (for load testing) metrics we can be specific with \"good\"/\"bad\" delineation about what the change means.\n* It might also be nice to be able to define performance degradations as a % but beyond the scope of this proposal\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo impact\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nMinor\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

It's possible to write validation tools that catch this in the CI pipeline but using a JSON schema file, can be helpful for offering documentation and hints.\n\n## Further details\n\nThis is a  problem for the `www-gitlab-com` where we need to write release post items every month.\n\n## Proposal\n\nUsers should be able to define custom schema files that are loaded in the Web IDE.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nThe Web IDE has an existing file that's loaded for settings used by the Web Terminal [`.gitlab/.gitlab-webide.yml`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/#file-syncing-to-web-terminal). This should be extended with an additional section `schemas` that allows users to define additional schemas.\n\n```yaml\nschemas:\n  - uri: https://json.schemastore.org/package\n    match: \n      - package.json\n  - uri: https://absolute/raw/url\n    match: \n      - data/release_posts/unreleased/*.yml\n      - data/release_posts/unreleased/*.yaml\n  - uri: https://absolute/raw/url2\n    match: \n      - data/release_posts/unreleased/*.{yml,yaml}\n  - uri: https://absolute/second/raw/url\n    match: \n      - \"*.gitlab-ci.yml\"\n```\n\nAs an MVC we will only load schema files referenced by absolute URL and not relative path in the repository. This could be the RAW url to a file in the project, a snippet, or something else.\n\n### Pricing Tier\n\nThis feature is going to be part of ~\"GitLab Premium\" in the ~\"Enterprise Edition\". The rationale for this decision is that teams collaborating on projects where custom schema may be required would benefit from having feedback and mechanisms to use this in the Web IDE.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-06T04:30:07.717Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T12:02:17.368Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T08:57:03.029Z","closed_by":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu
