Based on my initial analysis it looks like [the costs of the `rspec as-if-foss` jobs](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/590833/WIP:-Kyle-Wiebers-Scratchpad?widget=8344131\u0026udv=0) for March were $18,525.30.

This includes support for a set of [package managers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/) so all your packages can stay in one place. \n\nPrior to making those features available to the community for free, we need to better the implications of making this change and come up with a plan to do it. The outcome of the investigation will be a set of weighted and scheduled issues in the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2867.\n\n### Tasks to  Evaluate\n\n- [ ] Determine feasibility of moving the Package Registry from ~\"GitLab Premium\" to ~\"GitLab Core\" \n- [ ] Create issue(s) for implementation and add them to the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2867\n- [ ] Set weight on implementation issue(s)\n- [ ] If weight is greater than 5, break issue into smaller issues\n\n### Risks and Implementation Considerations \n\n\n## Breakdown of the files to be moved\n\n**Note** This list does not include the spec files. For each file listed here, there is likely a matching spec file that will also need to be moved.\n\nThis list is not yet complete and is still in progress.\n\nThe package stage consists of three main components: The APIs that package manager clients interact with to push/pull and work with packages, the GitLab frontend views that display package information, the GitLab backend that supports those frontend views.\n\nThis migration will involve moving all of those components and their associated tests from `ee` locations to non-ee locations in addition to removing the [license restriction](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e431ed9d64ef1111712f0770916dc3f0f9cccffc/ee/app/models/license.rb#L91) and related code.\n\nTo begin, I believe we should move the front end code and all of it's supporting backend code first. This will allow packages to display on the front end for core, and as we move each package manager, we shouldn't need to further change the front end\n\nThese MRs will all be very large, but as long as they are limited to only file movement, the reviews should be straightforward and move quickly.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges will be dealing with the shared backend code.\n\n### Client

Context \n\nThe Development and Quality groups use Sisense charts embedded in Handbook pages ([example](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/)) to monitor department performance indicators. Both groups have expressed willingness to dogfood Analytics for specific KPIs if we can produce appropriate computations. \n\n### Problem to Solve\n\nThis issue extends [Report Pages](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3214) by allowing a user to embedded a chart. A user with appropriate permissions can choose to make a specific chart publicly viewable and obtain a link or other instructions for embedding into a handbook page much as Sisense does. \n\n### Proposal\n\n1. A button with pop-up copies iframe code to the clipboard which can be pasted into an html page. See this \u003ca href=\"#note_361159611\"\u003edesign note\u003c/a\u003e.\n1. This MVC works only for public projects. A follow-on issue will address on granting permissions to private projects.\n1. This embedded chart is not a snapshot of the data, but a live run of the repot.\n1. A \u003ca href=\"#note_361451148\"\u003eseparate page\u003c/a\u003e will render a layout specifically for embeds but no changes to REST API are expected.\n1. Hide the feature behind a feature flag. Use gitlab-org group for beta test.\n1. Consider future adaptation of this feature for Generic Reports Page while developing.\n\n### Visual\n\nSee this \u003ca href=\"#note_361159611\"\u003edesign note\u003c/a\u003e.\n\n\n### Examples from our Handbook\n\nSome example pages are [Engineering KPI Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators) or [Quality KPI Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/).\n\nSee the [erb template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/source/includes/_performance_indicator.erb#L27) that renders these charts in the handbook. The erb file is consuming this [data file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/performance_indicators.yml). See also more details about [how the page works](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#how-to-work-with-pages-like-this).\n\nIt appears to be doing

This issue is just the ~frontend portion.\n\n### Approach\n\nShould be a easy win. All we need to do is ee/app/assets/javascripts/license_compliance/store/modules/list/actions.js\n\nFrom:\n```\n      params: {\n        per_page: 10,\n        page: state.pageInfo.page || 1,\n        ...params,\n      },\n```\n\n\nTo:\n\n```\n      params: {\n        per_page: 10,\n        page: state.pageInfo.page || 1,\n        sort_by: 'denied'\n        ...params,\n      },\n```\n\n** We should create a constant for 'denied' to live in ee/app/assets/javascripts/license_compliance/store/modules/list/constants.js\n\nIt would be a bit odd of a pattern for this vuex module to reference a constant outside of it's module.\n\nWe already have ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/constants.js\n\n```\nexport const LICENSE_APPROVAL_CLASSIFICATION = {\n  ALLOWED: 'allowed',\n  DENIED: 'denied',\n};\n```\n\nNot sure of the correct pattern here. Maybe abstract the mutual constant into another constant file? \n\n## Clarification on why we need sort\n\nWe paginate the license results. 10 results per page.\n\nSorting by classification `denied` first (`policy violation: denied` label) first is needed because if a license with a policy violation happens to be on a page \u003e 1, then it will be confusing for the use to see the \"policy violation\" alert banner, but no policy violations visible on the first page of results (this is the default set of data that is loaded).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-08T20:03:43.521Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T10:35:19.263Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T00:50:02.580Z","closed_by":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Secure UX::Compliance \u0026 Auditing","UX","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","quad-planning::complete-no-action","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"}],"author":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213908","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213908","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213908/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213908/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213908","relative":"#213908","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213908"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33065915,"iid":213905,"project_id":278964,"title":"[FE] Visually depict Value Stream Analytics stages as a flow","description":"### Description\n\n\u003e As we start to realign value stream analytics as a flow, we should arrange our stages to visually depict a value chain.

Implement backfill of PackageFiles/Blobs","description":"This should require very little PackageFile-specific code, since replication of new PackageFiles with events should already be implemented.\n\nThe true goal is implementation of Self-Service Framework and its documentation.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- [ ] ~~`RegistryConsistencyWorker` creates missing `PackageFileRegistry` records (this worker already exists, just add `PackageFileRegistry` to its list, for now)~~ =\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217863\n- [x] Another worker (e.g. `RegistrySyncWorker`, I can't think of a reason why it would be Blob-specific) enqueues sync jobs for registries needing sync\n  - This is currently handled by e.g. `FileDownloadDispatchWorker`, and we should copy as much as we need, but I strongly recommend not reusing it as-is.\n  - This is our best opportunity to change that logic without risk.\n    - Use a worker that doesn't run long, e.g. `Reenqueuer`\n    - We now have a Replicator \"interface\".\n    - Sync concurrency settings should apply across event-triggered syncs as well, not just backfill ones, so it should not be managed solely within this worker. Instead, concurrency limits should be handled further down, in the worker doing syncing. So, for this issue we can ignore concurrency limits. Later, we can stop enqueuing jobs from this worker if we are already at the concurrency limit.\n  - Optionally, make it sync only \"unsynced\" in 1 MR, then also \"failed\" and \"missing on primary\" in another MR.\n- [x] We can reuse `Geo::EventWorker` as sync jobs, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.9.2-ee/ee/lib/gitlab/geo/log_cursor/events/event.rb#L11: `::Geo::EventWorker.perform_async(event.replicable_name, event.event_name, event.payload)`. E.g. `::Geo::EventWorker.perform_async(\"package_file\", \"created\", { \"model_record_id\" =\u003e 4 })`\n- [ ] Anything that needs to be done in order to add a new blob must be added to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html#blob-replicator-strategy. After following the doc, there should be sufficient specs in place that guarantee Geo support of the new blob.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-08T16:53:54.451Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T09:20:27.996Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T06:59:38.446Z","closed_by":{"id":3944199,"username":"fzimmer","name":"Fabian Zimmer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3944199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fzimmer"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","Deliverable","devops::systems","feature flag","group::geo","missed-deliverable","missed:13.0","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213872","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":2},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213872","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213872/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213872/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213872","relative":"#213872","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213872"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2346,"epic":{"id":16453,"iid":2346,"title":"Geo: Self Service Framework - First Implementation for Package File replication","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2346","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33053997,"iid":213862,"project_id":278964,"title":"Delete Releases in UI of \"Edit Release\" page","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nToday, users are able to delete a release via the [Release API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/index.html#delete-a-release). In order to support all the capabilities in the UI, we need to enable users to delete the Release.\n\n#### User story\n\nAs a user, I want to be able to delete a release using the UI, so that I can easily manage my release entries without having to switch context between UI and API.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n#### Use cases\n\n* A user adds release notes to a tag, but realizes this is not the right tag and wants to easily remove the release \n* A user wants to delete a historical release on the release page for hygiene, but still wants to be able to pull historical releases via API.\n\n### Proposal\n\n[🌈 SEE PROTOTYPES IN THE `DESIGN` TAB](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213862/designs/release__edit.png)\n\n#### Acceptance criteria\n\n* Users should be able to delete a release through the UI.\n* In the `edit` view of a release entry, a button to delete the release should be added to the bottom of the page.\n  * Permission: Only **Mantainers** should see the button. For all other roles, it should not be rendered in the UI.\n  * ~frontend: Use [gitlab-ui button, type danger](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/iframe.html?id=base-button--default\u0026knob-category=tertiary\u0026knob-variant=danger\u0026knob-size=medium)\n  * Button label should read: `Delete release`\n* Clicking the `Delete release` button in the `edit release` form should trigger confirmation a modal. The copy should read:\n  * ~frontend: Use [gitlab-ui modal component](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-modal--default).\n    * Modal title: `Delete release`\n    * Modal body: `You are about to delete \u003crelease_name\u003e. The related Git tag remains, and the assets from this release can still be found in the \u003ctag_page\u003e. Read more about \u003cdeleting a release\u003e. Are you sure you want to continue?`\n      * the `\u003ctag_page\u003e` should link to the detail view of the tag associated to the release. `\u003cdeleting a release\u003e` should link to the documentation anchor for release deletion.\n    * Buttons: `Cancel` and `Delete`\n  * Clicking `Cancel` closes the modal. No action is performed.\n  * Clicking `Delete release` closes the modal and triggers an action to delete the release entry. \n* If the user confirms the deletion of a release in the modal, the browser should redirect the user to the `Releases` overview page.\n* **Deleting a release should `NOT` delete the Git tag and evidence collection.**\n* In the `Releases` overview page, the deleted release entry should be removed from the UI.\n* A toast component should be displayed in the UI, with a confirmation message.\n  * ~frontend: Use [gitlab-ui toast component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toast).\n  * **Please note: the prototype displays an alert, but the implementation should use a Toast component.**\n  * The toast should be dismissible (display the _close_ button).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n* Only Developers and above should be able to delete Releases.\n* If a user does not have access to delete a Release, they should not see the delete button in the UI.\n\n#### Out of scope\n\n* We can also consider in a future iteration restoration of deleted Releases.\n* For this iteration, we won't consider going through an approval process for deleting a Release. Later on, deleting a release would kick off a merge request for the Project Owner/Maintainer to Approve prior to approval   \n\n### Documentation\n\nYes, this feature requires a new documentation on the Releases Docs Page. ~\"Technical Writing\" \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* When a release is deleted a tag should not be deleted \n* The Release and Release View Page should be removed when someone deletes the release from the UI (and API for that matter) \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nUsers will be able to delete releases through the UI.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

This order has an impact when [merging the reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.9.0/orchestrator/orchestrator.go#L174) using [issue.MergeReports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.9.0/issue/report.go#L105), which in turn delegates to [issue.Dedupe](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/blob/v2.9.0/issue/dedupe.go#L23).\nIn the non-DinD setup, the order in which DS reports are processed is not deterministic,\nso the Rails backend might generate a different result when [removing the duplicates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.9.2-ee/ee/app/services/security/merge_reports_service.rb#L108), even though the logic is the same. The deduplication logic was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commit/887812d6788ee015075c34823fc7761ecffcae18\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a project where Docker-in-Docker Dependency Scanning is enabled in the `master` branch, and create a MR that switches to non-DinD Dependency Scanning.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/merge_requests/80\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe Security Scanning widget lists new vulnerabilities and fixed vulnerabilities.\n\n```\nSecurity scanning detected 11 new, and 9 fixed vulnerabilities\n```\n\nNew vulnerabilities:\n\n```\nUnknown Untrusted Search Path in ffi\nUnknown Improper Input Validation in nokogiri\nUnknown Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion) in nokogiri\nUnknown Improper Input Validation in nokogiri\nUnknown Use After Free in nokogiri\nUnknown Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in puma\nUnknown Cross-site Scripting in rack\nUnknown Information Exposure in rack\nUnknown Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in rack\nUnknown Cross-site Scripting in sinatra\nUnknown Path Traversal in sinatra\n```\n\nFixed vulnerabilities:\n\n```\nHigh ruby-ffi DDL loading issue on Windows OS\nMedium sinatra ruby gem path traversal via backslash characters on Windows\nUnknown Nokogiri gem, via libxml, is affected by DoS and RCE vulnerabilities\nUnknown Nokogiri gem, via libxml2, is affected by multiple vulnerabilities\nUnknown Revert libxml2 behavior in Nokogiri gem that could cause XSS\nUnknown Nokogiri gem, via libxslt, is affected by multiple vulnerabilities\nUnknown Possible DoS vulnerability in Rack\nUnknown Possible XSS vulnerability in Rack\nUnknown XSS via the 400 Bad Request page\n```\n\n![Capture_d_écran_2020-04-08_16.57.42](/uploads/a15b1659967279f812cca42db1bd7d20/Capture_d_écran_2020-04-08_16.57.42.png)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe Security Scanning widget lists no vulnerabilities because the MR introduces no new vulnerabilities, and fixes no existing ones.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nA quick hack would be to update the [`MergeReportsService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.9.2-ee/ee/app/services/security/merge_reports_service.rb#L4) to sort the vulnerability findings/occurrences prior to removing the duplicates, using the current value of `DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` as a source of truth. See [Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L10\n):\n\n```yaml\n  DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS: \"bundler-audit, retire.js, gemnasium, gemnasium-maven, gemnasium-python\"\n```\n\nWe could do the same for SAST.\n\nUltimately we should improve the deduplicate logic so that [`MergeReportsService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.9.2-ee/ee/app/services/security/merge_reports_service.rb#L4) does not depend on a hard-coded list.\n\nIdeally, the Rails backend would store all the vulnerability findings, and deduplicate them when rending the list for the UI.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nHard code priority to scanners and sort them something like following \n\n```ruby \n  def sort_by_ds_analyzers\n      analyzer_priorities = {\n        \"bundler_audit\" =\u003e 1,\n        \"retire.js\" =\u003e  2,\n        \"gemnasium\" =\u003e 3,\n        \"gemnasium-maven\" =\u003e 3,\n        \"gemnasium-python\" =\u003e 3\n      }.freeze\n\n      @source_reports.sort! do |a, b|\n        a_scanner_id, b_scanner_id = a.scanners.values[0].external_id, b.scanners.values[0].external_id\n\n        analyzer_priorities[a_scanner_id] \u003c=\u003e analyzer_priorities[b_scanner_id]\n      end\n    end\n\n```\nOrchestrator layer was deduping reports in certain order. In that way we can imitate behaviour of orchestrator layer and have same output when switching no-dind. \n\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nSET should add an end to end test to support non-DinD branches.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-08T14:46:03.594Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T10:49:54.292Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T08:50:54.802Z","closed_by":{"id":3696420,"username":"caneldem","name":"Can

echo \"UI_DEFINED_VARIABLE is ${UI_DEFINED_VARIABLE}\"\n\ntrigger-child:\n  trigger:\n    include: child-ci.yml\n    strategy: depend\n```\n\nchild-ci.yml\n```yaml\nchild:\n  script:\n    - echo \"UI_DEFINED_VARIABLE is ${UI_DEFINED_VARIABLE}\"\n```\n\nI think this makes sense because the intent of parent/child pipeline ([per documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html)) is to enhance readability of one large pipeline, not to divide them in small independent ones.\n\n### Intended users\n\nAnyone using manual trigger to test their pipeline with specific configuration.\n\nAs an example, when creating a rule for a specific branch, I always create a corresponding test rule with a variable so that I can emulate the behavior on a different branch (e.g. for debugging purpose).\n\n### Note\n\nThis probably apply to API triggered pipelines.\n\n@thaoyeager I think this should be placed in the [parent/child epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2750)\n\n### Workaround\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/multi_project_pipelines.html#passing-variables-to-a-downstream-pipeline\n\n```yaml\ntrigger-child:\n  trigger:\n    include: child-ci.yml\n  variables:\n    UI_DEFINED_VARIABLE: $UI_DEFINED_VARIABLE\n```\n\n\nin case you would like to transmit a non-existent variables to be evaluated literally in the child if they don't exist on the parent.\n\nThe workaround above will not work if the variable to be propagated is not defined in the parent (e.g. only provided when triggering the pipeline manually).\n\nIn that case the parent should specify the variable top-level:\n\nParent `.gitlab-ci.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nimage: alpine\n\nvariables:\n  VAR_TO_PROPAGATE: \"\"\nchild:\n  trigger:\n    include: child.yml\n  variables:\n    VAR_IN_CHILD: $VAR_TO_PROPAGATE\n```\n\nChild `child.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nif-var:\n  script: echo $VAR_IN_CHILD\n  rules:\n    - if: $VAR_IN_CHILD != \"\"\n\nif-not-var:\n  script: echo\n  rules:\n    - if: $VAR_IN_CHILD == \"\"\n```\n\nThis runs the job `if-not-var` by default and when I define `VAR_TO_PROPAGATE` when running the pipeline manually, it [runs the job ](https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino/test/-/pipelines/240394178)`if-var`\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a `forward` keyword nested under `trigger` with 2 nested value\n- `yaml_variables: true` - will represent the current/default behavior\n- `pipeline_variables: true` - with this, pipeline UI variables are passed\n\n\n```yaml\nvariables:\n  BAR: bar\n\ntrigger-downstream:\n  variables:\n    FOO: foo\n  trigger:\n    include: child.yml\n    forward: # I nested this keyword under trigger\n      yaml_variables: true # this is the current/default behavior\n      pipeline_variables: true # with this, pipeline UI variables are passed\n```\n\n```yaml\ntrigger-downstream:\n  trigger:\n    project: namespace/project-2\n    forward: # I nested this keyword under trigger\n      yaml_variables: true # this is the current/default behavior\n      pipeline_variables: true # with this, pipeline UI variables are passed\n```\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-07T19:45:52.910Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T18:52:49.521Z","closed_at":"2022-03-30T08:47:22.744Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","FY23::Q1","backend","backend-weight::3","bridge pipelines","candidate::14.9","customer","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","missed:14.9","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":5220898,"username":"adrienbernede","name":"Adrien Bernede","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5220898/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adrienbernede"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":147,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":61,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213729","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213729","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213729/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213729/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213815"},"references":{"short":"#213729","relative":"#213729","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213729"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4529,"epic":{"id":120136,"iid":4529,"title":"Passing variables to downstream pipelines","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4529","group_id":9970},"iteration":{"id":44760,"iid":55,"sequence":12,"group_id":9970,"title":"Pipeline Authoring: March 21, 2022 -

This issue proposes investigating the possibility and scope of adding limits to the GitLab Package Registry. \r\n\r\nThis investigation is part of the broader epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1422, which aims to add limits for the Package stage.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n### _What limits are currently in place for the GitLab Package Registry. [(This includes all package manager formats)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/)_\r\n\r\n#### File Size\r\n\r\n| Package Type | Max Size |\r\n|--------------|----------|\r\n| NPM | None |\r\n| Maven | None |\r\n| Conan | 50 MB |\r\n| NuGet | 50 MB |\r\n| PyPI | 50 MB |\r\n\r\nFor Conan/NuGet/PyPI, these are controlled [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6d9b901d74c190c0e92b2dde7b96e79acc49e536/ee/lib/api/helpers/packages_helpers.rb#L6) and can be modified per package type in the `authorize_workhorse!` call (hardcoded).\r\n\r\nMaven could easily be modified by adjusting it to use `authorize_workhorse!`, or by passing it in as a param in it's file upload endpoint (hardcoded).\r\n\r\nNPM is the only package manager *[not](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6d9b901d74c190c0e92b2dde7b96e79acc49e536/ee/app/services/packages/npm/create_package_service.rb)*[ using workhorse uploads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6d9b901d74c190c0e92b2dde7b96e79acc49e536/ee/app/services/packages/npm/create_package_service.rb) (it uses carrierwave and accepts the file directly), there is no current limit.\r\n\r\n#### Current File Name and Type exclusion\r\n\r\n| Package Type | File exclusions |\r\n|--------------|-----------------|\r\n| NPM | None. I believe we can restrict to only `.tgz` files. File names are validated with the standard package name regex. |\r\n| Maven | None. We should be able to restrict to `.xml, .pom, .jar` files. File names are validated with a Maven specific regex. |\r\n| Conan | Yes. Only specific file names and types are [allowed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/regex.rb#L9) defined in [`ConanFileMetadatum`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/models/packages/conan_file_metadatum.rb#L20). This has proven to be an issue because some files that should be allowed were not known during implementation, preventing some use cases. There is a list of files in the conan source code [here](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/blob/develop/conans/paths/__init__.py#L25), but it is unclear which are the allowed upload files and which are other files, so some investigation will be needed to update. |\r\n| NuGet | Yes. Only `.nupkg` files are allowed. File names are validated with the standard package name regex |\r\n| PyPI | None. We should be able to restrict to `tar.gz` and `.whl` files. File names are validated with the standard package name regex |\r\n\r\n#### Current registry storage limits\r\n\r\nThere is currently no limit (that I can tell) to the amount of storage that can be used for files in the package registry at the project, group, or instance levels.- Are there sensible, non-controversial limits that can be easily added\r\n\r\n### _Are there specific file types that we should exclude?_\r\n\r\nYes, for each package manager, we should only allow the specific filetypes that package manager uses. \r\n\r\n### _Can we consider adding storage limits in the future? Can they be enforced?_\r\n\r\nWe can add limits likely at the project, group, or instance level. We can limit the total size, or total number of packages. \r\n\r\n#### Total number\r\n\r\nThis would be the easiest route, we could add settings at any of the above levels that could be configured by admin users. Enforcing would be as easy as checking how many packages exist within a given project/group/instance when someone tries to push a new package and rejecting if the limit has been met. Each level would be it's own issue here, each likely having a weight of 3, needing both frontend and backend work.\r\n\r\n#### Total size\r\n\r\nSimilar to number, we could add settings at the above levels for admin users to configure. Enforcing this is a bit more difficult. I'm not sure how we could quickly go about calculating the amount of space taken up by packages. I'm thinking perhaps it could be saved in the database (in a project or group supplemental statistics table) and updated anytime someone pushes or deletes a package. Doable, but likely a larger issue. Each level would be it's own issue here, they would all be somewhat large, \u003e5, and need to be broken down into a few steps to be implemented.\r\n\r\n### _How could we implement the above?_\r\n\r\nSee the proposed issues and the storage limits comments.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Issues \r\n\r\nI've added a rough weight estimate to each\r\n\r\n- `1` Restrict NPM packages to `.tgz` file type\r\n- `1` Restrict Maven packages to `.xml`, `.pom`. and `.jar` files. \r\n- `1` Restrict PyPI packages to `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files.\r\n- `2` Consider tighter naming restrictions for Maven, NPM, NuGet, and PyPI based on any restriction within their own package manager rules\r\n- `1` Limit Maven package files to 50MB\r\n- `2` Limit NPM package files to 50MB\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Create issue for implementation or update existing implementation issue description with implementation proposal \r\n- [x] Set weight on implementation issue\r\n- [x] If weight is greater than 5, break issue into smaller issues\r\n\r\n## Risks and Implementation Considerations\r\n\r\nSetting a limit, specifically on size is a large undertaking. With the proposed idea of storing a constantly updating value in the database, the work might look like:\r\n\r\nFor Project level:\r\n\r\n1.  `1` Database migration to add storage columns to a project_statistics table\r\n2.  `2-3` Background migration to determine storage for existing projects and update the table.\r\n3.  `1-2`(x5) Update package manager code to update the stats every time a package is uploaded/deleted.\r\n4.  `1` Database migration to add limit settings to project table.\r\n5.  `1` Frontend migration for limit settings\r\n6.  `1` Frontend migration for displaying current storage usage or amount remaining\r\n7.  `2` Add logic to reject package uploads when a package is uploaded after the limit is met.\r\n\r\nThe breakdown would be similar for group or instance level. \r\n\r\n# Resulting Issues:\r\n\r\n### Size limits\r\n\r\n- [Maven file size limit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218014)\r\n- [Conan file size limit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218016)\r\n- [NPM file size limit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218018)\r\n- [PyPI file size limit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218015)\r\n- [NuGet file size limit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218017)\r\n\r\n**Note** I've set these up to have Maven implemented first, adding the database migration, so it has a weight of 2 and the others all have a weight of 1. Any can be worked on first and have the weight and ~database MR swapped with Maven.\r\n\r\n### File type restriction\r\n\r\n- [Maven file type restriction](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218020)\r\n- [NPM file type restriction](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218019)\r\n- [PyPI file type restriction](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218022)\r\n\r\n### File name restriction\r\n\r\n- [Package name validation improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218023)\r\n\r\n### Storage limits\r\n\r\n- [Add storage limits to the registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218024)\r\n\r\n**Note** the storage limits issue is large and should be broken down to fit pieces within a given milestone.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-07T18:21:19.019Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T21:55:45.718Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T20:27:22.369Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","ruby","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213724","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213724","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213724/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213724/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213724","relative":"#213724","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213724"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5244,"epic":{"id":184949,"iid":5244,"title":"Package: Application limits","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5244","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33007307,"iid":213723,"project_id":278964,"title":"Installing NPM package from different namespace with CI_JOB_TOKEN fails with 404","description":"### Summary\n\nIf you pull/install an NPM package from a public project with the `CI_JOB_TOKEN`, then it will fail with `404`.\nWithout that token, it will succeed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`user2` tries to download/install the `@root/somepackage`, which is a public project.\n\n\n```\n# this line would suffice, since the project is public\n@root:registry=https://\u003cgitlab-url\u003e/api/v4/packages/npm/\n\n# but, by adding the following line, you'll a 404 error when you try to install\n//\u003cgitlab-url\u003e/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=${CI_JOB_TOKEN}\n```\n\nAnd then install in a job, i.e. `npm install @root/somepackage`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nYou should be able to pull it, especially since that works when you do not specify an authToken.\n\n### Root cause\n\nUsers can consume packages from the GitLab package registry in their CI pipelines. Packages belong to projects. It is common for users to authenticate using a CI_JOB_TOKEN when working in CI jobs.\n\nCurrently, if a user consumes/installs a package from a public project in a pipeline for a different project, the package is successfully installed because the request is anonymous, and the code will check `Ability.allowed?(nil, :read_package, public_project)` and `Ability.allowed?(nil, :read_project, public_project)`. Anonymous users have both `:read_package` and `:read_project` permissions for public projects, so both will return `true` and the CI job will succeed.\n\nHowever, if a job is authenticated using the CI_JOB_TOKEN, the code will check `Ability.allowed?(ci_job_token, :build_read_project, public_project)`, which will return `false`, and despite being a public project, the package installation will fail.\n\nSo why are we checking `:build_read_project` instead of `:read_project` (which will return true for the ci_job_token)?\n\nIn the `find_project!` helper, when dealing with CI job token authentication, we try to limit the permissions of the job user. This happens here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/572bb8c0fe055eb32030a8b48764113d8fe2aa6f/ee/lib/ee/api/helpers.rb#L93. You can see that when a user is present, we check `:read_project`, but when a CI_JOB_TOKEN is present, we check `:build_read_project`.\n\n### The Fix\n\nUpdate the permissions to also allow `:build_read_project` for public projects.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-07T18:20:18.796Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T08:48:22.920Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T17:32:54.388Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Package:P2","backend","customer","devops::package","group::package registry","missed-SLO","missed:13.5","priority::2","ruby","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":4374685,"username":"nelbacha","name":"Nourdin el Bacha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ccb111fe4fc66151a0f0480e6b3bcca?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nelbacha"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213723","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213723","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213723/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213723/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213723","relative":"#213723","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213723"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33004773,"iid":213713,"project_id":278964,"title":"Dependency Scanning fails for projects using gradle in offline mode","description":"### Main issue\r\n\r\nThis is a [sub-issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/4588) for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33720.\r\n\r\n### Problem to solve\r\n\r\nIn order to support offline environment deployments (air-gap) for Dependency Scanning on gradle projects, we need to avoid making external calls at runtime in the [gemnasium-maven analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven).\r\n\r\n### Intended users\r\n\r\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\r\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\r\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\r\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\r\n\r\n### Further details\r\n\r\n[gemnasium-maven analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) tries to install `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` and other resources when running. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nbundle all necessary requirements within the [gemnasium-maven analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) docker image or provide a way for users to download it and make it available to the analyzer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan\r\n\r\n- [x] add `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` at build time\r\n- [x] add minimium set of maven plugins required to build gemnasium project\r\n\r\n### Permissions and Security\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

Problem\n\nWhen starting a search from the global nav search bar, results for projects and groups are returned inside of that dropdown. This poses two issues:\n\n1. The dropdown has a noticeable delay to load and show the various scopes while it retrieves those results.\n1. A Maximum of 5 results is returned with no way to navigate to get more or know if that's all of the results.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should remove the search results from the search dropdown. This will help to to speed up the search dropdown and provide information on the available scopes faster, as well as prevent any confusion over those results.\n\n#### Backup plan\n\nIf users found this feature valuable it should be re-implemented with some kind of lazy load so that the scopes are still instantly select-able and then those results can load in later. This will keep the performance of the search up navigation high.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-07T15:34:42.781Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:23:51.481Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T00:22:08.070Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan

Apps Environments for merge request branches are not stopped upon merge/reject","description":"### Summary\nOur current setup follows the review app approach of GitLab. An environment is created for every branch that is part of a merge request, and is supposed to be stopped once the merge request has been accepted/closed. The latter does not work.\n\n```yaml\ndeployReviewApp:\n  # Use an image that provides helm and kubectl\n  image: dtzar/helm-kubectl:3.1.1\n  stage: reviewApp\n  before_script:\n    - prepareDeployment\n  script:\n    - deployReviewApp\n  environment:\n    name: mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID\n    url: http://URL/mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID\n    on_stop: deleteReviewApp\n  only:\n    - merge_requests\n\ndeleteReviewApp:\n  image: dtzar/helm-kubectl:3.1.1\n  stage: reviewApp\n  before_script:\n    - prepareDeletion\n  script:\n    - deleteReviewApp\n  when: manual\n  environment:\n    name: mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID\n    action: stop\n  only:\n    - merge_requests\n```\n\nI am pretty sure this worked about two months ago, where I tested it manually (by creating and closing merge requests).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse the provided snippet above. There is no need to properly set up an application in any way.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe environments are *not* stopped, which leads to tens of instances idling in our cluster.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe environment is stopped once the merge request is accepted/closed, which triggers the deletion of the review app.\n\n### Related issues\n\nThere is a fairly large amount of issues similar to this one, although they are all closed, the described behaviour persists. Multiple entries in forums etc. confirm the correctness of the expected behaviour.\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/7355\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/26102\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/60885","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-07T14:41:59.573Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T13:27:01.359Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T21:54:26.642Z","closed_by":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"labels":["Category:Review Apps","Release::P2","cicd::active","customer","devops::release","environments","group::release","missed:13.1","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"}],"author":{"id":1486596,"username":"DrFelder","name":"Thomas Simon Pötzsch","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f92333bb27b726236a066abaffbd3817?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DrFelder"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5370821,"username":"lexicalunit","name":"Amy Troschinetz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5370821/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lexicalunit"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213684","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213684","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213684/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/213684/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#213684","relative":"#213684","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#213684"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32999075,"iid":213683,"project_id":278964,"title":"Bug in notes creation response","description":"There is a bug introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/commit/b96ca8d90fea96adddf38799da200425daefb399\n\n```ruby\n      # Allow consumers to detect problems applying commands\n      note.errors.add(:commands, _('Commands did not apply')) unless message.present?\n```\n\nThis is incorrect because `message` here actually contains both success and error messages. Meaning, if `message` contained an error, `note.errors[:commands]` won't be set and then in this block of code:\n\n```ruby\n          if note.errors.keys == [:commands_only]\n            status 202\n            present note, with: Entities::NoteCommands\n          elsif note.valid?\n            present note, with: Entities.const_get(note.class.name, false)\n          else\n            note.errors.delete(:commands_only) if note.errors.has_key?(:commands)\n            bad_request!(\"Note #{note.errors.messages}\")\n          end\n```\n\nWe'd always get a `202` even if the quick actions had some errors.\n\nI think we need to clean up how we pass these messages in the response because passing success messages in a model's `error` hash is confusing and can lead to wrong assumptions like this.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWith the iterative implementation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39060 we did not provide a suitable way to control the scope of these settings. When enabling these settings, they are inherited by all projects in an instance. Organizations with regulated projects tend to also have projects that are not regulated and therefore should not inherit these strict controls.\n\n**Problem:** As an `administrator`, I want to be able to selectively apply these controls only to regulated projects, so that I can retain flexibility for my teams in unregulated projects while still meeting my compliance requirements.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* The management stakeholders who adhere to any auditing process. To be defined in a new [Compliance Persona](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/546)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nAfter implementing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39060, we're now focused on narrowing the scope of these settings (currently applies to all projects in an instance) to allow for more granular control. Not all projects in a GitLab instance are regulated for all users. In many cases, only a subset of projects need stringent controls in place for MR approvals. \n\nBefore we can implement this feature, we'll need to ship https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/118671 so we have a signal with which to refine the scope of these settings.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAdd an optional selection criteria to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39060 to allow `admins` to specify what compliance projects to inherit the settings to. For example:\n\n* **Enable approvals by the author** \n   * 🚥 Allow a merge request author to approve their own merge requests.\n* **Enable approval by committers** \n   * 🚥 Allow a merge request committer to approve the merge request they've committed. \n* **Enable approvers list modification** \n   * 🚥 Allow owners and maintainers to modify the approver list for merge requests and override approvals at the individual merge request level. \n\n**These settings will apply to all projects unless you limit the scope to specific project compliance labels:**\n- [X] SOX\n- [X] PCI-DSS\n- [ ] HIPAA\n\n### Prototype and Mockups\n\n[**Figma prototype**](https://www.figma.com/file/CnUPDuQIWz8z2F4DVrjcfj/213601-Allow-admins-to-scope-MR-approval-settings?node-id=4%3A368)\n\n![Group_16](/uploads/ae248056d475528f273446a331946c1f/Group_16.png)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nOnly `administrators` can access and modify this setting\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas.

In the script clean up all ci jobs that have both `license_scanning` and `license_management` artifacts and leave only one of them.

However, the defined scopes of `read_repository`, `read_registry`, and `write_registry` have not allowed you to grant access to the GitLab Package Registry. As a result, DevOps teams have used insecure or expensive user based workarounds.\n\nAs a workaround, users have been either using a project member's [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html), which is dangerous as all project members can access shared runners. Or, creating a dedicated, fake user for each project/group, which is difficult to maintain, costs money and can cause issues with LDAP, SSL for some customers.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Customer quotes\n\n\"We are building images on a server separate from the GitLab CI, these servers need a secure way to handle tokens with push access to the registry\"\n\n#### Existing scopes\n\n- `read_repository`: Allows read-only access to the repository\n- `read_registry`: Allows read-only access to the Container Registry\n\n### Proposal\n\nExpand the scope of GitLab's Deploy tokens to allow reading and writing to the GitLab Package Registry. \n\n#### Iteration\n\n- This issue will focus on the Package Registry, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22743 addressed adding new scopes for the Container Registry.\n\n##### MR Breakdown\n\n| MR | Title | Aspects |\n|----|-------|---------|\n| 1 | Container Registry write access support with a Deploy Token | ~\"backend\", ~\"Category:Container Registry\" |\n| 2 | Add the additional scopes to the UI | ~\"frontend\" |\n| 3 | NPM API authentication with a Deploy Token | ~\"backend\", ~\"NPM Registry\", ~\"Category:Package Registry\" |\n| 4 | Maven API authentication with a Deploy Token | ~\"backend\", ~\"Maven Repository\", ~\"Category:Package Registry\" |\n| 5 | Conan API authentication with a Deploy Token | ~\"backend\", ~\"Conan Repository\", ~\"Category:Package Registry\" |\n| 6 | NuGet API authentication with a Deploy Token | ~\"backend\", ~\"NuGet Repository\", ~\"Category:Package Registry\" |\n| 7 | PyPI API authentication with a Deploy Token | ~\"backend\", ~\"PyPI Repository\", ~\"Category:Package Registry\" |\n\n\n#### Scopes\n\n- `read_repository`: Allows read-only access to the repository\n- `read_container_registry`: Allows read-only access to the Container Registry\n- `write_container_registry`: Allows write access to the Container Registry\n- `read_package_registry`: Allows read-only access to the Package Registry\n- `write_package_registry`: Allows write access to the Package Registry\n\n\n#### User Interface\n\nThe additional scopes should be added to the user interface, with the below language.

Despite being a member of a shared group, member shows up with incorrect/lower permission in the member list.\n1.  The effective role permission seems to take effect for projects within the group, but not the group itself. That is, if a member should have 'maintainer' due to shared groups, they are unable to create a project in the group, but they do have maintainer permission on projects within the group.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.  Create a group (eg. `Fake Company/RBAC/Maintainers`)\n1.  Add some users to the `Maintainers` group\n1.  Create another group (eg. `Fake Company/Fake Team`)\n1.
