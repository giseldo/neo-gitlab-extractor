[{"id":50143585,"iid":224727,"project_id":278964,"title":"Migrate API Fuzzing from dotnet core 2.1 to v3.1","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAPI Fuzzing's scanner currently uses .net core v2.1. Support for v2.1 will end mid 2021. The current long term support (LTS) release is v3.1.\n\nReasons to migrate:\n\n1. [Support for v2.1 ends 8/21/2021](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). v3.1 is the new LTS release.\n1. Native support for gRPC would simplify proposed gRPC support\n1. General performance improvements\n1. New features that could be leveraged by API Fuzzing with additional work\n   1. High performance kestrel web server framework that includes HTTP/2 support.\n   1. New high performance JSON module using no-copy parsing (faster, lower memory usage).\n   1. High performance no-copy buffer system. Any parsing code would see speed improvements.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMigrating to v3.1 is not simple, there are a number of breaking changes on the migration path. @mikeeddington did some exploratory migration work in early 2020.\n\nIdentified steps moving project to v3.1:\n\n1. [X] [Update to dotnet core v2.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/21-to-22?view=aspnetcore-3.1\u0026tabs=visual-studio)\n   1. [X] No breaking changes.\n   1. [X] Get all unit tests passing\n1. [X] [Update to dotnet core v3.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.1\u0026tabs=visual-studio)\n   1. [X] [Numerous breaking changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/2.2-3.1)\n   1. [X] Update project files as needed\n   1. [X] Migrate all dependencies to v3.\n   1. [X] Update to new host system\n   1. [X] Address SignalR breaking changes, or remove SignalR usage\n   1. [X] Understand implications of switch from Newtonsoft Json to Microsoft Json.\n      1. [-] Some features we use are not available in Microsoft json library (has this been addressed in 3.1?)\n      1. [X] May be possible to keep using Newtonsoft json-- Mike: Had issue when trying this.\n   1. [X] Migrate web host to new web host system\n   1. [-] Get all unit tests passing\n1. [X] [Update to dotnet core v3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/30-to-31?view=aspnetcore-3.1\u0026tabs=visual-studio)\n   1. [X] No breaking changes.\n   1. [x] Get all unit tests passing\n1. [X] Update build docker files to use new 3.1 SDK\n1. [X] Update docker files to use new 3.1 runtime\n1. [x] Verify integration tests are working\n1. [x] Manually test scanner UI in development mode\n1. [x] Perform e2e testing of staging\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n1. [X] Remove the custom proxy when migrating to 3.1 SDK. Background, in dotnet core 2.1, the `WebProxy.IsBypassed` returns `true` if the requested Uri points to 127.0.0.1, it ignores the flag `BypassProxyOnLocal` . In dotnet core 3.1 they addressed that behavior. As result C# Runner created a copy of WebProxy from C# 2.1, and removed that specific validation as it is in dotnet core 3.1. [Issue 273111](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273111)\n1. [x] Remove Diagnostics check introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326349\n\n### Links / references\n\n- [v2.1 -\u003e v2.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/21-to-22?view=aspnetcore-3.1\u0026tabs=visual-studio)\n- [v2.2 -\u003e v3.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.1\u0026tabs=visual-studio)\n  - [Breaking changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/2.2-3.1)\n- [v3.0 -\u003e v3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/30-to-31?view=aspnetcore-3.1\u0026tabs=visual-studio)\n- [v3.1 -\u003e v5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/31-to-50?view=aspnetcore-5.0\u0026tabs=visual-studio)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-25T00:30:27.292Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:51.293Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T15:08:14.643Z","closed_by":{"id":7488329,"username":"herbmadrigal","name":"Herber Madrigal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7488329/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/herbmadrigal"},"labels":["Category:Fuzz Testing","backend","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":7488329,"username":"herbmadrigal","name":"Herber Madrigal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7488329/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/herbmadrigal"}],"author":{"id":2166365,"username":"mikeofpeach","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2166365/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeofpeach"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7488329,"username":"herbmadrigal","name":"Herber Madrigal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7488329/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/herbmadrigal"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/224727","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":22,"completed_count":22},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"22 of 22 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224727","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224727/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/224727/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#224727","relative":"#224727","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#224727"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29929019,"iid":198729,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add test to shared component in web ide","description":"Increase test converge for `changed_file_icon` and `file_row.vue` within the `vue_shared` folder.\n\nThere was a recent regression due this MR \u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22364 that caused some severe issues.\n\nSo let's fix that!

Using a [primary button](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#primary) for navigating back to the security dashboard is not optimal:\n\n\u003e Primary buttons are the single most important action that moves the task forward within a context and thus have the most emphasis placed upon them. There should only be one call to action in any given context. Primary buttons are recognized by their solid color, bold text labels, and must use one of the four elementary button styles: Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (orange), or Danger (red).\n\n2. Also, the [green color](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/colors) is used for saving or adding:\n\n\u003e Green indicates success. It communicates: save, create, add, available, done, approved, or resolved.\n\n#### Summary \n\nWhile the green primary button is correctly used below in the _Add projects_ button, using a green primary button for navigating back to the security dashboard is confusing and against the design system guidelines mentioned above.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nChange the green primary button for navigating back to the security dashboard to a [tertiary button](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#tertiary).\n\n\u003e A tertiary button is the default button category.

The feedback loop of unit tests today is too slow unless they manually re-arrange the tests to be run early in the pipeline or even in a separate test job before the rest of the unit tests. This isn't efficient so they just let the tests run normally which can take awhile and you lose context of the change making the fixes slower than idea.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n* If you're utilizing TDD and naming test files consistently like code files you want to test those that are newly changed first.\n* Pipeline failures due to unit tests failures are going to happen quicker which is *cheaper* because tests very likely to pass and other steps of the pipeline are run less often. \n\n### Proposal\n\n~~Expose a new predefined CI variable, `CI_PIPELINE_MODIFIED_PATHS`. Using that,~~ (Removed from MVC, but leaving here for posterity because the variable work is in limbo)\n\nWe can configure a pipeline stage before `test` that uses that list of file paths to make some educated guesses about which files should be relevent and run only those files. There's a detailed description [below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198550#note_303171352).\n\nGitlab can configure this very specifically for the pipelines that we believe will benefit the most, i.e,\n```yaml\nrspec-early-warning:\n  stage: pre-test-triage\n  script: rspec \u003cfancy sed work\u003e\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TITLE =~ /^WIP/i\n```\n\nThis particular usage is specifically geared toward a developer work on the `gitlab`, sending changes up to an open merge request that's still being worked on. We can talk to ~Quality and ~\"Engineering Productivity\" to see if they have other ideas about where this would be particularly efficient (e.g. not on `master`).\n\nAfter we try this configuration out for ourselves, we can write up some engineering blog posts about what we found to be most and least efficient, and then decide if any of the best outcomes can be packaged into something more automatic within `gitlab` itself.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n* No documentation needed for this MVC but we'll want to think about convention of naming files and document that in the future.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n#### Possible risks\n\nAs a POC there don't appear to be significant risks\n\n*  If we build this in as a template we'd want to be up front the likelihood for an increase in % of pipelines that fail\n*  Given the difficulty in selecting appropriate tests, this could build some degree of false confidence, but considering how we handle the rest of our testing, this should be mostly mitigated. From an external customer point of view, this could be more of an issue.\n\n#### Required Testing\n\n*  Would need to include in current AutoDevOps E2E tests\n*  package-and-qa not required\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* The outcome we're striving for is to create a POC we can then build into a template for users.\n* A successful POC will allow users to write CI configuration based on the value of the modified paths in their merge request.\n* Secondary success is that we reduce the number of runner minutes / change after using this method.\n\n* We can measure this by setting up a Periscope dashboard with CI usage statistics in it. We could be able to see the total minutes and average minutes consumed across all pipelines on a project that implements our POC, and be able to break out pipelines by `ci_status` and whatever criteria we use to trigger early-warning tests, e.g. branch vs detached pipelines.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nWhen this is a full blown feature the buyer is a VP of Dev who is looking to reduce runner minutes on failed pipeline runs.\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

For missing dependencies considering pulling the `nuspec` definition from the [nuget api](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/package-base-address-resource#download-package-manifest-nuspec)\n\nConsider supporting the same file parsers that is listed [here](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/tree/master/nuget/lib/dependabot/nuget/file_parser).\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n* [ ] Install all packages for a nuget project to a known location.\n* [ ] Exclude development/test dependencies from nuget restore step.\n* [ ] Scan for all the `*.nupkg` files in the vendored location.\n* [ ] Add a dependency entry for each `*.nupkg` file discovered in vendored location instead of parsing the `*.csproj` `\u003cpackage\u003e` references.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-23T16:24:45.168Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T03:17:32.272Z","closed_at":"2023-01-04T16:15:02.738Z","closed_by":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","section::sec","type::feature","upstream deps"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

The merge-base method should not be available any more.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-02-26_at_2.21.48_PM](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/uploads/38429ea71c2686419c331efef3061f3e/Screen_Shot_2019-02-26_at_2.21.48_PM.png)\n\n## Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-23T01:44:38.302Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T15:19:25.445Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T05:33:10.386Z","closed_by":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::create","direction","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::code review","missed-deliverable","missed:13.1","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},{"id":142752,"username":"garyh","name":"Gary Holtz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/142752/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/garyh"}],"author":{"id":1187333,"username":"jramsay-gitlab","name":"James Ramsay (ex-GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1187333/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jramsay-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":50,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198458","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198458","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198458/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198458/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#198458","relative":"#198458","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#198458"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":854,"epic":{"id":4574,"iid":854,"title":"🧮 Use merge refs for diffs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/854","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29867757,"iid":198456,"project_id":278964,"title":"Disable Auto Update of ZAP addons on DAST startup","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen DAST/ZAP starts, it accesses an [XML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-dev.xml) to determine what ZAP plugins are available, and what their latest versions are.

If you are mentioned in a comment it's critical to be able to follow the Todo and either take action or mark as done. It's also important to be able to give yourself Todos when you need to remember to work on something or come back later.\n\nUp until now, \"marking as done\" and \"add todo\" was not available on Design comments. This really impaired the effectiveness of communication between Designs other workflows. \n\nAs of 13.4, Designs achieve parity with Issue comments and their use of Todos for a more consistent and useful experience.\n\n\n\n### Job story\n\n**When** going to a design from a to-do, **I want to** mark it done, **so I can** mark it complete without having to take action.\n\n### Proposal from @jareko \n\n* Duplicate \"Mark as done\" and \"Add a To Do\" functionality in the design view\n* Clicking \"Mark as done\" would remove the associated To Do from your To Do's list\n* Clicking \"Add a To Do\" would add a To Do to your To Do's list\n* See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/198439/designs and\n* Specs in Sketch Cloud: https://sketch.cloud/s/wM7Qp/a/eY23Vp\n\nThanks @vkarnes!\n\ncc @cdybenko\n\n### ~frontend work\n\n#### Exposing a user Todo on a design\n\nThe ~frontend should be able to leverage an existing [todo component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/todo_toggle/todo.vue). For the sake of reusability and abstraction, I believe it should be moved to `vue_shared`. This component is 'dumb' and could be easily integrated to work with old Rails API/new GraphQL API.\n\n#### Adding a ToDo\n\nFor MVC 1, adding a ToDo will be implemented the same way we have in `Epics` application: with old Rails API. I would recommend wrapping this API call in the local mutation, so\n\n- we could easily update Apollo cache\n- we could switch fast from this local mutation to 'real' mutation as soon as we have MVC 2\n\n#### Marking as `Done`\n\nWe will use an existing GraphQL mutation `todoMarkDone`. Why it's preferable over Rails API endpoint here: because we will be fetching a design to-do status as a GraphQL field, and with the mutation, we can easily update an Apollo cache. Also, it won't need any refactoring on MVC 2\n\n### ~backend work\n\n(See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198439#note_338539784):\n\n##### Adding a Todo, and Marking as Done\n\n- The backend should be able to `Mark as Done` for a Design already as there is an existing GraphQL mutation for this\n- There will be a small amount of work needed by the ~backend to support `Add a To Do` for designs by updating the old Rails controllers - [we need to add the ability to find the design for the Todo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/12ee2753c1e27c0c9480a8e79db2463ba51ba3ec/app/controllers/projects/todos_controller.rb#L11) - as we are missing a GraphQL mutation for creating a Todo.\n\n##### Exposing a user Todo on a design\n\nWe'll need a new `field` on the Design that will expose a user's Todos. We already have a `TodoType`, so we would be exposing something to [what is exposed for issuables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/be92953574a1aeed150597af4e9ccad84a084bdb/app/serializers/issuable_sidebar_basic_entity.rb#L26-28) through a new `field`.\n\nI think the trick here would be to introduce `Batchloading` for finding these Todos, to avoid the N+1 performance issue that the current `User#pending_todo_for` would introduce if we were to use it. This would add a little extra complexity to the task, but would be worth it.\n\nIt could be nice to do this field in a way that was reusable for other Todoables in future. Perhaps through a new field type (like `markdown_field`), or a new `implements`. We could canvass #f_graphql about the best approach to this.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-22T21:34:25.521Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:59:12.047Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T03:17:09.567Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","Deliverable","backend","backend-weight::3","devops::plan","direction","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::product planning","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::canary"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":2222493,"username":"jareko","name":"Jarek Ostrowski","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2222493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jareko"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"user_notes_count":45,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198439","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198439","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198439/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198439/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#198439","relative":"#198439","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#198439"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2582,"epic":{"id":18935,"iid":2582,"title":"🐶 Design Management dogfooding priority issues","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2582","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29865074,"iid":198438,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow admins to mark Users as service users","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently the app is unable to distinguish between Users intended to represent humans, and Users intended to represent bots and other automated entities.  GitLab EE has a concept of `User#bot_type`, but currently that only distinguishes GitLab-specific bots.  Admin-created service users, like GitLab's own @gitlab-bot, look just like ordinary Users to the app.  That is a problem for features like [Code Review Analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/38062), which is [currently unable to ignore custom bot \"service user\" comments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/198095) as it needs to.\n\nAdding a \"service user\" flag is also the first step toward other features, including:\n\n- [ignoring service users in licensing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6883)\n- [making bot activity visually distinct from human activity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6883#note_201105205)\n- [improving security by making service user accounts more restricted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6883#note_201105205)\n\n### Proposal\n\nFor all paid tiers (Bronze/Starter tiers and above): \n\n- There is a checkbox for \"Service User\" on the admin User creation page (/admin/users/new)\n- Service Users cannot have DeployKeys or DeployTokens\n- GitLab bots are considered service users\n\nFor example:\n\n![service_user_checkbox](/uploads/8a5eb182e6309dde4461a83a47d3cebf/service_user_checkbox.png)\n\n### Out of scope\n\nThe API is out of scope, because only one mechanism is necessary for an MVC and the API would probably be used much less often than the admin area.  The spec for the API would be: A boolean attribute for `service_user` is accepted when creating (POST /api/v4/users) or updating (PUT /api/v4/users/:id) a User ([documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#user-creation)).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nAdmin permissions are required to create a `service_user` or mark an existing User as a `service_user`.

Rename `license_management` directories to `license_compliance` (The license_management directory originally contained all the vue code related to managing license policies and the \"Policies\" tab in license compliance)\n\n*  Rename `project_licenses` directories to 'license_compliance' (The project_licenses directory originally contained all the vue code for the license compliance page and

This is implemented using child pipelines.\n- Update the README of `gemnasium` to reflect this change, and reset the CHANGELOG.\n- Keep [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven) and [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python) to maintain v2 branch, but update the README to indicate that v3 lives in `gemnasium`.\n\n`gemnasium-maven:3` and `gemnasium-python:3` are published in the `SEC_REGISTRY`, but not in the Container Registry of `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python`.\n\nThe temporary images are `gemnasium/tmp`, `gemnasium/maven/tmp`, and `gemnasium/python/tmp`. These images are pushed to the Container Registry of the `gemnasium` project.\n\nThe `gemnasium` project has a parent pipeline that runs the unit tests and lint the code, and child pipelines that build, test, and release the images, using `trigger` jobs. It includes `go.yml` and `upsert-git-tag.yml`.\n\nEach child pipeline corresponds to a \"build directory\" that contains `Dockerfile`, `main.go`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and files that are specific to the build. For instance, `build/gemnasium-python` contains the files needed to build the `gemnasium-python` image.\n\nChild pipelines include `docker.yml` and `docker-test.yml`. They use CI variables introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/298 to build, test, and release distinct images.\n\n```yaml\ngemnasium:\n  variables:\n    # registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/tmp\n    TMP_IMAGE_PATH: \"/tmp\"\n    # registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\n    # IMAGE_PATH: keep default value\n    # registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium\n    # SEC_REGISTRY: keep default value\n\ngemnasium-maven:\n  variables:\n    # registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/tmp/maven\n    TMP_IMAGE_PATH: \"/tmp/maven\"\n    # registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/maven\n    IMAGE_PATH: \"/maven\"\n    # registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-maven\n    SEC_REGISTRY_IMAGE: \"$SEC_REGISTRY/gemnasium-maven\"\n\ngemnasium-python:\n  variables:\n    # registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/tmp/python\n    TMP_IMAGE_PATH: \"/tmp/python\"\n    # registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/python\n    IMAGE_PATH: \"/python\"\n    # registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-python\n    SEC_REGISTRY_IMAGE: \"$SEC_REGISTRY/gemnasium-python\"\n```\n\nThe Container Scanning jobs (defined in `docker-test.yml`) are disabled in the child pipelines because their security reports wouldn't be processed in the Rails backend. So instead, these jobs are defined in the parent pipeline, and they cover all images.\n\nFIPS jobs need to be updated because there's no `Dockerfile.fips` in the root directory, so the `rules:exists` doesn't apply.\n\n`image test` jobs need to be updated, and `image_spec.rb` need to move to separate directories, or be named after the image being tested.\n\nUser documentation doesn't change.\n\nDeveloper documentation is updated to reflect this new workflow.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/294\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/126\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1.

[x] Check user documentation\n   - Make sure that user docs only mentions images store in the `SEC_REGISTRY`.\n\n## Improvements\n\n- There's only one CHANGELOG, README, CI config, etc..\n- Any change to `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven` or `gemnasium-python` can be implemented in a single MR in `gemnasium`; releasing that change is as simple as merging the MR and creating a git tag in `gemnasium`. \n- It's possible to perform full QA when working on a MR, using all 3 images and all supported test projects.\n\n## Risks\n\nNo risk has been identified, but cascading pipelines might result in an inconsistent build state when the build partially fails. \n\n## Involved components\n\n* [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium)\n* [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python)\n* [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven)\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\nWe rebuild all images even when some are not impacted by the change.\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\nNone","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-22T13:04:19.204Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T17:03:48.955Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T16:11:14.191Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","missed:15.0","priority::3","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":56,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198361","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":9,"completed_count":8},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 9 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198361","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198361/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198361/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#198361","relative":"#198361","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#198361"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5023,"epic":{"id":157152,"iid":5023,"title":"Merge all 3 gemnasium projects","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5023","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":29846046,"iid":198358,"project_id":278964,"title":"API: Rename services to integrations","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39129 we decided that we want to rename `project services` to `integrations`.

After first tests it looks like the trigger jobs (and therefore a whole parent pipeline) never times out if it references:\n*  Non-existing YML file\n*  Empty YML file\n*  Incorrect YML files (incorrectly structured, failing CI Lint)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a project with `.gitlab-ci.yml` containing trigger job to a child pipeline referencing non-existing file\n```yml\nstages:\n  - test\n\n# Expect it to fail\ntrigger_simple: \n  stage: test\n  trigger:\n    include:\n      - local: /unknown-file.yml\n```\n2. Run pipeline and observe that pipeline will remain in **Running** state without any errors being thrown\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/dzalbo/test-parent-child-pipeline\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nParent pipelines does not fail and does not display any errors when child pipeline is incorrect (or a YML file is missing entirely)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI would expect Trigger job to fail (and therefore the whole pipeline to fail (at least if `strategy: depend` is used)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/91791ee6b7767e7b9198881e8fde94bf/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\n/cc @fabiopitino

activity items with links to that associated activity. Below is what the activity looks like:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-01-21_at_11.28.11_AM](/uploads/9baf48def6f8e77a602ffabf12c287fe/Screen_Shot_2020-01-21_at_11.28.11_AM.png)\n\nThe actual contributions were made on this design [this design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35860/designs/project-dashboard-hover-on-remediation-badge.png).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUnsure, may have to do with settings or permissions on that user. Or could be a bug with how we handle design comment activity. \n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDespite these comments being under the public GitLab project, and this person being a `Developer` under this project, it still puts these in as a `Private` activity item. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe correct behavior would be to show these as normal, public activity items so this person can click on the link to bring them to the associated design comment. That is of course, if it's a public issue in a public project. This is how they get back to designs they were on earlier, by using their own activity feed, but these aren't showing up because they're private, even in their own activity feed. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee top.\n\n### Output of checks\n\n(If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)\n\ncc @vkarnes @alexkalderimis @.luke @toupeira @cdybenko @rkuba @ntepluhina","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-21T19:06:07.447Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:59:12.813Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T15:55:36.525Z","closed_by":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","Deliverable","backend","devops::plan","group::product planning","missed:12.9","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":2222493,"username":"jareko","name":"Jarek Ostrowski","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2222493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jareko"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198120","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198120","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198120/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198120/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#198120","relative":"#198120","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#198120"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29818635,"iid":198098,"project_id":278964,"title":"Audit -

The lock file lists all the project dependencies, including the transient dependencies, that is the dependencies of the dependencies. Users don't manually edit the lock file. Instead, they edit the main dependency file, and declare top-level dependencies the project explicitly uses. It's the packager manager's responsibility to build the full dependency list, and store that list into a lock file.\n\nMost lock files give the exact relationship between the dependencies, but this information is currently ignored when parsing the files, in the [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/) analyzer project.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn the Dependency List, show a path between a vulnerable, transient dependency and a top-level dependency. The UI shows only one path, but it makes it clear that there might be other paths leading to that dependency.\n\nIn order to show the dependency path in the UI, the Gemnasium analyzer builds a [dependency graph](#note_353706006), and leverages this graph to calculate paths to the vulnerable dependencies; these paths are added to the Dependency Scanning report. The addition to the [Dependency Scanning report format](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/master/dist/dependency-scanning-report-format.json) is to be defined.\n\nTechnically, Gemnasium builds and queries the dependency graph [using a Go library](#note_353751356) like [gonum/path](https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum@v0.7.0/graph/encoding/dot?tab=doc). See [Proof of Concept](#note_353762079): https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/81\n\n### Supported languages and package managers\n\nSee [supported languages and package managers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers) in Dependency Scanning documentation, and related [discussion](#note_353662386).\n\nThe dependency graph can be built from the lock file when it's in the project repository and supported (as this is the case for Bundler, npm, yarn, and PHP Composer), except for Go modules.\n\nWhen there's no lock file, or when it's not supported, the graph can be built from the output of the command Gemnasium uses to list the transient dependencies, like `pipdeptree` or the Gemnasium plugins for Java. The latter makes possible to support pip, Pipenv, Gradle, Maven, and Sbt.\n\nThere's no dependency graph for Go projects because `go.sum` doesn't provide the information needed to build the graph. All other package managers are supported. The [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html) should document this limitation.\n\nAlso, in the case we implement lock file support for pip or Pipenv, these lock files would not provide the information needed to build the dependency graph.\n\nIn the future, we'll be able to build a dependency graph from `poetry.lock`, the lock file [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) generates.\n\n### Next steps\n\n- The UI might show other paths, in a modal view for instance. See [discussion](#note_361836165).\n- Gemnasium will favor a dependency path that connects the transient dependency to a runtime top-level dependency. These paths are more important than the ones that connect to development dependencies. See [discussion](#note_353796988).\n- The dependency path is shown for all components listed in the Dependency List, and not only for the affected one. For this to be implemented, it's necessary to export the full dependency graph.\n- The full dependency graph is exported as a job artifact, to be processed by the Rails backend and/or the frontend. The graph might be exported as part of the BoM. See [discussion](#note_353742622).\n- In case the lock file doesn't provide enough information to build the graph, the Gemnasium analyzer runs a command to get the data that's needed. In particular, it runs `go mod graph` to get graph information for projects using Go modules.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html) tells for which package managers the dependency paths are available.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThe dependency path is part of the generated Dependency Scanning report, and checked during QA for gemnasium, gemnasium-maven, and gemnasium-python.\n\nAlso, feature tests are needed to ensure dependency paths are presented in the UI, when the data is available.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers can easily explore the dependency path that leads from a vulnerable dependency listed in a lock file (or not listed at all if there's no lock file) to the main requirements file. Ultimately, they understand what causes the vulnerable dependency to be installed.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198034\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-21T08:50:21.583Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T05:57:18.769Z","closed_at":"2020-07-10T12:37:50.166Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["AST Leadership","Category:Dependency Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","UX","backend","customer","dependency list","design::discovery","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","quad-planning::complete-no-action","type::feature","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"user_notes_count":113,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/198034","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198034","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198034/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/198034/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#198034","relative":"#198034","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#198034"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3843,"epic":{"id":78549,"iid":3843,"title":"Show paths to dependencies MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3843","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":29786713,"iid":198016,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document container scanning remediation configuration","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35433 added support for remediating vulnerabilities found during a Docker container scan.

the Package Registry UI to view different versions of the same package","description":"~\"frontend-weight::2\" \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe Package stage allows you to publish, consume and discover packages, all in one place. Users publish and pull packages using GitLab CI/CD, the command line or the GitLab API.\n\nDurring the troubleshooting process, users have repeatedly stated that understanding the different versions of a package, as well as the changes happening between each version, would be incredibly helpful but is currently unavailable. This currently leads to users looking at individual packages on their desktop to understand the changes that have occurred over the evolution of the package.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposed solution is to add a \"versions\" tab in the package detail UI that lists out other versions of packages uploaded to the registry with the same namespace.  included in the view is a list of the packages with the relevant data being displayed.  \n\nHere is the UI: \n![Versions_tab_MVC](/uploads/0bc1eae252c1501023428db776cbdb7f/Versions_tab_MVC.png)\n\n### Further details\n\n- The addition of the commit message in the list view (via expandable control maybe) could really bump up the relevance of the versions view.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [Update the section of the docs about using the UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/#view-additional-package-information)Screenshots of the package detail view should be updated to include the tabbed navigation.\n- A section of the documentation should include and explain the versions tab (how the packages are connected, where the data is coming from, etc.)\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? \n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Plese use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance : https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWe will know we are successful if we can increase the adoption and usage of the Package Registry UI. \n\n#### Metrics\n- The North Star metric of `total number of packages pushed/pulled`\n- Pageviews to `/packages` (segmented by tab)\n\n### Links /

matches c# erroneously","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nIn the [SAST template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/445de27b0f5b9e40c6ec49fc788c44b0592e4ca1/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L101) we have the following regexp to match c/c++ in the project languages: `/\\b(c\\+\\+|c)\\b/`.\n\nHowever, since # is not a word boundary character, \"c#\" is also matched by this and flawfinder runs erroneously for c# projects.\n\nInitially reported by customer in [ZD](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/144262) (internal only).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\nirb(main):061:0\u003e var = Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Expression::Lexeme::Variable.new(\"LANG\")                               \nirb(main):062:0\u003e patt = Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Expression::Lexeme::Pattern.new('/\\b(c\\+\\+|c)\\b/')                     \nirb(main):067:0\u003e Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Expression::Lexeme::Matches.new(var, patt).evaluate(LANG: \"c#\")       \n=\u003e true\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nC# projects get matched for flawfinder to run.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nC# project should not be matched for flawfinder.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nPossibly update the regexp in [the SAST template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/445de27b0f5b9e40c6ec49fc788c44b0592e4ca1/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L101).\n\nThe customer mentioned using this regex: `/((^c(\\+\\+)?,)|,c(\\+\\+)?,|(c(\\+\\+)?$))/`, or a workaround until the regexp is fixed, to disable flowfinder completely unless specifically enabled, like:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/sast-gitlab-ci.yml

There is the possibility of cross-selling in this use case to encourage users to use Ci/CD to provide more robust data, but I'd suggest that move to a new issue.\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-20T14:05:45.272Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T07:09:40.720Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T10:07:16.823Z","closed_by":{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick Kipling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nkipling"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","UX","devops::package","direction","frontend","group::package registry","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick Kipling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nkipling"}],"author":{"id":4265456,"username":"icamacho","name":"Iain Camacho","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4265456/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/icamacho"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4087042,"username":"nkipling","name":"Nick Kipling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4087042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nkipling"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197926","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197926","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197926/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/197926/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#197926","relative":"#197926","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#197926"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2442,"epic":{"id":17882,"iid":2442,"title":"Update the User Interface (UI) for the package registry to include additional meta data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2442","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29765541,"iid":197923,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use the Package Registry UI list view to view more robust data","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe Package stage allows you to publish, consume and discover packages, all in one place.
