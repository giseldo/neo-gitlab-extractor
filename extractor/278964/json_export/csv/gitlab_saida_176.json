While this has to be initiated by the group's Owner, this edge case has the potential to effectively subvert SSO enforcement.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* When SSO enforcement is enabled for a group, present an error if:\n  * A user attempts to share a project in the group outside the top-level group. \n  * A user attempts to add members to the project who are not members of the group enforcing GMA.\n* This should apply to projects in the GMA group, as well as projects forked from those projects.\n* Sharing projects with subgroups within the top level group should be possible.\n\n\"GMA\" here refers to Group Managed Accounts.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? \n\n* Any existing access of groups outside the top level GMA group shared with a project in a GMA group gets revoked. (Would this be intentional/expected behaviour?)\n* For forked projects, any existing access of groups outside the top level GMA group shared with the forked project in a GMA group gets revoked.\n* The restriction is applied to SSO enabled groups that do not have GMA enabled. \n* [Share with group lock](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#share-with-group-lock) functionality breaks and allows sharing with groups with the same top-level group.\n\nWhat additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?\n\nTests and at unit and feature level should provide enough coverage. New End-to-end tests should not be required however, we should run the `package-and-qa` job before merging to ensure current tests are fine.\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nHow might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-26T00:29:56.107Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T11:48:33.338Z","closed_at":"2020-03-09T17:57:55.977Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab.com Priority","Kickoff Highlight","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","gitlab.com","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","missed:12.4","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-action","saml","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2982208,"username":"mksionek","name":"Gosia Ksionek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2982208/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mksionek"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":3,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12420","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12420","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12420/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12420/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12420","relative":"#12420","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12420"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1785,"epic":{"id":11091,"iid":1785,"title":"Group SSO: Stability, Availability, and Security","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1785","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22248347,"iid":12417,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add messages to warn and stop users when attempting to change the path of projects with NPM packages","description":"The following discussion from !13986 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @engwan started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/13986#note_184928635):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e Thanks @sabrams. Left more comments.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Also a question: What happens to the packages when project / group paths are renamed?\n\n## Problem \n\nIf a user renames a project or group path when the project contains NPM packages, the NPM functionality will fail, `npm publish` and `npm install` will no longer work because the name is validated and searched for based on the project path.\n\nOnce #9960 is resolved and !13986 is merged, the `npm install` functionality will work because packages will be found based on package name, not based on project path. However there will be problems with `npm publish` if the root namespace (i.e. `foo` in `gitlab.com/foo/my-subgroup/my-project`) is changed. This can occur if `foo` is a top level group and the path to that group is updated. It can also occur if `my-subgroup` or `my-project` is transferred out of `foo`. \n\n## Proposal\n\nWhen a user attempts to change the path to a project that contains a container registry with tags, the path does not update, and the user sees an error saying \"Cannot rename project because it contains container registry tags!\".\n\nWe should implement a similar blocking error if a user attempts to rename a top level group (the root namespace) that contains NPM packages, as well as if a user attempts to move any project or subgroup that contains NPM packages.\n\n### Other considerations\n\nAll other packages registries (i.e. Maven) should be considered as well.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-25T21:57:48.570Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T11:31:28.434Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T10:57:21.308Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::package","documentation","frontend","group::package registry","missed-deliverable","missed:12.5","package:active","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12417","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12417","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12417/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12417/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12417","relative":"#12417","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12417"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22244546,"iid":12412,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document DS_PIP_DEPENDENCY_PATH option for Dependency Scanning and add to vendored template","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nTo address https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/merge_requests/11 we've added an option to specify a path to the installed python pip dependencies.\n\nWe should document this new option and allow to use this variable from the Dependency Scanning vendored template.\n\n### Intended users\n~\"Persona: Software developer\" \n\n### Proposal\n\n* [x] rename the `PIP_DEPENDENCY_PATH` environment variable in [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/e5c7dd5c961d736a4f0b0b3fa1a12177782c3fa0/analyze.go#L27) into `DS_PIP_DEPENDENCY_PATH`.

projects the private groups will be disclosed in service desk emails.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\n\nGo to gitlab.com create public project in your own profile \n\nmy user name is hack2hackgitab i created the project at https://gitlab.com/hack2hackgitab/test-project-hackerone-gitlab/\n\n\nEncourage users to submit service desk emails.\n\nIn service desk emails reply from victim side to the attacker. and save the email for future attack.\n\n\nNext victim tries to transfer his project to any private group and in real scenario the public project becomes private when you transfer the public project to private group.\n\nNow victim transfers his public project to private group https://gitlab.com/private-test-group-hackerone/test-project-hackerone-gitlab\n\n\nafter transferring when you reply to the attackers service desk emails the private group is getting disclosed.\n\n![private_groups_disclosed_in_service_desk_emails_during_transferring_the_public_project.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/e830182a-087d-46af-b71c-2534d73ef394/private_groups_disclosed_in_service_desk_emails_during_transferring_the_public_project.png)\n\nBy this attacker can view the private group names in service desk emails after transferring the public project to private groups.\n\nAnd from next time if the user transfers his project from one private group  another group. The private groups also disclosed.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe attacker will able to disclose the private group names in service desk emails when the public project is transferred to private group.\n\n##

#616327](https://hackerone.com/reports/616327)** by `mclaren650sspider` on 2019-06-16, assigned to `jmatos_bgtvf`:\n\n### Summary\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive information from private repositories. When user's access is revoked from the repository, the user can still access the repository. This is possible due to lack of access control check.\n\nWhen user runs command `git archive --remote origin -o archive.zip --format zip HEAD`, behind the scenes, Git connects to the remote server via SSH and executes the command `git-upload-archive user/repo` on the remote server. Arguments such as format of the archive are given via the stdin to the process. However, the client can wait as long as it wants before sending any arguments to the process. When the arguments are finally received, the `git-upload-archive` process creates archive of the repository and sends it to the client. The server does not check that the user still has the access before creating and sending the archive.\n\nWhile the user still has access to the repository, they can create a SSH connection and initiate `git-upload-archive` process. After the access is removed from the user, the user can send necessary data to the process and receive the repository with the changes made after the access was removed. As there is no limit on how long SSH connection or process can run, the repository could be fetched weeks, months or even years after the removal of the access.  \nSimilarly, it is possible to use the same technique to write to the repository with `git-receive-pack` command.\n\n### Steps to reproduce  \nNode.js is needed to run the PoC. The latest version should work fine, I used Node v8.9.1 myself.\n\n 1. Create two accounts, let's call them A and B. A creates private repository and adds B as an collaborator (under Settings-\u003eMembers). Change value of the variable `TEST_REPO` in PoC's server.js file to the name of the repository.  \n 2. Initialize the private repository with some data. Clone the repository to any directory.  \n 3. Generate and add SSH key to the account B. Save it to file `B_private_key` in the PoC directory.  \n 4. Run PoC with `node server.js`.  \n 5. Remove B from collaborators.  \n 6. Make modifications with account A to the files of the repository. This is necessary to make sure that the modifications made after the removal of access are included in the archive as well.  \n 7. In the previously cloned repo, execute the following commands to change the origin:  \n`git remote remove origin \u0026\u0026 git remote add origin ssh://127.0.0.1:7410/testrepo`  \nNote that the repo name in the URL does not matter in this step.  \n 8. Run the archive command to retrieve the repository:  \n`git archive --remote origin -o archive.zip --format zip HEAD`  \n 9. The repository is now in the `archive.zip` file.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nCurrently, users can access repositories from which their access has been removed.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe expected behavior is that the users can not access the repositories after their access has been revoked.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n## Impact\n\nDue to this vulnerability, the attacker can access sensitive information from private repositories. In addition, attacker can modify the content in the repositories and possibly add malicious code.\n\nThere are numerous scenarios in which this bug could be abused. For instance, when an employee is terminated at a company, the ex-employee could steal sensitive information from company's servers months or even years after the termination. In addition, this method leaves no evidence behind.\n\nIf an attacker gains access to someone with access to the private repository, the attacker can retrieve data even after the compromised user has changed their credentials.\n\n## Attachments\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n* [GitlabPoC.zip](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c5c1ceef-6ae5-41e9-88b6-f14dc201dafc/GitlabPoC.zip)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-24T15:00:52.965Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T22:15:06.584Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T14:28:00.738Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"labels":["Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","repository","security","severity::3","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-09-20","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29660","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29660","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29660/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29660/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#29660","relative":"#29660","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#29660"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22193890,"iid":12375,"project_id":278964,"title":"elastic: Allow maximum bulk request size to be configured","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nElasticsearch clusters have a \"batch API\", which is used extensively when submitting repository data. Clusters are configured to have a maximum request size which varies by cluster. In particular, in AWS, smaller ES instances are configured to have a maximum batch size of 10MiB, while larger instances are configured to have a maximum batch size of 100MiB.\n\nCurrently, we hard-code bulk request API sizes on the client to 10MiB. This is to allow us to fit into \"small\" AWS elastic node resource limits. However, it's much more normal for the maximum bulk request size to be 100MiB than 10MiB on normal-sized nodes.\n\n### Intended users\n\nInstance administrators wrestling with elasticsearch :sweat_smile:\n\n### Further details\n\nBulk request API slots are a limited resource - each shard has 200 slots by default, and once they're full, the bulk API endpoint starts to reject requests, which is expensive and needs retries that we don't currently have (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12372). So artificially making these numbers *even more restricted* is bad for us. Further reading on this is here: https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-am-i-seeing-bulk-rejections-in-my-elasticsearch-cluster\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a setting to configure the maximum batch request size in the elasticsearch section of the admin panel. This would just be another box next to the \"Elasticsearch Shards\" and replicas setting. Users can then set this to a value that makes sense for their elasticsearch cluster.\n\nPeople can set up their own elasticsearch clusters with arbitrary limits, so I don't think limiting to the AWS tiers makes much sense. We should probably default to 10MiB so we work in the broadest range of cases though.\n\nOn GitLab.com, I'd love to set it to 100MiB - that would drastically reduce the number of bulk-indexing failures we see, which is super-valuable at initial backfill indexing time, as well as under high `git push` load.\n\nI don't think it's introspectable from the elastic cluster. If it were, we could autodetect instead of making it configurable.\n\nThe setting needs to be respected both by the `es_import` method (so `Gitlab::Elastic::Client.build` needs to take it into account) and by `gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer` (so we pass it through in `ELASTIC_CONNECTION_INFO`, overriding the currently hardcoded numbers here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer/blob/master/elastic/client.go#L28).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nOnly for instance admins\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe'll need to update https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html\n\n### Testing\n\nUnit testing in both the gitlab-ee and gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer projects\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWe can index projects against large AWS indexes more efficiently\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Starter\"\n\n### Links / references\n\ncc

Intelligently retry bulk-insert failures when indexing","description":"### Summary\n\nDiscovered while working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/800\n\nWe use the elastic bulk insert API to index many documents quickly. This is true for all repository content, and also for the initial import of database content.\n\nIt is a **design feature** of elasticsearch that some bulk-inserts can fail: https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-am-i-seeing-bulk-rejections-in-my-elasticsearch-cluster - essentially, it's a backoff mechanism: too much parallelism would cause the elasticsearch server to drown in a queue of updates, so it rejects some requests.\n\nHowever, we don't handle this well on the GitLab side. For bulk-indexing database content, we **silently ignore** the failures. I've observed this cause, e.g., 10% of snippets to fail to be indexed. At a bad time, it could cause 100% of a given project's database records to fail to be indexed, yet we'd consider the project to have been successfully indexed; and it's quite possible we've already seen this on production.\n\nWe have persistent status data for repositories, so there the impact is somewhat reduced - we can see that the repo hasn't been properly indexed, and so retry the operation at the sidekiq level. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIndex projects with lots and lots of parallelism. Observe many mysterious failures. \n\n`PersonalSnippet.es_import` in a rails console will return a number greater than 0, indicating some documents failed to index.\n\n`ElasticCommitIndexerWorker.new.perform` on certain projects (especially ones with a large number of documents) will cause later bulk requests to fail with output like:\n\n```\nFlushing error:  Failed to perform all operations\n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 4: failed to insert 2/2 documents \n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 5: failed to insert 6/6 documents \n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 6: failed to insert 1/1 documents \n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 7: failed to insert 2/2 documents \n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 8: failed to insert 1/1 documents \n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 9: failed to insert 1/1 documents \n2019/06/24 11:55:01 bulk request 10: failed to insert 1/1 documents \n```\n\nSince repository indexing is an all-or-nothing scenario, our sidekiq-level retries must redo the work that was in bulk requests 1-3 in this example.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nIn both cases, having some documents fail is an *expected* part of making bulk requests. We can get status information back listing exactly the documents that failed, and use that to retry the documents at the operation level before failing the whole operation.\n\nFor database content, we need to ensure that we *do* fail the operation. At present, we don't track database indexing status at all, meaning initial indexing can easily leave out some documents, causing search gaps. cc @phikai","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-24T13:01:47.536Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T14:58:11.633Z","closed_at":"2019-08-06T07:46:15.301Z","closed_by":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","advanced search","backend","devops::create","group::editor","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":693521,"iid":35,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/08/22/gitlab-12-2-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:48:32.567Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:20.799Z","due_date":"2019-08-22","start_date":"2019-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/35"},"assignees":[{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12372","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12372","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12372/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12372/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12372","relative":"#12372","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12372"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":153,"epic":{"id":274,"iid":153,"title":"Rollout Advanced Global Search  on GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/153","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 13, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":22186083,"iid":12362,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project imports unconditionally enqueue an `ElasticCommitIndexerWorker`","description":"### Summary\n\nSpotted while working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/800\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSet up an elasticsearch-enabled GitLab instance with the following settings:\n\n* `elasticsearch_indexing: true`\n* `elasticsearch_limit_indexing: true`\n* `ElasticsearchIndexed{Namespace,{Project}.count =\u003e 0`\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nEvery time a project is imported, an `ElasticCommitIndexerWorker` is unconditionally enqueued\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nSince we should be indexing zero projects with this setup, zero `ElasticCommitIndexerWorker` jobs should be enqueued.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe issue is here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/project_import_state.rb#L68\n\nWe need to check `project.use_elasticsearch?` before enqueuing the job.\n\nSince we check it inside `ElasticCommitIndexerWorker#perform`, this bug is *almost* free - it just creates a constant level of no-op sidekiq jobs that must be discarded.

and include into our [Go guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/go_guide/#go-standards-and-style-guidelines).\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- All Golang projects in [Security Products](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products) have their `golint` command fixed in their CI configs\n  - For analyzers - see the proposed approach [below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12340#note_192545198)\n- All linting issues in these projects are addressed\n- This fix is documented and presented across GitLab to avoid such hidden linter misbehavior on other Golang

it really clear how users can buy GitLab from the group billing page","description":"\u003c!-- \nPlease remove /confidential from the bottom if this issue can be made public.\n\nPlease complete the template below as best as you can. Make sure to check if this issue has already been raised by someone else first to avoid duplication. \n\nFor each section below, please add screenshots or links or anything that may help visual learners understand the problem better, even if this takes you an extra minute or two this is a great help to some folks.\n\nhttps://www.learning-styles-online.com/style/visual-spatial/\n\n--\u003e\n\n### Problem\n\nWhen you visit the group billing page whilst on the Free plan, there is nowhere to purchase GitLab.  You can click the `Free` link but that's not a clear pathway to purchase. You can only start a trial. This causes users to either have to visit the user settings billing page or find the pricing page on about.gitlab.com (or they might already know to go to the portal, but that's doubtful).\n\nI've created a [separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/1544) to discuss increasing visibility to buy GitLab on the homepage.\n\n![Screenshot_2019-06-21_at_6.11.14_PM](/uploads/9f9f074b949b3a173733fc4eeb20bb4f/Screenshot_2019-06-21_at_6.11.14_PM.png)\n\nWe should make it really easy for people to buy GitLab via this page and reach the checkout page in very few clicks. \n\n### Original Proposal\n\nCould we add a green CTA that simply says `Buy Now` that takes them to the pricing page either next to or instead of the `Start your Free Trial` CTA? I'm not sure what's the best user experience here. \n\n### Design Proposal\n\n| Upgrade (No Current Plan) | Upgrade (Active Current Plan) |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Group_Billing_-_Proposal_Free_Plan_2x](/uploads/5c5a814925c3615cd5b068d0d7358570/Group_Billing_-_Proposal_Free_Plan_2x.png) | ![Group_Billing_-_Proposal_Current_Plan_2x](/uploads/e1f805ad14154ccfac412a43e0371fa2/Group_Billing_-_Proposal_Current_Plan_2x.png) | \n\n**Upgrade (No Current Plan)**\u003cbr\u003e\nWe should create a **4 column Card component** layout to showcase Upgrade opportunities, displaying short, informative and easily digestible information. The Card would contain three top features, with a link to learn more about each Plan. This seems like a reasonable bitesize amount of information for our users to make an informed choice.\n\n**Upgrade (Active Current Plan)**\u003cbr\u003e\nIf a user is already on a Plan (i.e. Bronze) we should display the \"Active\" Plan with a disabled styling, including a note next to the Title with the text `Current Plan`. We should also disable the Upgrade Button.\n\n**URLs**\u003cbr\u003e\n* All of the `See All {Plan} features` links = https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/gitlab-com/feature-comparison/\n\n* Since downgrading is currently a manual process via support I've also included some text *\"Please contact Customer Support if you would like to downgrade your Plan.\"* to inform users of this process.

For the MVC, however, we limit the relationship only to parent-\u003echild, and disallow parent-\u003echild-\u003echild-\u003e(...). One level of relationship is good for many use cases, but in a more complex workflow you have pipeline branches creating one or maybe two pipeline branches of their own.\n\n### Intended users\n\nSoftware Developers\n\n### Further details\n\n- See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/22972 for details on parent/child implementation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove the limitation for child pipelines, and set a maximum depth for relationships. A decent starter value could be 5, but even 2 is better (that at least unlocks an alternative to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229134). If the max depth is reached, the pipeline should fail to start and return a failure status attribution, and there should be a clear message what happened.\n\nWe could implement this using [Gitlab::ObjectHierarchy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/60689fc347f768c6dde375565ea5e43dc574ea3f/lib/gitlab/object_hierarchy.rb) utility which is already used today for groups/sub-groups. This would allow us to find out all descendants or all ancestors as well as calculating the `max_descendants_dept` which should be used to enforce the limit.\n\n- change `Ci::Pipeline#same_family_pipeline_ids` to take in consideration a wider hierarchy\n- change `Ci::CreateCrossProjectPipelineService#ensure_preconditions!` to account for a wider hierarchy\n- ensure pipeline processing works as expected with status attribution\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nA maximum depth is important to prevent recursive/runaway pipelines causing a denial of service.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### Links /

Summary\n\nCorrect metrics report on merge request shows up from second refresh onwards.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n#### Example 1\n1. Have a merge request open with running pipeline that creates metrics report. Let the pipeline finish.\n   - Test summary report does get automatically refreshed when the pipeline continues. One would assume code quality report and metrics report to refresh too, but they do not.\n     ![1-autorefresh](/uploads/001254fd59b2da1a70ff4199a19b4ede/1-autorefresh.png)\n2. Refresh the merge request page (using cache override, for Firefox CTRL + SHIFT + R)\n   - Code quality report appears normally, metrics show **incorrectly** that nothing changed, but it doesn't show the *Expand* button to see it further, even though there *was* changes.\n     ![2-firstrefresh](/uploads/6592d4407cee0466ed9fb089057284c0/2-firstrefresh.png)\n3. Refresh the merge request page once more (again with cache override)\n   - Now metrics changes appear as they should have on the first step\n     ![3-secondrefresh](/uploads/ba44573644ced5252fff28fa24211ddc/3-secondrefresh.png)\n\n#### Example 2 (taken from #13015)\n1. Create a new repository that publishes a metric report that is gauranteed to change. For example, here is the `.gitlab-ci.yml` I was using to test this behavior:\n\n   ```yaml\n   create_metrics:\n     script:\n       - echo timestamp $(date +%s) \u003e metrics.txt\n     artifacts:\n       reports:\n         metrics: metrics.txt\n   ```\n\n1. Create a new merge request and navigate away from the merge request page.\n1. Once the pipeline has finished, navigate back to the merge request page.\n\nAt this point in time, the metrics widget will incorrectly show \"Metrics report did not change\".  Refreshing the page will cause the widget to update and correctly register a change to the metric.\n\nI'm not sure if this will be helpful, but here is the repository I was using to test this behavior: https://gitlab.com/nfriend/metrics-testing\n\n#### Example 3 (taken from #216352)\n\nOpen https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28407, wait for metrics report widget to be loaded the first time, then reload page.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n#### Example 1\nSee *Steps to reproduce*\n\n#### Example 2\n![2019-07-23_13.16.05](/uploads/e31c27a258b329d9431ade467836bab1/2019-07-23_13.16.05.gif)\n\n(The pause in the middle of the GIF is me hitting \u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e+\u003ckbd\u003eR\u003c/kbd\u003e to refresh the page.)\n\n#### Example 3\n![Metrics_report](/uploads/b11ee69b2878c7a5867e739eafaa1681/Metrics_report.mp4)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMetrics report (and code quality report) should autorefresh when pipelines are completed. Or at least metrics report shouldn't show incorrectly that \"nothing changed\" when the page is refreshed.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee *Steps to reproduce*\n\n### Output of checks\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nUsing gitlab-runner `11.11.2`, and self-hosted omnibus gitlab `11.11.1-ee`.

This is used in `EE::Namespace#beta_feature_available?`.\n\nThe problem is that now that we made the feature Generally Available, we've replaced our usage of `EE::Namespace#beta_feature_available?` with `EE::Namespace#feature_available?`, and this method has a different implementation:\n\n- It `return false unless ::Feature.enabled?(feature, default_enabled: true)`\n- But since we've enabled the feature for groups/projects and not globally on GitLab.com right now, this condition actually evaluates to `false`, meaning that `EE::Namespace#feature_available?` returns `false` for the groups/projects that we specifically enabled the `insights` feature flag for.\n\nThe easy fix for GitLab.com is to remove the feature flag value entirely (using the ChatOps or API) once it's deployed to production.\n\nA proper long-term fix would be to make `EE::Namespace#feature_available?` check for `::Feature.enabled?(feature, self, default_enabled: true)` in addition to `::Feature.enabled?(feature, default_enabled: true)`, i.e.\n\n```ruby\n    def feature_available?(feature)\n      # This feature might not be behind a feature flag at all, so default to true\n      return false unless ::Feature.enabled?(feature, default_enabled: true) || ::Feature.enabled?(feature, self, default_enabled: true)\n\n      available_features = strong_memoize(:feature_available) do\n        Hash.new do |h, f|\n          h[f] = load_feature_available(f)\n        end\n      end\n\n      available_features[feature]\n    end\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T13:51:14.523Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T02:07:24.268Z","closed_at":"2021-01-04T02:07:24.222Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","feature flag","priority::4","reproduced on GitLab.com","severity::4","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

to render a processed (merged) gitlab-ci.yml file via API","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWriting and debugging nested or complex pipelines is not a trivial task. Especially when working around limitations (or bugs) of advanced features (like include), the resulting pipeline could come handy for finding errors quicker.\n\n### Intended users\n\nDeveloper\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nBuild on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30066\n\n1. `YamlProcessor` to add to the `Result` object the merged YAML (result of `Ci::Config#expand_config`)\n1. in the CI Lint API: add a key `merged_config` to expose the merged YAML if API request specifies the param `include_merged_yaml=true`\n\nPossibly we also solve https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37915 with this change.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are three \"levels\" of processing that are possible:\n\n1. each `include` keyword is processed and the result merged with the main yaml\n1. each job using `.extends` is merged with the given extension\n1. the full data structure is being composed and validated recursively. If syntax/logical errors are found it returns the same data as (2). If it succeeds it will include a normalized list of jobs containing also all sensible defaults that GitLab applies. E.g. default `allow_failure: false` or `default:` specs copied in each job.\n\nThis feature will only go to level 1. Additional layers are possible in follow on issues, if needed.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nSecurity Risks:\n- If the merged .gitlab-ci.yml contains variables from this project or one of the included project they could leak. The pipeline should be rendered with the permissions of the user who is running the linter, and not giving them access to anything they wouldn't already have access to.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T09:44:02.514Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T15:34:55.151Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T20:43:52.052Z","closed_by":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","DEPRECATE_pipeline authoring","Deliverable","backend","customer","devops::verify","direction","group::pipeline authoring","missed-deliverable","missed:13.3","pipeline","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"}],"author":{"id":2802112,"username":"bene64","name":"Bene","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2802112/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bene64"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":20,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29568","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29568","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29568/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/29568/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#29568","relative":"#29568","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#29568"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":24698237,"iid":29553,"project_id":278964,"title":"Pipeline status of related merge request of issue is visible for non members despite settings","description":"**[HackerOne report #587945](https://hackerone.com/reports/587945)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-05-22, assigned to `jritchey`:\n\n### Summary\n\nHello,\n\nWith introduction of `https://about.gitlab.com/2019/05/22/gitlab-11-11-released/#more-details-for-related-merge-requests` , It is possible to see the pipeline status of merge requests associated with issues when we have below settings for the public projects\n\n![Screenshot_2019-05-23_at_00.17.09.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ac103f32-4b9e-4ae4-9436-6ab625adfece/Screenshot_2019-05-23_at_00.17.09.png)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

This issue may affect other types of dependency files - to be investigated.\n\nThe problem comes from the [Gemnasium analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) and is visible in the generated Dependency Scanning report it generates. It may impact gemnasium-python and gemnasium-maven as well.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a npm project with a `package-lock.json` file, and where the same package version appears multiple times in the dependency graph.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm/blob/master/qa/expect/gl-dependency-scanning-report.json#L11322-11333\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThis JSON object appears twice in the `dependencies` of `package-lock.json`:\n\n```json\n        {\n          \"package\": {\n            \"name\": \"yallist\"\n          },\n          \"version\": \"2.1.2\"\n        }\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`yallist@v2.1.2` should appear only once in the list.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nIn this particular case the root cause is the way the dependencies list is generated in the `npm` parser, to be fixed in [parser/npm/npm.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium/client/blob/1.0.1/parser/npm/npm.go#L57).\n\nThat being said, the problem may be generic and affects multiple parsers, in which case it's best to remove the dups when converting the dependencies returned by the parser, in [convert/convert.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/v2.2.1/convert/convert.go#L59).\n\n/cc

page not properly updating","description":"### Summary\n\nGroup Billing page on .com is not updating properly when users are given higher permissions than Guest at lower levels.  Customer is currently at the Gold level and Guest users should not be counted in the total.  However, if you promote a guest user to a different permission, the billing page is not updating properly.  \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\nA[\"Top Level Group\"] --- B[\"SubGroup1\"];\nA[\"Top Level Group\"] --- C[\"SubGroup2\"];\nC --- D[\"Project1\"]\n```\n\nIn the example above, imagine 8 users being added at the Top Level Group. 4 have guest access and 4 have owner access.  In that situation, in a Gold account, only 4 licenses should be counted.  If you then traverse down to SubGroup2 and promote one of those Guest users to \"Developer\", the Billing page should now reflect 5 seats in use.  It is not.  \n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCheck out the video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLvnrq0fILA\u0026t=4s . (GitLab Unfiltered link)\n\nTwo things to keep in mind for this situation:\n1. Customer is set up for Group SSO on .com\n2. Customer has a license applied.\n\nIn my testing on my own Gold Trial .com group, I was not able to reproduce this behavior.  However, I am not able to mimic those two scenarios above.\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis came from a customer. You can see it in the video.   \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nBilling page is not updated when a user at a SubGroup is promoted to a higher permission than Guest. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nBilling page should reflect the proper count of users","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-14T02:23:49.443Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T15:34:15.958Z","closed_at":"2020-07-14T02:21:43.619Z","closed_by":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"labels":["Cannot reproduce","Enterprise Edition","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","[deprecated] 🍎","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","devops::growth","missed-SLO","priority::2","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

If deploy boards are enabled, top-level environments (not review apps) will be shown as an accordion. When expanded, the deploy board is shown.\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrently, deploy boards are lacking a visual cue that ties them to the environment above. The only indicator is the down arrow. \n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-06-13_at_11.01.55_AM](/uploads/9bf0220d3dafbf89df3364bfde64da83/Screen_Shot_2019-06-13_at_11.01.55_AM.png)\n\nThis problem is exacerbated when there is a problem with the deploy board and a warning is shown.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-06-13_at_11.01.01_AM](/uploads/e257c6b81d3dd9d73e7f71c58fba05c5/Screen_Shot_2019-06-13_at_11.01.01_AM.png)\n\nWhen a user is viewing their environments, they should be able to quickly understand which deploy board is associated with which environment. When there is an issue with a board, it should be clear to the user which board is having the issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### Phase 1\n\nSmall UI tweaks to aid in creating a visual hierarchy. Such as increasing border size or adding box shadows to create an emphasis that a deploy board belongs to an environment. Adjusting the proximity and placement of UI elements. De-emphasizing less important visual cues. As there is currently no design to go off of, this will require ~UX collaboration.\n\n#### Phase 2\n\nOnce the [Pajamas Tree component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/tree/) is complete, revisit this issue and evaluate implementing the Environments Row and Deploy Board as a tree component.\n\n[Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/199097#note_287256331):\n\n![image](/uploads/3cf1dc69be41dc758af057941489cfdd/image.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-13T18:03:36.166Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T23:56:00.276Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T23:56:00.250Z","closed_by":{"id":9677998,"username":"cbalane","name":"Chris Balane","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9677998/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cbalane"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Enterprise Edition","UX","UX FY21-Q4","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","cicd::active","component:tree","devops::release","environments","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

If the merge request was canceled by the user we do not need to alert the user of this.\n\nThe merge author (triggerer of the merge) of the merge request should receive a TODO in that case.\n\nTODO:\n* Type: `Merge request`\n* Action: `Merge` (new)\n* Copy: `Removed from Merge Train \u003cMR ID\u003e \"[MR TITLE]\" at [NAME SPACE] · [TIME AGO]`\n* Example:\n\n| ScreenshotMockup (browser made) |\n|---------------------------------|\n| ![TODO_notification](/uploads/a09ec09a1ace4425a0f9ce1b3aee6d89/TODO_notification.png)|\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/13767/diffs#note_181000683\n\n\u003e Consider that:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. cancel as user action should not generate for example TODOs,\n\u003e 1. failure as an event of system failing to execute action should likely generate TODOs.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes: Required, there should be new unit test for every newly added logic accordingly\n* End-to-end test change: Required, this is a good candidate for a new E2E test, please see proposal [test case](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/927) for more details.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Follow ups\n\n- Additionally, notify the merge request author if it is not the same person as the merge author/triggerer (Potentially)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-13T13:25:04.661Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T17:15:17.667Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T23:04:16.029Z","closed_by":{"id":5709468,"username":"cheryl.li","name":"Cheryl Li","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709468/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cheryl.li"},"labels":["Category:Merge Trains","Enterprise Edition","MR-Improvements","Technical Writing","UI text","UX","UX debt","backend","devops::verify","direction","group::pipeline execution","quad-planning::complete-action","severity::2","tw::doing","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":84,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12136","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12136","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12136/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12136/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12136","relative":"#12136","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12136"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3776,"epic":{"id":75116,"iid":3776,"title":"Merge Request Constancy","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3776","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":24697969,"iid":29452,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove .no_timeout as a timeout option from GitalyClient","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe have a range of timeout values defined in [`GitalyClient`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/lib/gitlab/gitaly_client.rb).

PostgreSQL 10.0 upgrade for Geo","description":"With %\"12.0\" release, we shipped new PostgreSQL 10.0 that will be automatically upgraded. This automatic upgrade doesn’t handle Geo secondary nodes automatically (this is a limitation on how PostgreSQL upgrade process work). We need to validate our documentation has the correct documentation and covers the whole process. \nIdeally we should instruct our users to disable PostgreSQL 10.0 automatic upgrade to plan ahead when/how to rollout it when Geo is enabled.\nA simplified walkthrough of the upgrade to 12.0 with Geo would be: \n- Disable PostgreSQL automatic upgrade\n- Upgrade GitLab to 12.0\n- Schedule downtime on secondary nodes\n- Put secondary in maintenance mode (halt access)\n- Upgrade primary\n- Trigger postgresql upgrade on secondary\n- Backup/restore database from primary\n- Enable access again\n\n### Update\n\nThe 12.0 release will not impact Geo users as the auto upgrade will be skipped for both primary and secondary nodes. When the related issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/4309#note_181022415 is complete, we will need to verify and document the upgrade process. \n\n### Update (September 2019)\n\nWe have performed some upgrades ourselves that have not succeeded first time, and we have a few reports from customers that have struggled over these releases. We need to take a closer look at if there is a problem around this series of upgrades. \n\n1. Install 11.11 in an HA configuration\n1. Upgrade to 12.0\n1. Upgrade to 12.1\n\n### Update from 13 September 2019\nthe current state of the investigation is:\n\n1. There are issues when upgrading from 11.11.5 through to 12.1.8 using Geo for zero downtime upgrades\n1. There are issues when upgrading from 11.11.5 through to 12.1.8 using down time upgrades\n1. We don't know yet how HA upgrades behave but @mkozono will perform an upgrade soon.\n\nThe individual problems may be different bugs and a first next step is to try and pin those down.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-11T19:57:07.369Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T14:20:03.003Z","closed_at":"2019-09-23T14:19:48.952Z","closed_by":{"id":2722370,"username":"rnienaber","name":"Rachel Nienaber","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2722370/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rnienaber"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","Geo Administration","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","customer","devops::systems","documentation","group::geo","missed:12.1","priority::2","severity::2"],"milestone":{"id":731039,"iid":38,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/10/22/gitlab-12-4-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:41:53.212Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:43.889Z","due_date":"2019-10-17","start_date":"2019-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2293,"username":"brodock","name":"Gabriel Mazetto","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2293/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brodock"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":57,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12092","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12092","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12092/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12092/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12092","relative":"#12092","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12092"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1931,"epic":{"id":12422,"iid":1931,"title":"Geo Upgrade Demos","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1931","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":21827584,"iid":12101,"project_id":278964,"title":"Epic Ancestor Links link to Self vs. Ancestor Epic","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen clicking on the Ancestor Link from within an Epic it correctly displays the name of the Ancestor epic, but the link is pointed at the same page as the currently viewed Epic.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue -

When shipped (**target 15.7**), job variable expansion will be changed and handled as expected for variables of type = file. In summary, going forward, variables that reference/alias file variables are expanded to the file variable's file name/path *instead* of its value (i.e., the file's content).\n\nThis is a **breaking change** but does resolve a potential security issue as secrets may be leaked with the current bug.\n\n- The plan is to simply ship the MR with the fix. There is no option as mentioned in some of the threads below, for shipping this fix behind a feature flag, providing a warning to the users.\n\n- I will keep the option open to pull the ship date into 15.6, as there are solid reasons, as outlined below, to do so. But I do want to give other users and customers that have not been following this issue the opportunity to be made aware of this change as there is a likelihood that the fix does, in fact impact a current workflow.

$REF_FILE_VAR\n```\n\nwill result in the following **before** and **after** outputs:\n\n### Before\n```sh\n$ echo $A_FILE_VAR\n/builds/avonbertoldi/test-project.tmp/A_FILE_VAR\n$ cat $A_FILE_VAR\nthis is some super secret content\n$ echo $REF_FILE_VAR\nthis is some super secret content\n$ cat $REF_FILE_VAR\ncat: can't open 'this': No such file or directory\ncat: can't open 'is': No such file or

Projects having a `Pipfile.lock` are not supported, even though they are easier to process (no need to fetch the Python packages, no need to install system libraries).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\nAs of [LicenseFinder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) v5.11.1, Python support is limited to Pip. It's implemented in the [Pip::PackageManager](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/package_managers/pip.rb) class and relies on the [license_finder_pip.py](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/bin/license_finder_pip.py) Python script to fetch and install the Python packages (which is not reliable and will fail if the system dependencies are not satisfied). `Pip::PackageManager` processes the output of `license_finder_pip.py`, builds a list of dependencies, and queries pypi.org to get metadata (named `spec`) on these packages. See [`pypi_def`](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/package_managers/pip.rb#L20). `Pip::PackageManager` returns an array of [PipPackage::Package](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/packages/pip_package.rb#L25).\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd `Pipfile.lock` support to [LicenseFinder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder). Ideally this would be contributed back to the upstream project, but we may need a temporary solution if the pull requests is not quickly merged into the [LicenseFinder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) repo. For instance, we may overload [LicenseFinder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) in [license-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-management) until `Pipfile.lock` support is merged.\n\nPipfile.lock may reuse part of the code used to implement [pip support](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/package_managers/pip.rb) but it will be significantly different because there's no need to call a Python script to fetch, install, and list the Python packages. The implementation would mostly parse a JSON document, like the code used to provide [npm support](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/packages/npm_package.rb).\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- Update [LicenseFinder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder)\n  - Extract generic code from [Pip::PackageManager](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/package_managers/pip.rb#L20), and make `pypi_def` method reusable\n  - Extract generic code from [PipPackage::Package](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/v5.11.1/lib/license_finder/packages/pip_package.rb#L25) (class method `license_names_from_spec`) or possibly rename class to something more generic\n  - Create new package manager class for Pipfile.lock support\n  - Create or reuse package class\n- Update [license-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-management)\n  - Update CI config and add QA job to test with a project having a `Pipfile.lock`\n  - Release new version\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change.\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdate [license-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/license-management) documentation.\n\n### Testing\n\n- Rspec specs, similar to what already exists in License Finder\n- QA job using a test project having `Pipfile.lock`\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nLicenses successfully reported for Python projects with a `Pipfile.lock`, even when system dependencies are not satisfied by the `license-management` Docker image.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6783\n\n### Product\n- Release Post - Not Needed","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-06T16:14:18.523Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T17:27:38.439Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T17:27:38.380Z","closed_by":{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Enterprise Edition","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":971158,"username":"xlgmokha","name":"mo khan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cc8d289bc1a24067f9af4f92452f4fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xlgmokha"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12012","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12012","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12012/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/12012/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12012","relative":"#12012","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#12012"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1401,"epic":{"id":7869,"iid":1401,"title":"Improve License Compliance support for Python","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1401","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24697474,"iid":29295,"project_id":278964,"title":"Time tracked info are different during right side open and collapsed","description":"Steps to reproduce\n\n1. go to any issue page\n1. let's say total time logged in that issue is 3h 45m (not in multiple of hours but have some minutes) \n1. then when the right side bar is open everything is well\n1. but when collapsed and we move mouse over to time tracked/logged section it shows only *Time spent: 3h / --* in tooltip in desktop computer instead of `3h 45m`.

SAST reports logic for the Merge Request widget to the backend","description":"The security request reports on the merge request widget currently use the generated artifacts to generate SAST reports on the frontend. \nWe should move this logic into the backend, and provide final results to the frontend, like [junit reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee//ci/junit_test_reports.html) do.\n\nThis will improve performances of page load and will allow more flexibility.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should compare the SAST reports in the backend and expose the result to frontend, using a ready to use and common json entity. Such [entities already exist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/ee/app/serializers/vulnerabilities/occurrence_entity.rb) as part of the Group Security Dashboard and should be reused to provide the same structure everywhere and allow frontend to reuse standard components.\n\nThis API should then be consumed by the frontend and the older artifacts code should be moved behind a feature flag so we can revert back to using it if we need to.\n\n* [x]  Frontend #13647 /

behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current

One way of doing is by handling data size as follows;\n\nImagine an `Epic A` has 500 direct child items (both Epics and Issues combined), and one of the child epic `Epic Child C` has further 300 items. Then a possible approach to handle this situation can be as follows;\n\n*  We load only 50 children of `Epic A` on page load.\n    *  Once user scrolls to bottom of the tree, we load next 50 children.\n*  In case user tries of expand child epic `Epic Child C` (which is direct child of `Epic A`), we show only first 50 items.\n    *  At the end of these 50 items, we show a placeholder link which says; `Open 'Epic Child C' to show all children`.\n\n### We have already implemented this UX in Group Dashboard (where max count is
