If for example user wants to create a second, private fork of an already forked project, this is not possible via the GUI. API allows for this customization, but the same workflow cannot be achieved via the GUI.\n\n## Proposal\n\nProvide a mechanism to change the initial name of a fork before the fork operations is performed. If the chosen name exists in the target namespace then disallow forking (existing behavior).\n\n![image](/uploads/c4449d39e5d6b961e9259f8fca905032/image.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eMore mocks\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n| Desktop | Tablet | Mobile |\n|---|---|---|\n| ![gitlab.com-projects-new__1_](/uploads/44a9a3312c09a80444e6c3cc0a3ab1bb/gitlab.com-projects-new__1_.png) | ![gitlab.com-projects-new](/uploads/998115ee57b01234dc5d66acb154f5ef/gitlab.com-projects-new.png) | ![gitlab.com-projects-new__2_](/uploads/e39e9f662de5de54d0bf58645da9de50/gitlab.com-projects-new__2_.png) |\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nExample: as a regular contributor to an open source project like `gitlab-org/gitlab-ce`, I have a public fork `john/gitlab-ce` from which I contribute improvements. Sometimes I want to work from a private fork `john/private-ce` when I need to fix a security issue and I can't work on it publicly. Or I might just be nervous about having my really bad WIP branches being public.\n\nCurrently this is possible using the API, or via an inconvenient workflow involving forking to a group, renaming and moving to my own namespace.\n\nStreamlining the security release process for public projects is the primary motivation for making this easy. A developer who is going to resolve a confidential security issue, needs to be able to create a branch in a private fork. If a public fork already exists, this workflow is obstructed.\n\nAnother common use case is a template project that I want to create forks from, so that I can merge changes between projects since they are related.\n\n### Testing\n\nThere are existing QA tests that will be updated: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/1719\n\n### Links / references\n\n* MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53544\n* Docs MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56461\n\n### Release notes\n\nDescription: Forking a project allows you to have an exact copy of an original repository where you can experiment, apply changes, and submit contributions to the parent project. When forking it's useful to provide forks a meaningful name that indicates the effort or goal related to it. Additionally, having multiple copies of a fork allows you to maintain diverging projects.\n\nThis release introduces the option to edit the project name and project slug when forking, as well as the possibility of having multiple forks of the same project, allowing for different names and different forks in a single namespace.\n\nDocs: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork\n\n![fork-form](/uploads/d37f013dfb077a3a884c6729571fb41d/fork-form.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-05T09:37:46.450Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T20:23:31.167Z","closed_at":"2021-04-21T18:40:39.970Z","closed_by":{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","GitLab Core","Technical Writing","UX","backend","backend-weight::1","customer","devops::create","direction","documentation","forking","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::source code","missed-deliverable","missed:13.11","missed:13.9","release post item","release post item::in review","repository","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":154467,"username":"MeirionHughes","name":"Meirion Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8f1eb245b51b1c7c89b1812a60a23e6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeirionHughes"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":115,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":126,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15013","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15013","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15013/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15013/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#15013","relative":"#15013","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#15013"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1421,"epic":{"id":8068,"iid":1421,"title":"⑂ Forking Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1421","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e day remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24636831,"iid":15012,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add line numbering and permalink to each line in job log","description":"This idea has been brought out https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/7141#note_3547401 for the first time, by @jonathon-reinhart.\n\nI think that is a good idea to introduce such feature as it would be easier then to share links pointing directly to problematic lines in build traces with other team members.

Something like: `Filtering by both author and message is not supported at the moment.`\n\n### Future steps\n\nOnce the `author AND message` filtering is unblocked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/2431 we should create the necessary issues to solve the BE and FE in an upcoming milestone.\n\n### Links\n\nhttps://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commits?author=rymai\n\n### Customers  \nhttps://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000YTQ6w  \n","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-27T05:26:55.905Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T23:44:17.759Z","closed_at":"2020-04-15T05:35:22.877Z","closed_by":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"labels":["Category:Gitaly","Deliverable","UX","coach will finish","customer","customer success","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","movingtogitlab","priority::4","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item","repository","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":2167502,"username":"robotmay_gitlab","name":"Robert May","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2167502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/robotmay_gitlab"},{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":258543,"username":"voarsh","name":"Reese Jenner","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/173d11c5fdd7650e54930233f93614a1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/voarsh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":68,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":178,"downvotes":1,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14984","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14984","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14984/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14984/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#14984","relative":"#14984","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#14984"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":1068078,"iid":208,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow admins to disable \"social\" accounts unlink feature","description":"- Zendesk ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/14828\r\n\r\n### Requested feature\r\n\r\nSome enterprises would like to just allow one way to sign into their GitLab servers, and the tendency has been to use SAML for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBut, since SAML is considered a \"social\" provider, a user can easily unlink it from their profile settings.

This was added in Issue gitlab-ce#2494 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24196. Would it be possible to extend this to support using `[TOC]` to add a Table of Contents as well? As noted in the forum thread below, some Markdown editors such as stackedit.io and Typora interpret `[TOC]` as a ToC rather than `[[_TOC_]]`. I also have my repository's wiki mirrored on Bitbucket and I found that their software also recognises `[TOC]` but not `[[_TOC_]]`.

This causes issue when you make changes to one, but someone pushes a change to the same file before you were able to push your changes. You end up with an unmergeable situation.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, we propose to implement file locking. File locking allows you to prevent other people from modifying one of multiple files, while still allowing you to push changes. This prevents situations where files become unmergeable.\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\n\r\nAnyone using binary files in their repository can use this. For instance, game developers are likely to have many unmergeable files in their repositories like PSD's, images, 3d models, etc. They would greatly benefit from this feature.\r\n\r\nAs the use of LFS increases, people are more likely to have binary files in their repositories, increasing the odds someone will use this feature.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nIf we add the `project.path_locked?(path)` check into `Gitlab::GitAccess`, it will automatically apply to web edits, git pushes and LFS pushes. \r\n\r\nSo this feature entails:\r\n\r\n- Adding model for locked files or directories\r\n- Adding \"Lock\"/\"Unlock\" button in UI. A locked file or directory can only be unlocked by the lock user or a project master\r\n- Disable edit, replace, delete, new file buttons with a tooltip as appropriate\r\n- Show lock icon by any locked file/dir with a tooltip on that lock icon with text like \"Locked by Douwe Maan 5 minutes ago\"\r\n- Add page to list all locked files/dirs to get overview in case people forget to unlock\r\n- Add `path_locked?` check en error message in `Gitlab::GitAccess`\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [Git LFS feature proposal for File locking on GitHub](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/pull/666/files)\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\nThis feature needs to be build, put on the website, added to sales software, taught to sales. It will require more than release to do that, I expect.\r\n\r\n- [ ] build feature as EE option\r\n- [ ] make sure we can generate licenses for this\r\n- [ ] sync with sales and marketing on release, pricing, etc https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/498","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-13T10:16:32.345Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T04:49:26.363Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","UX","direction","repository"],"milestone":{"id":47832,"iid":12,"project_id":278964,"title":"8.9","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-03-04T13:38:40.555Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T17:33:39.655Z","due_date":"2016-06-22","start_date":null,"expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":55219,"username":"kelvinmutuma","name":"Kelvin Mutuma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/55219/kev.jpeg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kelvinmutuma"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":6,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/497","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/497","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/497/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/497/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#497","relative":"#497","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#497"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":1022141,"iid":186,"project_id":278964,"title":"fix issue weight overflow","description":"- original issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4227\r\n\r\n![image](/uploads/857f3797ee65d8bb7b5fe9b2f9cf4382/image.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-12T13:51:05.493Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T16:01:33.265Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","frontend","issues"],"milestone":{"id":47832,"iid":12,"project_id":278964,"title":"8.9","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-03-04T13:38:40.555Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T17:33:39.655Z","due_date":"2016-06-22","start_date":null,"expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5497,"username":"JobV","name":"Job van der Voort","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e1e9ffdda52d8c519ac5c49929d7dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JobV"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/186","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/186","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/186/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/186/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#186","relative":"#186","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#186"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10880217,"iid":6062,"project_id":278964,"title":"Testing for multiple browsers using Selenium","description":"The job of this feature is to implement cross browser testing with Selenium. \n\nWe will use browserstack too do the actual selenium testing as it is the easiest to automate. \n\n1.

To still be able to use git easily as a team, but not run the risk of accidentally making changes on a branch you shouldn't, you can use protected branches.\n\nHowever, manually changing every branch to protected can be a lot of work and prevents automation and quick shipping, while maintaining this security. Therefore we want to be able to \n\n1. Automatically protect branches based on certain wildcards \n1. Restrict push access to these branches for specific people (groups or single users)\n\n## old proposal\n\nThe ability to create rules for protecting branches (1) and to restrict push access to certain people (2).\n\nA rule should consist of one or two things:\n\n1. A rule based on when a branch should be protected: `production/*` or `production` or `production/the-real-thing`. This should allow for `*` wildcards or just a branch name. Other examples: `*-stable`, `*-stable`. Restrict wildcard use to edges if necessary.\n1. A user or group. If none is used, normal rules for protected branches are applied. If a user or group is added, pushing should ONLY be allowed by these people. This can be anyone*.\n\n### When setting a rule for a group\n\n- any group can be set\n- the group should automatically have this project shared with it (using the 'share with group' feature)\n- should be communicated in the UI\n\n### When setting a rule for a person\n\n- the person should be added to the project with master level access\n- this should be communicated in the UI \n\n## old issue\n\nSomething like:\n- allow wildcard for protected branches\n- allow per-user permission to protected branches.\n- some other feature\nSo people who used protected branches feature in CE can continue use it in EE but with more flexibility.\n\nZendesk issue: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/13653 and https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/19387\n\nGerrit allows per branch permissions. The customer uses this feature but would like to switch entirely to GitLab. They use a similar release branching strategy to GitLab. Each release has a release manager, or release team, that is responsible for that release branch going forward. Patches should only be approved by the release team so they want the ability to set these permissions on a branch directly. \n\ncc/ @JobV @dzaporozhets @sytses","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-07T14:34:22.589Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T13:54:52.511Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","customer","direction","frontend","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":107989,"iid":18,"project_id":278964,"title":"8.14","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-28T14:48:37.247Z","updated_at":"2016-12-27T12:39:35.765Z","due_date":"2016-11-22","start_date":null,"expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/18"},"assignees":[{"id":5497,"username":"JobV","name":"Job van der Voort","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e1e9ffdda52d8c519ac5c49929d7dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JobV"}],"author":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5497,"username":"JobV","name":"Job van der Voort","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e1e9ffdda52d8c519ac5c49929d7dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JobV"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2017-03-09","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/179","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":5},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/179","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/179/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/179/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#179","relative":"#179","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#179"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":997392,"iid":174,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add better LDAP connection handling","description":"Zendesk issue: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/13591\r\n(But many more customer LDAP issues would be helped with this)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have some connection handling so if the first query times out or is otherwise unsuccessful we build a new adapter and try again. \r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if we make sure that the DNS is re-queried.

This is his reasoning:\n\n\u003e From previous experience with Redmine, it is extremely helpful to be able to take a list of issues and export them to PDF or CSV. This allows the list to be used for many different purposes. For example, one of our projects has weekly user stand-ups and it would be nice to export and send or email this week's list of top issues for discussion.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [ ] Add an export button at the top of the issue list, as seen on the design below\n- [ ] A modal appears saying that we will prepare the CSV and send it by email (default primary email)\n- [ ] The export format is CSV\n- [ ] The export contains all the issues based on the current selected filters \n- [ ] Send the email containing the CSV\n- [ ] Restrict the Download button to project members\n- [ ] Make sure the job that creates the CSV and does not kill production db\n\n###

commits when merging merge request","description":"### Resources\nPM @victorwu | BE @smcgivern | UX @pedroms | FE @mikegreiling\n\n---\n\n### Problem\nSimilar to #895 and explained in #411, we would like to reduce the friction in getting code merged into a master / main development branch for typical development scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n* For all merge request methods (`merge commit`, `merge commit with semi-linear history`, `fast-forward merge`), allow the user to squash all the commits and merge in one action.\n* Squash is a checkbox, like the remove source branch checkbox, that is available on MR creation/edition, or when the accept button is visible, and it can be changed by anyone who can accept the MR or the MR author.\n  * This checkbox is always shown on create and edit.\n  * This checkbox is only shown when accepting if there is more than one commit in the MR - otherwise, there's nothing to squash.\n* We will never update the source branch with the squash result, just the target branch.\n* For the different merge methods:\n  * Merge commit - we squash the commits in the MR based on the base SHA (the common ancestor between source and target), then merge that commit into the target branch as normal.\n  * Merge commit with semi-linear history - we do the same, but the rebase start point is the start SHA (the current target branch HEAD).\n  * Fast-forward merge - we also rebase to the start SHA, but then we just fast-forward that commit onto the target branch.\n* We should always squash before rebasing, because then we know that the resultant squashed commit can be either merged or rebased cleanly based on our existing checks.\n* This applies to automatic merges as well. When a user sets a merge to be automatically attempted after the pipeline succeeds, it is as if they execute this one action of rebase+merge.\n\n#### Designs\n\n| New/edit MR | View MR (desktop) | View MR (tablet) | View MR (mobile) | \n|---|---|---|---|\n|![new-edit](/uploads/c631daef4d8fe9927648b78b32239522/new-edit.png)| ![image](/uploads/2acc0fd42d256bd797275b92a5aef678/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/263d6989face63870672eec1ce3d6b9d/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/576a0570b7a6ecd63c6d808f8ecfcd35/image.png) |\n\nIn the **New/edit MR** screen, the “Learn more” links to the documentation.\n\nIn the **View MR** screen, the :grey_question: question icon should have a ~~“Learn more”~~ tooltip and link to the documentation.

Highlight lines spanned by each comment","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nAfter the first iteration of adding basic UI via Dropdowns on MR Comments, it's not very clear what's the interval of lines spanned by each comment.\n\nWe should highlight the intervals upon hover and when focusing on/authoring one comment.\n\n## Implementation details / Rollout plan\n\n- **Attention:** need to test the themes properly.\n- **Note:** we can use an element with `pointer-events: none;` using `rgba()` as background color.\n- **Note:** while leaving the comment, they’ll be highlighted. Clicking/hovering on a comment, highlights too. Blurring the comment, will turn off the highlights.\n- **Is blocked by:** Refactoring of Diff lines using non-table markup (issue to be added) \n  - Includes: Comment bubble will be shown/hidden via CSS\n\n## Further details\n\nCommenting on multiple lines does increase the complexity of performing a code review because it changes the decision making process for each discussion.\n\n- Currently, a user need only decide which line is most relevant, click and add their comment.\n- Multiline commenting, instead, requires a user to decide if this should be a single/multiline comment, then decide where to start of the range, and then the end of the range, and finally add their comment.\n\nThe question is, what percent of the time is a multi line comment preferable, and for that benefit is the increased complexity worth it?\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eHistoric discussions\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nSome questions posed by Douwe earlier, with answers:\n\n1. How do we select that? Click 3, drag and hold until 8? What happens if someone wants a bigger range that doesn't fit inside the viewport?\n  1. Click and drag. We shouldn't encourage selecting entire files, so whatever we get when we implement this (be that, you can't do it, or the viewport slowly scrolls down, as happens with selections)\n1. How do we display what lines a specific discussion applies to?\n  1. State explicitly and show the range up to X lines\n1. Can people comment on a range that spans a collapsed region? \n  1. Yes, I think this should be possible (another issue relates to this)\n1. Can people comment on intersecting ranges? (3-8 and 6-12)? How would they specify their range? How do we display that?\n  1. Maybe for the first iteration not? In general I think this is easy to represent in the db, just hard in the interface. \n1. Can people comment on a line inside a range that has a discussion? How do we allow that to be created? How do we display that?\n  1. Ideally yes, same as previous question. Otherwise skip for first iteration. Depends on UX more than anything.\n1. Can people comment on the last line of a range that has a discussion? How do we allow that to be created? How do we display that?\n1. What happens if someone adds a line in the middle of the range. Does the discussion become outdated, or remain active?\n1. What happens if someone removes a line in the middle of the range. Does the discussion become outdated, or remain active?\n1. What happens if someone changes a line in the middle of the range. Does the discussion become outdated, or remain active?\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Selecting a range\n\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211255\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218319\n\n### Visualizing the range, and overlapping ranges (this issue)\n\n1. Highlight line range when writing a comment/reply\n   1. While the comment text is focused, the range to which it applies is highlighted.\n1. **Can be done in separate iteration**: Highlight line range when hovering a published/pending comment\n   1. Hovering over a discussion thread shows the range to which it applies. Hovering over a line of code does not trigger a highlight event as there may be multiple matching comments.\n\n| Hover a comment to see selection range | Overlapping comment ranges |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Artboard_20190607_120213-1](/uploads/caa50ead8f58b2e88bcec572adb5beb8/Artboard_20190607_120213-1.png) | ![Artboard_20190607_120046](/uploads/8f09c9895afc1703ece2213162ea67ac/Artboard_20190607_120046.png) |\n\n### Marking discussions outdated\n\nAll discussions relating to a line that is changed are marked out of date.\n\nWe should measure the number of overlapping discussions with ~\"telemetry 🔮\" and consider revising this behavior in the future.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n* As in [the MVC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211255), no risk to availability is expected, but we should check how the feature performs on large diffs with many comments.\n* However, this change comes with considerable risk to user satisfaction should anything go wrong, given the popularity of this feature and the heavy use of comments in merge requests.\n  * That risk can be mitigated through extensive new unit and integration coverage to cover known troublesome edge cases. Particularly interactions with expanding lines and changes to lines before, after, within, and spanning the commented range. Feature tests may be required given the nature of the UI actions involved.\n  * Although selecting over collapsed regions is optional for this iteration, we'll need to confirm that attempting to do so doesn't cause problems.\n* No need for a new E2E test (and isn't recommended given the complexity of the UI interaction), and the change isn't expected to affect existing E2E tests.\n\n## Links / references\n\nInterested customers ([CARR/IACV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNnd99OOVVApW7UBaAmNsaMz2XkVlWqlDPQj1nqleqc/edit)):\n\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000AYw26\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000fyZHW\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001hH3boQAC\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001PrBWK\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001Eo2H5\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000004bZKw\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000005cxCt\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000017upDb\n- https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001beDS0","state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-17T11:25:54.953Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T02:16:57.837Z","closed_at":"2020-07-20T10:31:46.354Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","UX","backend-weight::1","customer","customer+","devops::create","direction","frontend","frontend-weight::8","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","quad-planning::complete-action","replacing-gerrit","shortlist","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":55219,"username":"kelvinmutuma","name":"Kelvin Mutuma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/55219/kev.jpeg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kelvinmutuma"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":86,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":178,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14128","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14128","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14128/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14128/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#14128","relative":"#14128","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#14128"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1431,"epic":{"id":8117,"iid":1431,"title":"💬 Comment on multiple lines in a merge request diff","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1431","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":855428,"iid":121,"project_id":278964,"title":"Retrieve audit events via API: MVC","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nOrganizations need assurance that users of GitLab are in compliance with policies they've set on the instance.

This leads to a scattershot approach adding tests that may not actually improve the quality of the overall project.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) who will be creating and reviewing merge requests and has been asked to hold/improve the code coverage with each change.\n\n### Further details\n\nTo help developers see what parts of the code can be immediately improved it would be nice to have a visual representation in the diff showing where test coverage is lacking.\n\nThis would be really nice but hard to do cross-programming languages.\n\n- Phabricator does it for PHP https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist_coverage/\n- Atlassian does it for Java https://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/overview\n- Code Climate does it in GitHub https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate\n\nThis could be shown in the Changes / Diff view this way along with Code Quality data.\n\n![image](/uploads/6039a83fecb217e628e139eb7db23d19/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nUse [Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) to create a code coverage report on a project. On a pipeline run create utilize this visualize changes to code coverage as shown in the [Designs tab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/3708/designs).\n\nThis can be built on top of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/23694\n\nAdditional community contributions are welcome to build support for additional coverage formats.\n    \nCode Quality data as shown in the original mockup will be incorporated in a [follow-up issue gitlab#2526](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/2526).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Document how to add the new job to the gitlab-ci.yml file\n* Document how the code coverage information will be displayed\n* Document how others can contribute additional coverage support for this feature similar to how the Package team has done this for [registry contributions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/#suggested-contributions).\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n* Test for a very large code coverage file to measure performance\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nThis issue will be successful if \u003e= 25% of Projects have included this job in their pipeline within 90 days of launch.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n* A pipeline that includes the new job will at the same speed as before the job was added\n* A merge request that includes changes to a source file includes the code coverage visualization in the diff view\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nThis will be available in the Core product as the primary user is an IC.\n\n### Links / references\n\n/label

We generate a private key and display the public part to the user so they can copy and paste it onto their server, or into GitLab as a deploy key for the source project.\n* `known_hosts` management:\n    * Should be invisible for non-SSH URLs\n    * When we setup SSH (which can be password or pubkey-auth-based), we need to detect the host keys and present their fingerprints to the user to confirm that they're valid.\n    * When we edit SSH setup, we also need to re-trigger the verification\n    * Advanced users may want to enter known_hosts data directly. They should be able to click a button to get a `\u003ctextarea\u003e` they can input directly into, rather than using automatic detection\n    * Who verified the host keys (i.e., submitted the form), and when, should be displayed for audit purposes.\n\n### Design\n\n| Password authentication | SSH public key authentication |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ![mirror-repository--ssh-01](/uploads/a12cdf720488f47b4c5c91efabb4af7b/mirror-repository--ssh-01.png) | ![mirror-repository--ssh-02](/uploads/542bd7bdbdd238760524cc0386a2421e/mirror-repository--ssh-02.png) |\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-02T14:11:17.131Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T18:56:41.168Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T21:05:00.120Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","backend","customer","customer+","frontend","priority::2","severity::2","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":315838,"iid":27,"project_id":278964,"title":"9.5","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-05-17T16:56:47.199Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T17:29:38.556Z","due_date":"2017-08-22","start_date":"2017-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/27"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":113,"merge_requests_count":3,"upvotes":28,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/98","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/98","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/98/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/98/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#98","relative":"#98","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#98"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":1369498,"iid":408,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rebase MR prior to approval.","description":"* Zendesk ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/12951  \n* GitLab Version: 8.2.1\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA MR that requires rebasing is first approved and then rebased.\n\n### Observed Behavior\n\nA MR approval that leads to a rebase onto master changes the MR and \nrequires a re-approval of the MR. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

You can start a review, add a comment to a review, discard a review, and finish/submit a review.\n\nThe review feature is **only available** in merge requests, when [creating a discussion from a code line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/e4a4c31fffc4ab091deed0d21f645e6d/image.png), or [replying to a discussion](/uploads/eaa75a59b550a1919508074cb1b1c9af/image.png) (from a code line or from the “Discussion” tab) — **it is not available** when adding a comment/discussion in the “Discussion” tab.\n\nOne of the main changes is replacing the “Comment” and “Comment and resolve discussion” buttons with: a new “Start a review” button; a “Add comment now” button (same function as the current “Comment” button); and a “Resolve discussion” checkbox.\n\nHere's the flow with notes:\n\n| 1) Disabled | 2) Enabled | 3) Pending comment | 4) Adding more comments | Discard review |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| \u003cdetails\u003eAt first, both submit buttons are disabled as there is no content. The “Cancel” button function is unchanged. The “Resolve discussion” checkbox is unselected by default and its label changes to “Unresolve discussion” if applicable.\u003c/details\u003e | \u003cdetails\u003eWhen inserting content, buttons become enabled. The \u003ckbd\u003eCMD + ENTER\u003c/kbd\u003e keyboard shortcut activates “Add comment now”.\u003c/details\u003e | \u003cdetails\u003eAfter pressing “Start a review” or “Add to review” (visible in step 4), the comment is now in “Pending” state and indicates what will happen to the discussion (e.g. “Discussion stays resolved”). Users can edit the pending comment or delete it. A fixed panel slides in from the bottom of the screen, allowing users to “Submit review” or “Discard review” — this panel stays visible until the user submits or deletes/discards every pending comment. Users can still add single comments right away (“Add comment now”).\u003c/details\u003e | \u003cdetails\u003eFor the following comments, the “Start a review” button changes to “Add to review”. Users can always “Add comment now” for submitting single comments, even after _starting a review_.\u003c/details\u003e | \u003cdetails\u003eIf there are pending comments: an alert reminds users that they will lose their comments.\u003c/details\u003e |\n| ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/ac2fd8ede61ca5cddb44fd436ddb6f28/image.png) |

http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/doc_styleguide.html#location-and-naming-of-documents\n\nAfter a call with Drew, we decided it would be best to have as few top level\ndirectories as possible (dirs right under `doc/`).\n\nWith that in mind, we decided to use the following names and hierarchy:\n\n| Directory | What belongs here |\n| --------- | -------------- |\n| user | User related stuff. Anything that can be done within the GitLab UI goes here including admin/ |\n| administration  | Stuff that require access to the server where GitLab is installed |\n| api | API stuff |\n| development | Stuff related to the development of GitLab. Any styleguides should go here. |\n| legal | Legal stuff about GitLab |\n| install| Probably the most visited directory, since `installation.md` is there. Ideally this should go under `administration/`, but it's best to leave it as-is in order to avoid confusion (still debated though)|\n| update| Same with `doc/install/`. Should be under `doc/administration/`, but this is a well known location, better leave as-is, at least for now. |\n\n**General rules:**\n\n1. The correct naming and location of a new document, is a combination\n   of the relative URL of the document in question and the GitLab Map design\n   that is used for UX purposes ([source][graffle], [image][gitlab-map]).\n1. When creating a new document and it has more than one word in its name,\n   make sure to use underscores instead of spaces or dashes (`-`). For example,\n   a proper naming would be `import_projects_from_github.md`. The same rule\n   applies to images.\n1. There are four main directories, `user`, `administration`, `api` and `development`.\n1. The `doc/user/` directory has five main subdirectories: `project/`, `group/`,\n   `profile/`, `dashboard/` and `admin_area/`.\n   1. `doc/user/project/` should contain all project related documentation.\n   1. `doc/user/group/` should contain all group related documentation.\n   1. `doc/user/profile/` should contain all profile related documentation.\n      Every page you would navigate under `/profile` should have its own document,\n      i.e. `account.md`, `applications.md`, `emails.md`, etc.\n   1. `doc/user/dashboard/` should contain all dashboard related documentation.\n   1. `doc/user/admin_area/` should contain all admin related documentation\n      describing what can be achieved by accessing GitLab's admin interface\n      (_not to be confused with `doc/administration` where server access is\n      required_).\n      1. Every category under `/admin/application_settings` should have its\n         own document located at `doc/user/admin_area/settings/`. For example,\n         the **Visibility and Access Controls** category should have a document\n         located at `doc/user/admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md`.\n\n[graffle]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/d8d39f4a87b90fb9ae89ca12dc565347b4900d5e/production/resources/gitlab-map.graffle\n[gitlab-map]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/raw/master/production/resources/gitlab-map.png\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [x] Create guidelines where to store documentation for new features https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5641/diffs\n- [x] Create `user/` which will have two big categories: `projects/` and `groups/` where we put project and group related documentation respectively.\n- [ ] Gradually move `workflow/*` under `user/`. Some documents in `workflow/` belong to `administration/` like `workflow/lfs/lfs_administration.md` (guideline MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4624)\n- [ ]  Merge `doc/ci` to the rest of the docs https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20168\n- [ ] Move `security` under `administration`.\n- [ ] Move `integration` under `administration`.\n\n## Questions\n\n- What happens if a feature is in both projects and groups?\n\n## Advantages\n\n1. Clear hierarchy. Right now workflow is getting a big pile of everything.\n1. We will be able to have meaningful URLs like\n`doc.gitlab.com/user/projects/merge_requests.html`. With this you immediately\nknow that you are navigating a user related documentation concerning projects\nthat is about merge requests.\nAnother example: `doc.gitlab.com/administration/incoming_email/postfix.html`.\nYou immediately know that it's related to administration stuff and is about\nthe incoming email feature and especially postfix.\n1. Ability to check of missing docs. Since the path of docs will following a pattern, we will be able to know what is missing. Not the most accurate way to test this, but useful for a big percentage.\n\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n~~Links pointing straight to the repo will break.~~ Nothing will break, we will keep\nthe existing docs for as long as we can, and we will just change their contents just pointing\nto the new locations (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4624)\n\n~~In docs.gitlab.com we will use redirects https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/doc-gitlab-com/issues/64~~\nWe will eventually migrate the doc website to GitLab Pages, so this should be avoided.\n\n---\n\nI think it's worth it if we want to establish a default documentation\nhierarchy. We can make use of the social media to notify people about this and\nplan ahead.\n\n~~My main concern is the `install/` dir which according to the plan should be\nmoved under `administration/`.
