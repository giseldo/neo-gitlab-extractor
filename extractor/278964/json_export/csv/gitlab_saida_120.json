As mentioned above, we get the `issueLinks` with their `state` and `webUrl` already, so I believe this could be adding the `gl-tooltip` directive to the new column in the first part\n- [x] ~frontend ensure these changes are progogated to all security dashboards  \n  -

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nRight now, if you want to avoid running one particular SAST analyzer, you need to remove it from the long string of analyzers [found here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/390afc431e7ce1ac253b35beb39f19e49c746bff/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L12) and use that to set the `SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` somewhere in your project's CI template. And, if you do this, it excludes you from future new analyzers. This gotcha is not obvious.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nIt should be easier for a user to avoid running a particular analyzer without the risk of losing out on getting to use newly added analyzers.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWe could add a `SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` variable which would define the analyzers that the user wants to avoid running.\n\nProposed Removal in %14.0\n\n### Implementation plan\nPhase I (to be done with this issue)\n* update [SAST vendored template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) to add backward compatible support for SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS\n* deprecation notice for SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS\n* update documentation to add SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS\n* [SAST Config UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#configure-sast-in-the-ui) update to support both variables - should not require frontend changes, and only impact on customers should be removal of SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS and addition of SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS in their .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nPhase II (to be done in [follow-up issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290777))\n* update [SAST vendored template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) to remove support for SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS and break backward compatible\n* update QA to not rely on SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS (CI configuration of the analyzer projects, [shared CI config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/analyzer.yml))\n* [SAST Config UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#configure-sast-in-the-ui) update to support SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS only and ignore SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS\n* update documentation\n\n### Further details\n\nTake a look at [this Merge Request ](https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman/a_rails/-/merge_requests/25)for a proof of concept.\n\n### Limitations\n\n~~The current proposal would only work with Docker in Docker disabled, which is currently the default and will be the only way to run SAST in the near future.~~\n\nDocker in Docker is no longer supported, so the above is no longer a problem.\n\n### Risks\n\nRemoving/renaming `SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` could have unintended consequences. Removing it would break QA is it works right now.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document.

Plan TMAU\n\n## Goal\n\nTrack user interactions with issues within the usage ping so that we can calculate Monthly Active Users (MAU) for Plan. It is important that we have an accurate reflect of MAU as it is one of the primary metrics that GitLab leadership uses to [make informed investment decisions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/investment/) across the product.\n\n## Project Management MAU Definition\n\nThe sum of all unique users that took an action within an Issue over a given period of time.  \n\n## Proposal\n\nImplement a counter in the usage ping that aggregates the total count of unique users that took an action on an issue.\n\nBased on this conversation (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4291#note_365848816), it appears as though most events can be tracked via:\n\n- `system_note_metadata`\n- `resource_milestone_events`\n- `resource_state_events`\n- `resource_weight_events`\n\nRecord the aggregate unique MAU counts under `issue_events` in the usage ping.\n \n## Events To Aggregate In Usage Ping\n\n**Question:** Do these actions include issue created?

Summary\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.\n--\u003e\n\nCalling `WikiPage#last_version` triggers a Gitaly call to fetch commits, it's supposed to only load the latest commit but due to a bug in `gollum-lib` we end up loading up to 30 commits.\n\n## Improvements\n\n\u003c!--\nExplain the benefits of refactoring this code.\nSee also https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\nChange the logic in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gollum-lib/blob/55872cddca5ef135874036ce2e1f062682c7b931/lib/gollum-lib/pagination.rb#L34 to respect the `per_page` option when it's lower than the default.\n\nAlso see upstream for reference where this was fixed: https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/blob/ab3f01c4c009fff85dfc7076171e32378d5b1197/lib/gollum-lib/pagination.rb#L32-L39\n\n## Involved components\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n- `gollum-lib`: for the actual fix\n- `gitaly-ruby`: to bump the version for `gollum-lib`\n- `gitlab`: to bump the Gitaly version and remove the workaround at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/149d907ccda80cf5b81c26bdcb6a928ee43d890a/lib/gitlab/git/wiki.rb#L129\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\nThis should reduce the overall latency for the `#show` and `#pages` actions:\n\n-

should also reduce the overall latency for `WikiGetPageVersions` calls, though this also includes other calls that specify a higher limit (used e.g. in the `/history` view):\n\n-

The `canRemove` prop is passed from the [`RelatedIssuesList` component](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/061a44941f0d271d425d0c1331874dbc12dbff55/ee/app/assets/javascripts/related_issues/components/related_issues_list.vue#L135-135), and passes its own `canAdmin` prop. In other words, either all the items can be removed, or none of them can be. There's no way to individually pick which items are removable or not. We need to add in this functionality. We also need to add the ability to show a custom tooltip.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nThe component tree looks like this:\n\n```\nRelatedIssuesRoot\n| -\u003e RelatedIssuesBlock\n  | -\u003e RelatedIssuesList\n    | -\u003e RelatedIssuableItem (multiple)\n```\n\n1. Modify [`RelatedIssuesRoot`](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/061a44941f0d271d425d0c1331874dbc12dbff55/ee/app/assets/javascripts/related_issues/components/related_issues_root.vue) and [`RelatedIssuesStore`](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/061a44941f0d271d425d0c1331874dbc12dbff55/ee/app/assets/javascripts/related_issues/stores/related_issues_store.js) so that the related issues have two new properties, `actionIcon` and `actionTooltip`, where `actionIcon` is the name of the icon to show (if any) and `actionTooltip` is the tooltip to show on hover.\n\n1. Modify `RelatedIssuesBlock` to [not pass down `canAdmin` to `RelatedIssuesList`](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/061a44941f0d271d425d0c1331874dbc12dbff55/ee/app/assets/javascripts/related_issues/components/related_issues_block.vue#L198-198).\n\n1. Modify [`RelatedIssuesList`](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/061a44941f0d271d425d0c1331874dbc12dbff55/ee/app/assets/javascripts/related_issues/components/related_issues_list.vue#L127-127) and remove the `canAdmin` property altogether, since it no longer needs to be passed down to `RelatedIssuableItem`.\n\n1.

Description\n\nImplement the `License-Check` and `Vulnerability-Check` rows to show in the unconfigured state, and the configured state (same as unconfigured but show 'Enable' button)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] Create generic `unconfigured_approval_rule' component in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/approvals/`\n\nIt should also have a prop to show/hide the \"Enable\" button. prop for tooltip links, prop for description text, should emit an event for the `Enable` button click event.\n\n- [x] Create wrapper `unconfigured_approval_rules` component that iterates for `License-Check` and `Vulnerability-Check` using `unconfigured_approval_rule` component in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/approvals/`\n\n- [x] At the bottom of the `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/approvals/approvals_list.vue` add ``unconfigured_approval_rules` component to bottom of template\n\n- [x]

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe CI Lint currently uses `YamlProcessor` to validate the content passed in. The `YamlProcessor` represents a small part of the whole pipeline creation process and it only covers syntax errors. Using `YamlProcessor` today it gives a false sense of validation to users because it can return that a configuration is valid but when trying to create a pipeline it fails for some other reasons not considered before. Typical examples are logical validations that occur beyond the `YamlProcessor`.\n\nExample: The following syntax is considered valid by CI Lint but it would return an error `test: needs 'build'` when trying to actually create the pipeline.\n\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  script: echo\n  stage: build\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID'\ntest:\n  script: echo\n  stage: test\n  needs: [build]\n```\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \nImproved understanding of errors at lint-time.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\nWe will introduce a new mode in `Ci::CreatePipelineService` called `dry_run: true` (which is `false` by default). This mode would skip persisting the pipeline while letting everything else happening. In the end, a non-persisted pipeline is returned including any errors and (recently added) warnings.\n\nThen we change the Lint controller to use `Ci::CreatePipelineService` with `dry_run: true` and pass in the content to validate.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate?

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes - Yes, please add unit tests along with new/updated logics\n* Integration test changes - not required\n* End-to-end test change - not required\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

This is scheduled to be run automatically in a near-milestone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223621.\n\nWhen run, it allows a project to reduce their recorded LFS usage quota to take into account any files that have been deleted. It also sets up `RemoveUnreferencedLfsObjectsWorker` to later actually delete the files.\n\n### Problems\n\n#### The task only runs on the main project repository\n\nCurrently, `OrphanLfsFileReferences`, the class that handles the task, will only clean up orphaned LFS Files within [the main project repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9afbf5d1227f303d0616090a33701b6d344ac138/lib/gitlab/cleanup/orphan_lfs_file_references.rb#L45), and is unaware of other repositories, like the design repository, which also stores files with Git LFS. \n\n#### The task contains a bug that might break designs\n\nIn the situation where a file has been added to an LFS-enabled project repository and also to the same project's design repository, and then deleted from the project repository, `OrphanLfsFileReferences` will currently cause the project to lose its ability to lookup the design which will render the design file as permanently broken.\n\nThis happens due to the [scoping of the `LfsObjectsProject` records to be deleted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9afbf5d1227f303d0616090a33701b6d344ac138/lib/gitlab/cleanup/orphan_lfs_file_references.rb#L28), which currently does not pay attention to selecting the `LfsObjectsProject` [by `repository_type`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9afbf5d1227f303d0616090a33701b6d344ac138/app/models/lfs_objects_project.rb#L15-19). \n\nIn the above scenario, the class will also destroy the `LfsObjectsProject` where `repository_type` is `:design` in addition to the one where `repository_type` is `:project`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMake `OrphanLfsFileReferences` work for all repositories that `LfsObjectsProject` [knows of](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9afbf5d1227f303d0616090a33701b6d344ac138/app/models/lfs_objects_project.rb#L15-19).\n\nPay attention when scoping which `LfsObjectsProject` records to destroy, and scope by the relevant `repository_type`. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: At time of writing `repository_type` is nullable. A null `repository_type` value is considered to mean `:project`. The scoping will need to take into account this.**\n\n## Backlog Refinement by @alexkalderimis:\n\n**Documentation needed:**\n\nNone needed in addition to what we currently have.\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**\n\nUnit tests for `orphan_lfs_file_references.rb`, parameterized by `repository_type`.\n\nE2E Scenario tests that verify that this task never makes design files\nunavailable.\n\n**Security Tests Planned:**\n\nNone\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**\n\nThe proposed method in the description sounds excellent.\n\n**MR Breakdown:**\n\n* Add scopes for the different `repository_type`s, paying attention to the\n  meaning of `null`.\n* Use these scope in `OrphanLfsFileReferences`\n \n**Weight Estimate:**  2-3\n\n---\n\n## Backlog Refinement by @.Luke:\n\n**Documentation needed:**  \n\nNone. The [existing docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/cleanup.html#remove-unreferenced-lfs-files) should be enough.\n\n**Test Activity Planned:** \n\nUnit tests of `OrphanLfsFileReferences`.\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:** \n\nFollow the **Proposal** in this issue's description. \n\nWe may want to change `OrphanLfsFileReferences` to iterate over each repository type and effectively call `remove_orphan_references` three times, passing in repository details. We may want to think about adding some small classes to help.\n\n**MR Breakdown:** \n\n1 MR\n \n**Weight Estimate:** \n\n2\n\n---\n## Backlog Refinement by @toupeira:\n\n**Documentation needed:**  None\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**  Add tests around the new behaviour, and the current bug.\n\n**Security Tests Planned:**  None\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:** The proposal sounds solid!\n\n**MR Breakdown:** 1 MR\n\n**Weight Estimate:**  2-3 (1 extra point for unfamiliarity with LFS)\n\n~\"Backlog Refinement::Knowledge\" \n---","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-17T02:14:15.925Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:57:32.306Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T09:51:10.785Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::plan","group::product planning","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

As issues are moving through a workflow within a swimlane, the user should be able to move an issue to another list to reflects this (IE from `Planning breakdown` to `In dev`). \n\n\u003e When conducting Product Increment or Sprint planning, my team needs to convert prioritized initiatives and their business objectives into estimate-able work items to be delivered, so that we can sequence work according to available capacity and relative ROI.\n\n\u003e When reporting status, I need to be able to ensure my status is accurate, current, and quantifiable so I can maintain a high level of trust with stakeholders.\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe board is a SSOT that reflects the status of issues which builds trust with the team and stakeholders.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIssue cards should retain the same information/look as issue cards on current boards and should interact in the same way (move from list to list *within a swimlane*).\n\n### Further details\n\nMoving issues into a new swimlane/epic will be worked on separately in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218164\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Specifically, if you are viewing analytics for a group that contains subgroups, data for projects within those subgroups does not load. \n\nAll descendent projects *are* selectable from the dropdown, but when selected, show the message `There is no data available. Please change your selection.` Data from nested descendant projects is included at the group level, just not when looking at the projects themselves.\n\nThis was reported by a customer here: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/163688 (internal only)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI've created an [example group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/prod-analytics-bug-repro) with the following group structure:\n\n```\nProd Analytics Bug Repro (This is the root group)\n| - Top Level Project\n| - Subgroup A\n    | - Project A\n    | - Subgroup B\n        | - Project B\n```\n\nIn each project, I've created 2 merge requests, one has been merged and one has not.\n\nTo see this in action, go to the example group `Prod Analytics Bug Repro` and view the Productivity Analytics page. \n\nThe first view will correctly show metrics for the group and all its descendants - there should be 3 MRs, which are shown as expected. You can also select the direct child project, `Top Level Project`, and its metrics will show correctly as well.\n\nWhen you try to view `Project A` or `Project B`, the graph shows up empty and displays the message `There is no data available. Please change your selection.`\n\nI've included screenshots further down.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/prod-analytics-bug-repro\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nProjects nested in subgroups do not properly return data when viewed from productivity analytics at the group level.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nProjects nested in subgroups should properly return data when viewed from productivity analytics at the group level.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n#### Group level productivity analytics\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.08.34_PM](/uploads/40499234a6059bf0695a603b319c5cc1/Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.08.34_PM.png)\n\n#### Group level productivity analytics - direct child project \n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.08.47_PM](/uploads/c0504e1fe971bd06f2e30aef0948df89/Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.08.47_PM.png)\n\n#### Group level productivity analytics - nested descendant projects\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.08.59_PM](/uploads/15143a5af31b20c4d7703126cc9c1ab0/Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.08.59_PM.png)\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.09.11_PM](/uploads/336e1701ef44382612f4f2a448912bad/Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.09.11_PM.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI haven't looked too deeply into the code responsible, but this is probably the root of the problem: when selecting one of these nested projects, I see several requests return 404 in the network tab. They have query parameters like this:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.20.37_PM](/uploads/8f43b33b2c1b1d2432dda434e3c0b5cf/Screen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_5.20.37_PM.png)\n\nBased on `group_id:

(which I believe is what's used in the query parameters that return not found), each dropdown item should provide its own group ID to be used in the API request when it's selected.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-16T22:42:57.546Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T08:48:20.808Z","closed_at":"2022-03-29T07:24:46.297Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam

We provide many security scanners as part of our Secure offering. We also encourage 3rd party vendors to integrate their scanning tools using our open API and data interchange formats. A benefit of using GitLab is managing vulnerabilities from multiple scanners in a unified experience. While you were already able to filter by scanner type (SAST, DAST), it wasn't possible to drill down by tool provider.\n\nYou now have even more granularity when managing vulnerabilities with the new ability to filter by scanner and vendor. This will make it even easier to narrow focus to one set of scan results. You can also look at all results across a single vendor's scanners. The new filtering capability is available now in Project Vulnerability Reports.\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#vulnerability-report\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThere tends to be some confusion when talking about the particular terms related to scanning tools and technologies. This is compounded by differences in terms used internally (as in both at GitLab and in the code) and external (as in the GitLab product UI and the wider security industry). To help clarify the ask, here are how terms used in this issue should be taken:\n\n1. Scanner - How we refer generically to a particular scanning technology, e.g. `SAST` or `Dependency Scanning`  in the UI (these are the values that currently appear in the Vulnerability Report's `Scanner` filter and column). Technically, these are report types.\n1. Report Type - The Common Security Report schemas, one for each type of scanning technology (SAST, DAST, Dependency)\n1. Vendor - The name of the company or organization responsible for providing a particular scanner tool. This will either be GitLab for the Secure scanners we provide or the name of a 3rd party vendor for integrated scanners. All 3rd party tools will correspond to a Report Type.\n1. Analyzer - The specific tool name provided as a scanner. For example, Brakeman is an analyzer that provides SAST scanning. Right now, we do not expose the analyzer name in the UI, preferring to use the generic scanner name only (`SAST` in this example).\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis piece was split from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210327\n\nUpdate the `Scanner` filter on the vulnerability list to:\n* group all Secure scanners under a `GitLab` vendor heading\n* dynamically add headings for any other vendor that has been configured on the project and\n   * add beneath each header filters for each scanner provided for each respective vendor\n   * 3rd-party scanners should match GitLab scanner names (SAST, DAST, etc.) for consistency\n   * selecting a 3rd-party scanner filters for only vulnerabilities found by that specific scanner. In other words, if I have selected the filter for a 3rd-party SAST scanner but not selected GitLab's SAST scanner, I would only see results detected by the 3rd-party.

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/36981#note_380887643): \n\n    \u003e **suggestion (non-blocking)**: I think `isChecking` is a better name than `isMarking`, but the problem with this is that this value is ultimately coming from [`app/assets/javascripts/gl_dropdown.js#L382`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.1.4-ee/app/assets/javascripts/gl_dropdown.js#L382), and it's called `isMarking` there.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e This area of the codebase is remarkably convoluted, and I wonder if it's better to keep the names consistent for the same value as it passes from file to file.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e So, my suggestion is to rename `isChecking` *back* to `isMarking`, so it's easier to grep the codebase for it.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e WDYT?\n\n- [ ] @markrian started a

project\u0026.issues\u0026.maximum(:iid) )\n   (1.0ms)  SELECT MAX(\"issues\".\"iid\") FROM \"issues\" WHERE \"issues\".\"project_id\" = 22\n   (0.2ms)  BEGIN\n  InternalId Load (1.3ms)  SELECT \"internal_ids\".* FROM \"internal_ids\" WHERE \"internal_ids\".\"project_id\" = 22 AND \"internal_ids\".\"usage\" = 0 LIMIT 1\n  InternalId Load (0.5ms)  SELECT \"internal_ids\".* FROM \"internal_ids\" WHERE \"internal_ids\".\"id\" = 97 LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE\n  InternalId Update (0.5ms)  UPDATE \"internal_ids\" SET \"last_value\" = 1701 WHERE \"internal_ids\".\"id\" = 97\n   (0.4ms)  COMMIT\n```\n- or try to allocate iids to cover the size of the issues to be imported I guess with something along the lines:\n\n```ruby\ncurrent_iid = InternalId.generate_next(project, {project: project}, :issues, project\u0026.issues\u0026.maximum(:iid) )\nlast_iid = InternalId.track_greatest(project, { project: project }, :issues, current_iid + issues.size, project\u0026.issues\u0026.maximum(:iid) )\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-16T17:07:41.291Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T20:01:00.601Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T12:37:06.659Z","closed_by":{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan

Update StoreReportsService and make new fingerprint default fingerprint. \n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. [x] Add conditional index to container scanning vulnerabilities. \n2. [x] Migrate all existing container scanning vulnerabilities in the DB to use the above value\n    - [x] Loop through each entry in the `vulnerability_occurrences` table and copy the `docker_image_without_tag` and `package_name` from the `raw_metadata` column, and insert it into the `location_fingerprint` column\n3. [x] Update [StoreReportsService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215466) make new fingerprint default fingerprint.\n4. [x] Manually test to ensure multiple Docker images can be scanned with the same vulnerability and they show up as separate vulnerabilities\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_375762618\n\nAlso, the documentation to offline environments should be updated, and give instructions to set up a proxy to serve the distro packages.

This addition to the pipeline is to be used by ~\"Category:SAST\" and ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\" analyzers.\n\n### Intended users\n\nTo be used by developers of the Secure analyzer projects.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDefine a stage and a job template to build distro packages, and a job template to release them. Also, define conventions on how to use them.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] [review the `stages`](#note_383115282), and define a stage where distro packages are build https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/134\n- [ ] decide how distro packages are stored https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233175\n- [ ] define a [job template to build distro packages](#note_383148478), and expose them as artifact\n- [ ] define a job template to release distro packages\n- [ ] illustrate how to use these in the context of an analyzer project that builds a distro package, builds a Docker image using that package, and release distro packages; the package is released with a version that matches the git tag, and released against as a major version, similar to the way Docker images are currently released\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214697#note_377749600\n\n### Further details\n\nThe stage where distro packages are built needs to be before the existing [`build` stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/7e7dd770e3f0ecf7ab856cf088759ac4f5c19d94/includes-dev/analyzer.yml#L11), which is currently used to build Docker images.\n\nThe job templates to release the distro packages is going to be similar to the existing [`.docker_tag` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/7e7dd770e3f0ecf7ab856cf088759ac4f5c19d94/includes-dev/analyzer.yml#L171).\n\nAs of today none of the analyzer projects override the `build commit` job defined in the `build` stage. Also, none of the analyzers redefines the pipelines `stages`. The `gemnasium-maven` analyzer uses the predefined `.pre` stage to check its Shell scripts.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe shared CI config is not documented, but we should improve this, and at least add code comments to cover the stages.\n\n- [ ] document the `stages` using code comments in the CI config file\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThe new CI config needs to be tested in the context of an analyzer project. Tests should cover the master branch, some feature branch, and git tags. This needs to be tested in the context of a fork of an official analyzer project.\n\n- [ ] test pipeline for master branch\n- [ ] test pipeline for feature branch\n- [ ] test pipeline for git tag\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nN/A\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nTo be used by all ~\"devops::secure\" analyzers using the [shared CI configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/master/includes-dev/analyzer.yml). This includes ~\"Category:SAST\", ~\"Category:Dependency Scanning\", ~\"Category:Secret Detection\", and ~\"Category:Container Scanning\".\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-16T14:54:42.778Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T22:03:41.631Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T22:03:41.618Z","closed_by":{"id":5292351,"username":"sam.white","name":"Sam White","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d467fb024d1858d279e6a36e028436ac?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sam.white"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:SAST","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","blocked","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:13.3","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
