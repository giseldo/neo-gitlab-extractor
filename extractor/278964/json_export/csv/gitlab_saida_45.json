Order by commit first\n2. Then alphanumeric by file name\n\nSo to set this up, you need multiple commits.\n\n1. Create a commit editing a file like `zoo.txt`\n2. Push it to the MR\n3. Create a new commit editing a file like `animals.txt`\n4. Push it to the MR\n5. ~~Make sure you have [Diffs Virtual Scrolling Enabled](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/880383fd67644a187c84f78b784745ea40a9d276/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/store/getters.js#L178-191)~~ Virtual Scrolling is enabled by default. Please ensure you [have not manually disabled it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/bac75056f26b3bd011731444360c622e39115d6d/app/assets/javascripts/diffs/store/getters.js#L177-179), and are not viewing the MR in single-file mode.\n5. Leave a comment on both files. You can start at the top and work your way down, but it doesn't matter what order you actually leave the comments in.\n6. Based on the UI display of the files, you should see the comment on `zoo.txt` first when you click the `Jump To Next` button, then the comment on `animals.txt`\n7. You are actually jumped to the `animals.txt` comment first, then looped back around to the `zoo.txt` comment.\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis happens in any project.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe code to sort the discussions is sorting first by filename, then by line number.\n\nThis doesn't match the way the files are displayed in the UI.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe order of the discussions to jump through should match the order they appear on the screen.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe code that sorts the discussions is [in the Notes app Vuex getters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/eff83fc9e9e07e93e51a99aab4babcf469d75f0d/app/assets/javascripts/notes/stores/getters.js#L182-204). I think it's _likely_ (but not guaranteed) that we'll need to coordinate this sorting algorithm with the UI display that orders the files differently.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-28T14:33:11.276Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T12:00:24.846Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T21:22:42.267Z","closed_by":{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas

pipelines) with [image integration tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330093) (using rspec and all running in the same `image test` job).\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1. Use [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/merge_requests/90/) as a starting point.\n1.

the sub-directory name is `test_project_name/test_case_name`, and the default test case is \"main\"\n   - add an RSpec example to the `spec/image_spec.rb` file that replicates what's tested in the downstream pipeline\n   - make sure that the new RSpec examples are executed when running the `image test` job\n   - remove the downstream pipeline from the CI config\n\nAlso, we'll need to make sure to keep at least one job integration test, to check the Dependency Scanning template.\n\nImage integration tests are implemented using the [integration-test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test) project. See gemnasium's [spec/image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/9ce00d783cac7a74957329b99514413cf30a35dd/spec/image_spec.rb).\n\n## Improvements\n\n- Image integration tests can run locally.\n- They are easier to maintained, compared to job integration tests using external test projects.\n- They run faster because there's no need to spin off a new job for each test case.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe might miss a case where the job definition can't be ignored. For instance, the image test might not set all the environment variables set in the scanning job. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330093#optional-missing-test-coverage.\n\nIt might take longer to execute the pipeline if too many long-running tests are combined in a single `image test` job. This might be a problem in the case of gemnasium-maven, gemnasium-python and retire.js because they build the project.\n\nThere might be leftover when building a project during the test, with possible side-effects. That's because the `DockerRunner` of the [integration-test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test) reuses the fixtures directory. TODO: create an issue about cleaning up the fixtures directory after running an RSpec group, or to make the runner copy the fixture to a temporary directory every time it runs.\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\nSee [improvements](#improvements)\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\nSee [risks](#risks)\n\n## Testing\n\nThe integration tests provide coverage.

check whether the job integration test is strictly needed\n   - if not, copy the files from the test project to the [`qa/fixtures` directory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/tree/master/qa/fixtures) of `gemnasium`; the sub-directory name is `test_project_name/test_case_name`, and the default test case is \"main\"\n   - add an RSpec example that replicates what's tested in the downstream pipeline\n   - make sure that the new RSpec examples are executed when running the `image test` job\n   - remove the downstream pipeline from the CI config\n\nNote that many of the above tests have already been migrated to the `gemnasium` [image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/fe797b9/spec/image_spec.rb#L1-1) as part of [Image integration tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/194)\n\nAlso, we'll need to make sure to keep at least one job integration test, to check the Dependency Scanning template.\n\nImage integration tests are implemented using the [integration-test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test) project. See gemnasium's [spec/image_spec.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/9ce00d783cac7a74957329b99514413cf30a35dd/spec/image_spec.rb).\n\n## Improvements\n\n- Image integration tests can run locally.\n- They are easier to maintained, compared to job integration tests using external test projects.\n- They run faster because there's no need to spin off a new job for each test case.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe integration tests provide coverage. SET may need to refactor, replace or remove the Test Orchestrator.\n\n## Outcome\n\nAll the job integration tests have been converted to image integration tests, except these:\n- [js-npm-offline-qa](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/fe797b9/.gitlab-ci.yml#L123-130), because extra setup is required to test the analyzer in offline environments. This is doable though.\n- [js-yarn-ds-remediate-top-level-qa](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/fe797b9/.gitlab-ci.yml#L140-147) because auto remediation only works in git repositories, but the image integration test directly mounts the directory of the test project, and it's not a git repo. Technically it can be converted to an image test, but extra setup is required. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/254#note_782984303\n\nIt was decided to keep at least one job integration test, to make sure that the job definition is compatible with the Docker image. In particular, the job integration test checks these parameters:\n- `script`\n- `artifact`\n\nHowever, it was decided that it was not necessary to have one job integration test per supported file/package manager because:\n- The `rules` parameter of the scanning job is already tested in the specs for the CI templates. See [dependency_scanning_gitlab_ci_yaml_spec.rb](/ee/spec/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/dependency_scanning_gitlab_ci_yaml_spec.rb#L89).\n- The Secure Test Project Orchestrator is still in place, and it will catch a regression that specifically affects one supported package manager.\n\nSee [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/254#note_777959740) in the MR.\n\nUnlike job integration tests, image integration tests don't check the execution time of the analyzer. This shouldn't be a concern though, because:\n- The `gemnasium` analyzer doesn't build anything, and the scanning time should always be the same, except for the time it takes to parse a lock file.\n- There's now a timeout for the `image test` job, ensuring that sum of all scanning times doesn't change much. Right now the timeout is 5 minutes, and it takes about 3 min 30 secs to run the job.\n- We still have at least one job integration test.\n\nSee

Currently, projects that are pending deletion are still displayed in some places, which is not desirable behavior.\n\n## Proposal\n\nProjects pending deletion should be excluded/hidden everywhere except the [Deleted Projects page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/#deleted-projects):\n\n- [ ] Homepage\n  - [ ] Your projects (Paginated list)\n  - [ ] Starred projects (Paginated list)\n  - [ ] Explore projects (Paginated list)\n  - [ ] Explore topics\n  - [ ] \"Filter by name\" feature\n- [ ] Group homepage\n   - [ ] Paginated list\n   - [ ] \"Search by name\" feature\n   - [ ] Archived projects tab (`https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroup_name\u003e/-/archived`)\n- [ ] \"Move issue\" feature\n- [ ] User Homepage\n  - [ ] Starred projects (`https://gitlab.com/users/\u003cusername\u003e/starred`)\n  - [ ] Contributed projects (`https://gitlab.com/users/\u003cusername\u003e/contributed`)\n  - [ ] Overview tab\n  - [ ] Activity tab (`https://gitlab.com/users/\u003cusername\u003e/activity`)\n- [ ] Visiting the deleted project's URL itself. It shows a warning \"Deletion pending. This project will be deleted on \u003cYYY-MM-DD\u003e. Repository and other project resources are read-only.\"\n- [ ] Projects marked for deletion are accessible via APIs\n  - [ ] https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/:id\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. On the homepage by default don't display the projects that are pending deletion and ~~it's handled via [`without_deleted: true`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/dashboard/projects_controller.rb#L68-69) param which in turn uses the scope [`where(pending_delete: false)`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d84494fd34fde7a2dc56a4cc814158177107efff/app/models/project.rb#L503) and therefore doesn't list those projects which are pending deletion.~~ it's handled via the [`set_non_archived_param` filter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a216d3a8573593894f077add83d44fd03f7ec3f0/app/controllers/dashboard/projects_controller.rb#L12)\n2. We know that once a project is marked for deletion we also set the field `archived` as true for that project and therefore it is not visible at a lot of places like \"Move issue\" feature, group issue list etc. For these the current logic will still work and we don't need to modify the queries as there is no way for the user to include the archived projects here unlike the homepage where they can view the archived projects as well if selected.\n2. The pending deletion projects are still be accessible on the homepage if we choose to display the archived projects from the top right menu and therefore to remove them completely we'll have to remove them from the query itself.\n3. As part of the implementation we need to do the following:\n   1. We need to create an index for the `scope :not_aimed_for_deletion, -\u003e { where(marked_for_deletion_at: nil) }`\n   2. Use the above scope in the `users_controller` and the `dashboard/projects_controller` so that we don't return the projects that are marked for deletion.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-27T16:51:05.109Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:20:08.326Z","closed_at":"2022-01-28T09:46:23.558Z","closed_by":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa

I'll still take a peek at the Backend but only after I'm done with the Frontend ones.\n\nSo, **as a multidiciplinary code reviewer**, I'd like to** be able to filter files** and only show the ones I care about, so I can **more efficiently navigate back and forth between the files relevant to my review**.\n\n### Details\n\nI wouldn't expect these to stick between page loads. Especially since making it stick could lead me to ignore filtered out files by accident. Explicit filtering ftw!\n\n### Proposal\n\nRegarding the UI proposal, it seems that the `Search` input is already a filter by itself:\n\n| Empty state | With search |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/cab10ea9d18aa61ee861c0e05c0a2ece/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/8d52e92e2458f205f2928d7b84ab93e6/image.png) |\n\nIt might be worthwhile to increase the visibility of that feature by giving users some hints.\n\nRegarding filtering by multiple file extensions it might be worth [extending the current Search functionality to support multiple comma-separated search queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343985#note_994735335). Also, it would be nice to support [a Glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) there.\n\nAdding suggestions to the Search panel could also speed things up by re-using user's previous searches.\n\n![image](/uploads/8b2f62deaac2e1f317fb96edb6989c26/image.png)\n\nWe can go even further with that and allow saving those queries for an even quicker access.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-27T13:05:32.874Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T12:01:29.634Z","closed_at":"2022-07-01T21:07:04.971Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","Technical Writing","UX","devops::create","documentation","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343985","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343985","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343985/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343985/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343985","relative":"#343985","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343985"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5092,"epic":{"id":164784,"iid":5092,"title":"Merge Request Exclusions for more efficient reviews","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5092","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96229382,"iid":343966,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Enable IaC Scanning configuration via MR","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the ability to configure IaC Scanning via a Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6655) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `configure_iac_scanning_via_mr` feature flag.\n\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::static analysis\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_secure-static-analysis`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @pgascouvaillancourt @rossfuhrman \n- PM: @tmccaslin \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe IaC Scanning analyzer will be configurable via an MR through the Security Configuration page.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nN/A\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nN/A\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-27T08:28:31.148Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T03:22:33.723Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T19:29:18.585Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["Category:SAST","SAST: Common Need","SAST: New Scanner","Stretch","backend","devops::secure","feature flag","frontend","group::static analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"}],"author":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343966","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343966","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343966/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343966/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343966","relative":"#343966","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343966"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6655,"epic":{"id":338515,"iid":6655,"title":"Enable IaC security scanning as an opt-in decision","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6655","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":96223152,"iid":343960,"project_id":278964,"title":"Guide for Product and Engineers for updating a metric definition","description":"# Summary\n\nBuild a guide on how to update a Service ping metric definition YAML file\n\n# What should be in the guide?\n\n- screenshots to explain the steps\n- what fields we allow to be updated. what fields should not be updated?

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 38e34090ed9b4e942d7dc58ff40ef7e331c698f4`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6346) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `cluster_vulnerabilities`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `cluster_vulnerabilities` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status e7b5b39bbb1ebfe8012de88222c88b1fef4aa00a`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete cluster_vulnerabilities --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete cluster_vulnerabilities --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete cluster_vulnerabilities`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set cluster_vulnerabilities false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-26T17:09:54.574Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T07:03:58.602Z","closed_at":"2022-03-02T21:29:49.083Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n## Release notes\n\nThe CI/CD tunnel provided by the GitLab Kubernetes Agent enables GitLab users to keep using their existing CI/CD based workflows, and still leverage the secure integration of a Kubernetes cluster with GitLab. A CI/CD tunnel can be shared among multiple groups and projects to save on resources and to simplify maintenance. \n\nUntil now, if a CI/CD tunnel was available for a project, the given tunnel could be used from all the branches, for all the environments. This functionality limited the use cases as some users would prefer to restrict access to some tunnels. Like access to the production cluster should only be available from the main branch as that describes the expected production state of the cluster.\n\nAccess to the CI/CD tunnel can now be restricted to specific environments or environments matching a wildcard pattern.\n\n## Problem to solve \n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the production cluster connection to CI jobs that reference a given environment.\n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the customer cluster connections to CI jobs that reference an environment matching a pattern.\n\n### Not in scope\n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the production cluster connection to CI jobs that run on a Git tag.\n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the production cluster connection to CI jobs that run on a Git tag following a pattern.\n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the production cluster connection to CI jobs that run on a protected branch.\n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the staging cluster connection to CI jobs that run on the main branch.\n\nAs a Platform Engineer, I want to restrict `ci_access` sharing of the dev cluster connection to CI jobs that run on a review branch.\n\n### UI proposal\n\nThe feature can be configured in code\n\n```\nci_access:\n  # This agent is accessible from CI jobs in projects in these groups\n  groups:\n  - id: group/subgroup\n    environments:\n    - staging\n  - id: group/subgroup2\n    environments:\n    - dev\n    - review/*\n```\n\n## Intended users\n\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n## User experience goal\n\nThe necessary Kubernetes context is injected only into pipelines/jobs that satisfy the requirements.\nIf `environments` is not present in config, that means all branches and environments.\n\n## Proposal\n\n```\nci_access:\n  groups:\n  - id: group/subgroup2\n    environments:\n    - review/*\n```\n\n### Default\n\n```\nci_access:\n  groups:\n  - id: group/subgroup\n```\n\nMeans that the tunnel is available on all the branches and for all the environments.\n\n### `environment:action` support\n\nThe context should be available for all [the `environment:action` categories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#environmentaction)\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [ ] [Agent] Update [agent configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/master/pkg/agentcfg/agentcfg.proto#L121-131) to accept a list of `environments` for project and group entries.\n- [ ] [Rails] Update the `allowed_agents` API to filter by environments if applicable\n- [ ] [Rails] Verify the configured environments match that of the CI job when generating the injected `KUBECONFIG`\n\n## Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n## Permissions and Security\n\nPermissions do not change in configuring the access.

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\nSigning commits just got a lot simpler. You can now use SSH keys for signing commits. Signing commits provides others with confidence that a commit or tag was authored by you. In the UI, signed commits show as \"Verified\". \n\nPreviously, it was only possible to sign commits with GPG keys or with X.509 certificates, requiring you to manage different key types for authentication and for signing. If you have ever interacted with GitLab from the command line, you most likely already have an SSH key set up in GitLab for the purpose of authentication. You can now use the same key also for signing commits. All you need to do is add three lines to your local git configuration and all future commits of yours will be signed. \n\n![Sign_commits_with_SSH](/uploads/daf71600c1408d3ca5cb365aee648a79/Sign_commits_with_SSH.gif)\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/ssh_signed_commits/\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nAs a developer, I don't want to have to manage separate keys for SSH git access and commit signing (or even use GPG at all, if we're being honest). I already have SSH keys set up for git access, and by using the same keys for commit signatures, I can get signed commits :sparkles: for free :sparkles:.  \n\n### Context\n\nThe ability to [sign commits with SSH keys](https://github.com/git/git/pull/1041) is now available in [git 2.34](https://github.com/git/git/blob/abe6bb3905392d5eb6b01fa6e54d7e784e0522aa/Documentation/RelNotes/2.34.0.txt#L81). We should add support for SSH signing for signed commits. \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n- Add SSH commit signatures\n- Allow existing SSH public keys to be used for verifying them\n\n### Related issues\n\n- We added support for x509 signatures a year ago in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29782\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Create a new signature model (`app/models/commit_signatures/ssh_signature.rb`)\n1. Update `app/models/key.rb` to be related to an SshSignature. (How to handle key revocation?)\n1. Create a new commit type (`lib/gitlab/ssh/commit.rb`)\n1. Update the signature methods in `app/models/commit.rb` to handle ssh signatures \u0026 commits\n1. Update `app/services/git/branch_hooks_service.rb` and `app/workers/create_commit_signature_worker.rb` to process SSH signatures when new commits are pushed\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO

When the first approver triggeres a job, the job runs without waiting for further appropvals.\n- Inappropriate team members can change the pipeline config\n  e.g. Basically, [Developer role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions) or above has a permission\n  to change `.gitlab-ci.yml` in a repository, including Manual Job setup.\n- Backend doesn't preserve any database records nor have class definitions. i.e. The system doesn't recognize the solution as approval feature.\n\nHaving said that we need to introduce the first-class concept at first,\nin order to properly execute the [feature vision](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342180/).\n\n### Proposal: The first-class concept\n\nHere is the overview of the feature spec of Deployment Approval:\n\n- Configuration:\n  - The feature can be configured as a part of [Protected Environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html) feature.\n  - We already have a feature to specify which user/group/role is [allowed to deploy to which environment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#protecting-environments). The same users have a privilege to approve/reject actions.\n  - As a new configuration, users can set **Required Approval Count** in a protected environment entry. The number represents how many approvals are\n    needed to proceed the deployment. The default/initial value is `0`.\n  - If the required approval count is zero, the deployment job is processed without manual intervention (i.e. no behavioal change by default).\n  - If the required approval count is set to more than one, a deployment job waits until sufficient approvals are collected from the privileged users.\n  - The deployment executor (= job triggerer) and the deployment approver can _NOT_ be the same. This is to prevent the deployment executor from accidentally bypassing the approval process.\n  - One user can give one approval, meaning the number of priviledged users should exceed the required approval count.\n  - Protected Environments, including Deployment Approval, are activated _regardless of_ [Manual Job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#when) setup (= `manual` keyword in `.gitlab-ci.yml`).\n  - [Maintainer role or above](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions) has an access to the configuration.\n- Control:\n  - A privileged user can take **approve** or **reject** action on a deployment. The system creates database records on any actions for tracking purpose.\n  - When user approves or rejects:\n    - If a deployment collects sufficient approvals, the system proceeds the deployment.\n    - If a deployment collects at least one rejection, the system fails the deployment.\n    - Else the deployment keeps waiting.\n  - After a deployment is proceeded or failed, users can't take any further actions. The records will be read-only.\n  - [Developer role or above](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions) has a read access to deployment approvals.\n    On top of that, privileged users have read-write access.\n\nThe following sections explain the technical spec.\n\n#### The database model\n\nConfiguration table for deployment approvals:\n\n```\nprotected_environments (existing)\n  - project_id integer,\n  - group_id bigint,\n  - name character varying NOT NULL,\n  - required_approvals_count: integer   (New. How many approvals are required to proceed the deployment)\n```\n\nTracking table for deployment approval actions:\n\n```\ndeployment_approvals (new table)\n  - id (PKey, bigint)\n  - deployment_id (FK, bigint, NOT NULL, Cascading Deletion)\n  - user_id (FK, bigint, NOT NULL, Cascading Deletion, the person who took the action)\n  - status (smallint/enum, NOT NULL, one of `approved` or `rejected`)\n  - created_at/updated_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,\n```\n\nAnd, add a new status `blocked` to `deployments` table.\n\n### Status transition\n\n- The pipeline jobs that are waiting for approvals are converted to `manual` status.\n- When a pipeline job transitions to `manual` status because of required approvals, the corresponding deployment transitions to `blocked` status.\n- These `manual` jobs are actionable via deployment pages/APIs and are NOT actinoalbe via pipeline jobs pages/APIs.\n- When sufficient approvals are collected, the pipeline job transitinos to `pending` status. The rests are the same behavior as today.\n- When a deployment is rejected, the pipeline job transitinos to `failed` status. The rests are the same behavior as today.\n\n### Appearance\n\n- The pipeline job page is decorated as an extended status, that it's waiting for deployment approval.\n  See [this class](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73340/diffs#92c6d9bd4821440a2b99994010ab655af37e5a8c_0_3)\n  for more information.\n\n### Interface\n\nWe extend the Public v4 API in this iteration to minimize the scope of this issue. The main UX/UI issue is [a follow-up](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342180/).\n\n- We add `required_approvals_count` field in [Protect repository environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_environments.html#protect-repository-environments) API\n- We add Approval API in the [Deployment API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deployments.html):\n    - `PUT /projects/:id/deployments/:deployment_id/approval` (Approve/Reject a deployment)\n      -  Parameters: `status` (String)\n\nFor more information, please see [the PoC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73340#how-to-use-this-feature)\n\n### Limitation\n\n- Maximum 5 approvals can be configured per protected environment. i.e. `required_approvals_count` \u003c= 5\n- In this iteration, we only support Project-level Protected Environment.\n  For the Group-Level protected environments, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345681)\n- In this iteration, the user list of \"Allowed to Deploy\" is also used as \"Allowed to Approve\".\n  This could be separated for more practical situation, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345678) for more information.\n- The manual jobs in pipeline pages are visible as `manual` jobs. This UI issue will be\n  addressed in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345683)\n\n### Alpha Version\n\nThis issue is still early iteration and we should wait for calling it as GA (Generally Availlable).\n\nWe should expliaicly mention in the documentation that this feature is [Alpha version](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#alpha)\nthat may be changed in the future without notice.\n\n### Why we should not define the authorization models in `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n\n`.gitlab-ci.yml` is stored in a project repository, meaning all users with Developer permission\nhas a right to modify the scripts. This could be a loop hole that project members\naccidentally changes the pipeline configuration and bypass the approval rules.\n\nBasically, protected environments require Maintainer role or above to configure the\nauthorization models. In addition, group-level protected environments can make it read-only for\nproject maintainers. Using these features automatically covers the proper\npermission for the configuration.\n\n### TODO\n\n- [x] Add Models/Tables - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/74932\n- [x] Add/update Service classes - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75710\n- [x] Extend APIs - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76165, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76689\n- [x] Extend Pipeline job page - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76981\n- [x] Add a new documentation page or section for explaining the feature concept, purpose and example usages.\n      Also, note that this feature is still alpha version that may be changed without notice. - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77719\n- [x] Address edge case with manual deployments (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75710#note_756445822) - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77892, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77898, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78135\n\n### PoC\n\nYou can find a PoC work in [Tech Eval Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344233#note_731043952).\n\n### Further iteration\n\n- [Separate Allowlist (user/group/role-base) for Deployment Approval](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345678)\n- [Improve Pipeline Job UI for Deployment Approvals](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345683)\n- [Support Deployment Approval for Group-Level Protected Environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345681)\n- Support approval/rejection commenting. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342439\n- Record the approval/rejection events in [Audit Events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html) too.\n\n\n### Release notes\n\nWe are excited to introduce deployment approval via API. Prior to this feature, teams had the ability to protect an environment from any changes by requiring a manual job to be executed in a pipeline as a workaround. Now, a deployment approval is a first-class concept in our platform. Teams can configure a number of approvers for a specific environment and use a new endpoint via API to execute an approval or rejection of a deployment.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-26T08:43:17.056Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T13:01:37.012Z","closed_at":"2022-02-07T19:57:40.717Z","closed_by":{"id":4373269,"username":"ali-gitlab","name":"Alishan Ladhani","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4373269/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ali-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Environment Management","GitLab Premium","Next Up","Release::P1","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::release","group::release","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},{"id":4373269,"username":"ali-gitlab","name":"Alishan Ladhani","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4373269/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ali-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":48,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343864","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343864","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343864/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343864/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343864","relative":"#343864","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343864"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7818,"epic":{"id":486644,"iid":7818,"title":"(Minimal maturity) Deployment Approvals","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7818","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96140189,"iid":343851,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Configuration UI to support enabling IaC - Frontend","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nWith the introduction of IaC Security Testing (name subject to change), we are letting users configure the job via the Security Configuration page.

deciding on using `kics` as the IaC scanner to be used for SAST's IaC product offering, we were contemplating using multiple scanners for different IaCs -- Terrascan for terraform, ansible-lint for ansible, checkov/kics for CF. This lead to the creation of the [terrascan repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/terrascan). As you can probably guess by the repo name, the analyzer wraps `terrascan`. Since the repo is early in development we can easily replace the scanner by updating a few lines of code.

For detailed requirements for what records and data need to be created in SFDC, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/128).\n\n## Requirements\n\nEnsure all customer and subscription records are created in Zuora.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- CustomersDot already has a pretty complex set of services to create the SFDC Account and related Opportunity and Quote objects using the Customer account and Subscription information. I'm hopeful we can leverage most of these services, but I can already tell that some modifications will need to be made. Here are a few places that might need modification:\n  - The `CreateOpportunityService` [creates the object with a default ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/3e337f22849ca3f6a50ead74282506616342bcb8/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_service.rb#L100)`LeadSource` of `Web Direct`. I suspect this will be modified, possibly pulled from Arrow data.\n  - The issue describes locating account and contact based on matching criteria. This would be new logic as CustomersDot currently either reuses the Account if the Customer record has a `sfdc_account_id`, and otherwise creates a new one.\n- This could be a pretty involved issue if there are substantial changes to the existing services. Alternatively, it might be less involved if this turns out to re-use most of the services as-is. Given the difficulty in working with SFDC and testing the integration, at a minimum I'd say it's a weight of 3 but could be as much as an 8 depending on the extent of changes to existing services.\n- Weight: 8\n\n_* proposal and weight extracted from Tyler's analysis

The email used for the reseller is pulled from the work_email of the subscription invoice_owner contact account.\n- The [issue description](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/132#details) states the \"contact is different from the Sell To, Invoice Owner, or Bill To contacts and will most likely not be stored in Zuora\". Given that, it sounds like we would have to fetch this information from SFDC which would be new work. However, the step to create data in SFDC is after this step, so I'm not sure where we should get this information.\n- I'm curious what this means for the existing reseller logic. Would this need to be modified or disabled for E-Disty subscriptions?\n- Would the Partner Contact email address be added to the existing email, or would it require a new email with specialized copy? The former would likely be less effort.\n- Weight: 3-5 (This one is difficult to say with certainty based on the questions above)\n\n_* proposal and weight extracted from Tyler's analysis [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/132#note_713339231)_","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-25T19:27:26.442Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T17:38:01.457Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T17:38:01.133Z","closed_by":{"id":7971452,"username":"teresatison","name":"Teresa Tison","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7971452/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teresatison"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Provision","auto updated","devops::fulfillment","eDisty","group::provision","section::fulfillment","type::feature"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":7971452,"username":"teresatison","name":"Teresa Tison","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7971452/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teresatison"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343814","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343814","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343814/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/343814/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343814","relative":"#343814","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#343814"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":96273916,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96108028,"iid":343813,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Purchase] SubscribeService: CustomersDot Data","description":"## Summary\n\nAfter Zuora has received all the necessary information, the SubscribeService API should create the customer account with all related info in CustomersDot.

This might be my confusion, but I thought the purpose of this issue was to define the transaction from CustomersDot into Zuora. However, the description includes information about Quote-related objects, which I thought were SFDC-related, and that this information would be fed into SFDC after successful entry into Zuora (as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/128).\n- What would be helpful to assess LOE for this issue might be to understand what exactly needs to be sent in the subscribe API request to Zuora. Or another way to think about it might be to understand how this the Zuora subscribe request differs from the current request from a web direct purchase.\n- Just to confirm, the new CustomersDot API will only handling new subscription purchases, correct?

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nDeployment frequency appears in two different locations under value stream analytics and under [CI/CD Analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html) - they are both using the same API\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/0056f5d3057a95e1a69410186fe5d562/image.png)\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/32fdc5a2355af050c8de824cc8d45dcb/image.png)\n\n\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n\nIn [CI/CD Analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html), it would be nice to add the deployment frequency and number of deployments tiles to the deployment frequency tab, like this:\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/504b8dcd3cf7dd9ecfc886b022092f49/image.png)\n\nThings to note:\n\n- A license check should be performed (for Ultimate) if using the VSA API, so it would be better to use the DORA API because that is already restricted to Ultimate.\n- The tiles should represent the same interval that is displayed on the CI/CD Analytics page.\n- CI/CD Analytics shows only deployment to production environments - deployment frequency in VSA shows? \n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

the server will close the connection.

Each CustomBinaryReaderPipeline will end up with a dedicated reader task that buffers the incoming socket data and separate parsing code.\n\n1. [x] Write a new `CustomBinaryReaderPipeline`\n1.
