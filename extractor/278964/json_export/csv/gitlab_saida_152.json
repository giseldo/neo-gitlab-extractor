Obtaining it means, that a waiting queue is maintained for each `resource_group` which determines who is allowed to work with it next (a queueing mechanism should already exist for `resource_group` as part of the semaphore primitive implemented).\n\nCurrently the lock is obtained and waited for right before the job starts, which ensures that no jobs run at the same time for the same resource. But when a job is ready to start (and is therefore requesting a lock), depends on the non-deterministic runtimes of previous jobs and the concurrent sheduling of jobs in general.\n\nAn alternative option that this feature should introduce is to obtain the lock when the job is created (which happens when the pipeline is created). This means that jobs wanting to work on the same `resource_group` are forced to work in the order in that they are created. This ensures that older jobs are always running before newer jobs for one particular `resource_group`. The downside of this is that the jobs might have to wait longer for a resource to become free in some situations. Jobs for other `resource_groups` or jobs without them, should not be affected by this and will still benefit from concurrent execution.\n\n**Sample Configuration**\n\nAssumtion: Allowing `resource_group` to be optionally defined as an dictionary, using a property named `resource` to represent the string value from the non-dictionary mode.\n\nThis feature shall add a new property named `lock_at` (or `obtain_at`, `obtain_lock_at`, `*_on`, etc.) with the two possible values `create` and `start`.\n\nThe default value for this setting should in my opinion be `create`.\nIt should result in having less issues due to race conditions and wrongly ordered deployments for users that are unaware of possible problems.\nBut this is debatable, the current behavior for `resource_group` would be that of `start`.\nI can understand, that you'd not want to change it now that `resource_group` is released.\n\n```yml\n# pipeline-level\nresource_group:\n  resource: \"Resource 1\"\n  lock_at: create\n\njob_a:\n  script: \"echo a\"\n  resource_group:\n    resource: 'Resource 2'\n    lock_at: create\n\njob_b:\n  script: \"echo b\"\n  resource_group:\n    resource: 'Resource 2'\n    lock_at: start\n    # I don't know if mixing this setting for the same resource is useful for anything, but we shouldn't restrict it.\n\njob_c:\n  script: \"echo c\"\n  resource_group:\n    resource: 'Resource 3'\n    lock_at: start\n    # But I can think of situations where mixing it in the same pipeline for diferent resources might be useful.\n```\n\nA `create` lock for jobs should happen after the `create` lock on the pipeline-level. Pipeline `start` can only happen after the creation of the pipeline and all the jobs for it. A job at the first stage that has a `start` value should lock the resource directly after the `start` lock of the pipeline.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nExtend the documentation for `resource_group` here: [GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration Reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/#resource_group)\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n**What risks does this change pose to our availability?**\nIt might make pipeline jobs wait longer for resources to become available, if the default is changed or the new option is used manually.\n\n**How might it affect the quality of the product?**\n- It should improve the reliability of concurrent pipelines that access shared `resource_group`s\n- Users that define their CI/CD Pipeline Configuration have a new option to fine-tune it for their use-case.\n\n**What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?**\n\u003cbr/\u003eIt should be tested that there are no dead locks introduced by this feature. If I'm not mistaken, there shouldn't be any for this change in theory.

Add Default Issue Lists for Issue Boards","description":"## Problem\n\n- Not setting default lists automatically for new Issue Boards increases the barrier to entry and adoption for first time users of Issue Boards.\n\n## Goal\n\n- Decrease time to value for Issue Boards\n\n## Proposal\n\n- When a new Group is created, automatically create `To Do` and `Doing` labels with a fairly vanilla description for each. \n- For each sub-group, sub-sub-group, and project within the hierarchy, the `To Do` and `Doing` labels should be inherited. \n- If the project is being created outside of a group, automatically create the labels in the project. \n- On the issue board, Instead of showing the temporary issue list prompting the user to \"add default lists\" or \"nevermind, i'll create my own\", automatically seed the Issue Board with `Open`, `To Do`, `Doing`, and `Closed` Issue Lists.\n- When creating a new Issue Board, automatically seed the board with the lists from :point_up:. \n\n### UX\n\n![default lists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/5e8d92ab3f5031a7df2b24f25b83b1c7/Screen_Shot_2020-06-03_at_4.59.39_PM.png)\n\n## Other Considerations \u0026 Context Around Labels\n\n- Consider a large organization with many teams and projects using the top level `To Do` label on their issue boards. That label can be easily deleted, which would irreversibly cascade down their the entire sub-group/project hierarchy resulting in data lost on issues and the issue list disappearing from every single issue board that uses it. Maybe we should consider making label deletion safer and less destructive :thinking: \n- If we default to creating these labels on each and every project, we then have the annoyance of duplicated labels `n` number of times through the entire sub-group hierarchy with no feedback in the UI which label belongs to which group, sub-group, or project -- leading to people inadvertently selecting the wrong `To Do` label and issue not showing up on the issue board. We should probably address this via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/24553. \n- There is also the existing annoyance of different behavior of labels depending on what context the label is applied - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/17461. There are also strong advocates that don't want labels removed when issues are closed from the issue board.\n\n### Release Notes\n\nIn most cases, teams will be best served by keeping their workflows as simple as possible. To encourage this and make the first touch experience with a Board more efficient and approachable, creating a new Board will now automatically pre-populate `To Do` and `Doing` lists so you can get straight to managing Issues.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#first-time-using-an-issue-board","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-05T18:28:46.633Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:12:17.970Z","closed_at":"2020-10-02T16:38:03.611Z","closed_by":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","boards","devops::plan","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","good for new contributors","group::project management","release post item::in review","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},{"id":4478389,"username":"kokeefe","name":"Keanon O'Keefe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4478389/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kokeefe"}],"author":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"user_notes_count":42,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":3,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/202144","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202144","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202144/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202144/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#202144","relative":"#202144","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#202144"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3900,"epic":{"id":80936,"iid":3900,"title":"Refactor Issue Boards to use GraphQL + VueX","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3900","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30438207,"iid":202143,"project_id":278964,"title":"[VSA] Incorrectly saying \"not enough data\" for stages that average less than 1 second","description":"### Summary\n\nIt's possible for a Cycle Analytics stage to be completed in less than 1 second on average.

Create and provide a mapping.\r\n\r\n### Intended users\r\n\r\nThis is for internal GitLab use to support #6061.\r\n\r\n### Further details\r\n\r\nThis supports issue #6061 by providing a link to an artifact captured in a test to be pulled into the front end. \r\n\r\nSome use cases to consider:\r\n\r\n* File is available\r\n* No file is available / pass an error the front end can deal with\r\n  * This could be a file is missing (most likely) and the front end should get that info\r\n  * This may be invalid format? (we may make the front end handle that)\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\n### Current proposal\r\n\r\n#### 1. Change our screenshots names on test failures \r\n\r\nWe need to provide a 1:1 mapping between our `RSpec` failures and our `JUnit` xml in order to figure out where to fetch this screenshot. This could be done by leveraging the [full_description](https://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec%2FCore%2FExample:full_description) of an `RSpec` object which is accessible in `JUnit` with the [name attributes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/test_case.rb#L16).\r\n\r\nThis means we will change the way we persist screenshots from this convention to this one:\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| ------ | ------ |\r\n| `../browser_ui/1_manage/group/groups_permission_checks_spec.rb_2020-02-28-17-25-22.691.png` | `../verify_pipeline_creation_and_processing_users_creates_a_pipeline_which_gets_processed.html` |\r\n\r\nThis can be done by changing how we persist screenshot [with Capybara](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/qa/qa/runtime/browser.rb#L126)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCapybara::Screenshot.append_timestamp = false\r\nCapybara::Screenshot.register_filename_prefix_formatter(:rspec) do |example|\r\n  ::File.join(QA::Runtime::Namespace.name, example.full_description.downcase.parameterize(separator: \"_\"))\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith our current `RSpec` setting each failing test gets assigned a screenshot metadata to it which makes it easier to understand where the screenshot lives.\r\n\r\n![goldenson_Maximes-MacBook-Pro____Code_gitlab-development-kit_gitlab_qa_2020-03-05_17-36-05](/uploads/9cbc936e0eb8611db516373e633c3417/goldenson_Maximes-MacBook-Pro____Code_gitlab-development-kit_gitlab_qa_2020-03-05_17-36-05.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNext challenge here would be to \"persist\" this data somewhere. Which bring me to my next point.\r\n\r\n#### 2. CustomFormatter\r\n\r\nWe have 2 options here:\r\n\r\n- ~~We contribute to the [current formatter](https://github.com/sj26/rspec_junit_formatter) we are using today~~\r\n- We decided to add the [screenshot metadata](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/support/capybara.rb#L130-133) generated by `Capybara` to our rspec failure:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nif example.metadata[:screenshot]\r\n  screenshot = example.metadata[:screenshot][:image] || example.metadata[:screenshot][:html]\r\n  example.metadata[:stdout] = %{[[ATTACHMENT|#{screenshot}]]}\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Parse JUnit Report\r\n\r\nNow that this information lives in a `JUnit XML report` file we would need to parse it and store in order to be able to send it to the front end.\r\n\r\n`JUnit XML` report containing a `system-out` tag with the `ATTACHMENT` which will can now be parsed by GitLab. This data is now available on a [TestCase](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/test_case.rb#L25) object.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\u003csystem-out\u003e\r\n  [[ATTACHMENT|/Users/goldenson/Code/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab/qa/tmp/qa-test-2020-03-27-13-39-00-76dfdbbdfe527962/verify_pipeline_creation_and_processing_users_creates_a_pipeline_which_gets_processed.png]]\r\n\u003c/system-out\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 4. Expose screenshot to the front end\r\n\r\n1. A new attribute has been added to our `TestCase API` introducing an [attachment_url](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/serializers/test_case_entity.rb#L12-14) which contains the full path to the failed screenshot.\r\n\r\n2. We will expose a new `scope=with_attachment` attribute on our [test_report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/projects/pipelines_controller.rb#L162-180) endpoint. This way the front end will be able to display failing screenshots for a given pipeline.\r\n\r\n| Test report without attachment | Test report with attachment |\r\n| ------ | ------ |\r\n| ![Mozilla_Firefox_2020-03-25_16-25-29](/uploads/d9174ebbece237ae0c5b71eaa9d9b41a/Mozilla_Firefox_2020-03-25_16-25-29.png) | ![Mozilla_Firefox_2020-03-25_16-25-44](/uploads/69fbb39a0de8f3eec5cc733f7439c6fa/Mozilla_Firefox_2020-03-25_16-25-44.png) |\r\n\r\n### Permissions and Security\r\n\r\nThis feature is behind the `junit_pipeline_screenshots_view` feature flag ([attachment_url](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/serializers/test_case_entity.rb#L21)) and only for internal purpose at the moment.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n* N/A if this is internal.\r\n* Update API docs is this is available.\r\n\r\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\r\n\r\n@zeffmorgan can you take a look here at your convenience? \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\r\n\r\n What risks does this change pose to our availability?

pipeline that creates an artifact, e.g. a textfile and make it an artifact\n- have a child pipeline that attempts to simply display the content of the textfile it tries to obtain by using the needs: keyword as shown in the documentation\n- wonder about the \"no such file\" error

(**branch: parent-child-artifact**)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe artifact is not downloaded, in fact, there isn't even any notion of any attempt at doing so - I would at least expect some error message if downloading artifacts fails\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe artifact files downloaded, either as a zip archive or as they have been created by the job in the parent pipeline\n\nIn any case, I'd expect some output lines that some artifact (name, ...) is attempted to be downloaded.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n#### the parent

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nTBD\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nThe current handling of a restarted pipeline does not associate the correct username with jobs that are subsequently executed when a job is retried by someone other than the original user who triggered the pipeline. While the retried job is accurately attributed to the \"retry user\", all other subsequent jobs that run (when the retried job is successful) are still associated with the original user. This makes it difficult from an audit perspective to satisfy the expectation that actions should be traceable back to a single user.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nChange the user of the skipped jobs to match the user retrying a previous job. This means that the `job user` would always match who runs the jobs while the `pipeline user` matches who creates the jobs when creating the pipeline.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

However, if the job that has been retried is part of a pipeline subsequent jobs/stages that are run after a success remain associated with the original user who triggered the pipeline.\n\nThis does not seem ideal as it was the action of the user who retried the job that leads to subsequent jobs being run. For instance, if I cancel a job with a some sort of CD associated with it I may have done so for a reason. I may not want another user (even if they are a developer on the project) from causing a pipeline associated with my user account from continuing to  run.\n\ncc: `@mterhar`\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project with two developers (`userA` \u0026 `userB`)\n2. Establish a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with at minimum two stages, with a job in each stage\n3. `userA` triggers a pipeline\n4. Canceled the first job before completion so the second job/stage is never reached\n5. `userB` retries the first job\n6. After the first job is successful remaining jobs are still associated with the original user (`userA`)\n\n### Example Project\n\n`.gitlab-ci.yml` - https://gitlab.com/paulbry/runner-scratch/-/blob/pipeline-trigger/.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nPipe results - https://gitlab.com/paulbry/runner-scratch/pipelines/114966540 \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIf a job fails / canceled by one user and retried by another I would expect that unless I retry subsequent jobs (or the entire pipeline) they should not be run.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![job-retry-issue](/uploads/94f247100f7040ea2f077cd954a773f0/job-retry-issue.png)\n\nNote, the screen shot was taken a self-hosted deployment but I've since confirmed that issue exists on GitLab.com as well.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-05T13:50:38.740Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T11:19:29.482Z","closed_at":"2021-01-13T00:33:44.187Z","closed_by":{"id":5709468,"username":"cheryl.li","name":"Cheryl Li","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709468/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cheryl.li"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","backend","devops::verify","direction","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:13.7","pipeline processing","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"}],"author":{"id":2592780,"username":"paulbry","name":"Paul Bryant","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2592780/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/paulbry"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"user_notes_count":49,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/202082","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202082","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202082/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/202082/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#202082","relative":"#202082","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#202082"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":30407472,"iid":202067,"project_id":278964,"title":"Issue returned as `blocked: false` when marked as blocked-by","description":"### Summary\n\nMarking an issue as blocking another one results in the issue being correctly returned by the internal API as `blocked: true`.

Error on the secondary\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIf the secondary stores LFS in local storage: It fails because the status code is 302, and [this codepath](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.7.2-ee/ee/lib/gitlab/geo/replication/base_transfer.rb#L127) does not `follow` by default.\n\nIf the secondary stores LFS in remote storage: [This codepath](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v12.7.2-ee/ee/lib/gitlab/geo/replication/base_transfer.rb#L182) does `::HTTP.follow.get()` so it follows the redirect, but `httprb` adds the `Gl-Geo` `Authorization` headers from the original request to the primary, so S3 responds with `400 Bad Request` saying `there is more than one authorization method`.\n\nIf we generate the request URL and headers, and make the request with `curl`, it works (`200` and receives the binary data) because it follows the redirect and does not add the original `Authorization` headers.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe secondary should successfully download the file.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n(If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nGitLab 12.7.2\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-04T20:58:04.330Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T17:17:21.414Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T19:43:53.413Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","Deliverable","Stuff that should Just Work","customer","devops::systems","group::geo","missed-deliverable","missed:12.10","missed:12.8","missed:12.9","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201995","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201995","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201995/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201995/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#201995","relative":"#201995","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#201995"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30386910,"iid":201971,"project_id":278964,"title":"dotNET CI Template uses deprecated variable","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\ndotNet template for .gitlab-ci.yml still uses deprecated $CI_BULD_TAG\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn a project repo:\n1.

The problem is that the garbage collection algorithm is inefficient and can take a long time to run. \n\nThere are two key stages to the process, the `mark` stage, which identifies which images/tags can be deleted, and the `sweep` stagee, which deletes them. We recently [optimized both of these stages for S3](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2553) and saw significant improvements. We need to do the same for Google cloud storage, so that we can unblock our customers utilizing GCS from running garbage collection and lowering their cost of storage. \n\n### Intended users\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### GCS Bulk Delete\n- We intended to update GCS to take advantage of bulk delete by adding support for batch operations in the upstream GCS client library (by taking advantage of the [JSON API batch support](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/batch)) is not feasible at the moment.\n- Upon further investigation, we found that the Google team wants to evaluate and eventually rollout batch support for all official client libraries in a consistent way and likely at the same time.\n- As an example, here is the feature request for the Go and Ruby client libraries:\n  * https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/1040#issuecomment-432033773\n  * https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/issues/2914#issuecomment-468844960\n- Both of these point to the same centralized issue on Google's issue tracker: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/142641783\n- Therefore we won't be able to take advantage of bulk delete requests for now. Our primary focus will be leveraging on concurrency. The results won't be as outstanding as for S3 but I still expect them to be great.\n\n#### Current Behavior\nThe GC *sweep* stage starts by looking for a list of manifests and blobs that should be deleted. The manifests list is built during the *mark* stage (recursive path walk), and the blob list is made similarly, but during the *sweep* stage.\n\nWith the list of manifests and blobs to delete, the GC uses `storage.Vacuum` as an intermediate for the storage driver, removing objects from the backend.\n\n### Proposal\nIdentify and implement performance optimizations for the `sweep` stage of the garbage collection algorithm for GCS. \n- Since gitlab.com utilizes GCS for Container Registry storage, we can run performance tests and benchmarks on dev.gitlab.com. This will help inform how we can scale to the production version of gitlab.com\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes needed for this issue.\n\n### Documentation\n- There are no documentation changes needed for this issue.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability?

parent-child pipelines does not support `when: manual` configs, with the docs stating \"`when:manual` prevents triggers being used.\"  The best reasoning I can find for this is a slight mention in a [note in MR 9107](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/9107#note_133729325):\n\n\u003e we might not want to support `delayed` and `manual` yet\n\n[Customer requesting](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/146018) (internal only) the use of manual actions for parent-child pipelines.  Their specific use-case here is to refactor `.gitlab-ci.yml` to separate out certain stages from an otherwise fairly complex CI/CD, and wanting to limit their deploy job to a manual action.\n\nIs there a specific reason for limiting the use of `when:manual`, and if so, perhaps the [docs for parent-child pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html) could be updated to reflect that? If not, was it ever an intention to implement that functionality?\n\nIt's technically possible to implement this using a parent job to trigger a child pipeline that then uses manual jobs, so there is a workaround to this feature request at present.  But since `trigger` supports `when` (on_success, on_failure, and always), it is a valid question from the end-user perspective as to why `manual` is not currently supported.\n\n[Related docs improvement issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30257) for `trigger` and `when:manual`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-04T18:48:03.893Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T14:38:57.140Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T19:46:43.112Z","closed_by":{"id":5709468,"username":"cheryl.li","name":"Cheryl Li","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709468/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cheryl.li"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Pipeline Authoring","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","UX","backend","bridge pipelines","customer","devops::verify","direction","docs::improvement","documentation","group::pipeline authoring","internal customer","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":4447183,"username":"kevenhughes","name":"Keven Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4447183/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kevenhughes"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":30,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":81,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201938","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201938","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201938/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201938/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#201938","relative":"#201938","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#201938"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":30382098,"iid":201931,"project_id":278964,"title":"White syntax highlighting theme for Web IDE","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nGitLab currently supports a `White` syntax highlighting preference for viewing blobs in the repository.

The presence of those styles causes problems with appearance of other themes, now that we plan to add many more via https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2389. \n\nFor now, the MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24158 makes sure the overridden styles in the `ide.scss` don't interfere with any dark themes, but it will be a problem when we have to implement Solarized Light theme in the future.\n\nSo we will need to move the styles (that define any colors) in `ide.scss` to the theme file as a pre-requisite to implementing the Solarized Light theme.\n\ncc @rkuba @phikai","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-04T16:37:37.437Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T16:06:37.391Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T16:06:37.329Z","closed_by":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"labels":["CSS refactor","Category:Web IDE","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","maintenance::refactor"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"}],"author":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201900","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201900","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201900/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201900/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#201900","relative":"#201900","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#201900"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2389,"epic":{"id":17208,"iid":2389,"title":"Use GitLab Syntax Highlighting Preference for Web IDE","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2389","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30373325,"iid":201893,"project_id":278964,"title":"Resolve soft email confirmation flow","description":"For https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/47003 we introduced a feature flag (soft_email_confirmation) in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/31245.

During initial indexing it's likely we're going to keep causing this to happen. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/195774 we decided to handle timeouts better by reducing bundle size if the request timed out.\n\nBut this doesn't necessarily stop us exceeding heap memory if the bulk requests are queueing while the cluster is busy. What this error indicates is that we should avoid sending massive bulk requests altogether as the consequences can be quite bad.\n\n## Solution\n\nSimilar to the proposal in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/195774 we should see if it's feasible to set a limit on bulk API size so that we decrease bundle size before making the request to the cluster if the request payload exceeds 1MB in size.\n\nTo do this we construct the bulk payload and if it exceeds 1MB we stop and create a smaller payload with fewer records (100, 10, 1). Lastly when we get down to 1 record if the payload is still larger than 1MB then we should truncate the fields which are too large in the payload.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-03T20:43:03.912Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:24:56.504Z","closed_at":"2020-03-08T23:58:58.410Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","Deliverable","advanced search","bug::performance","devops::data_stores","group::global search","reliability","type::feature","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201805","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201805","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201805/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201805/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#201805","relative":"#201805","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#201805"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2526,"epic":{"id":18587,"iid":2526,"title":"Increase the stability of Advanced Search pipeline","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2526","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 21, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30336186,"iid":201792,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group security dashboard vulnerability history endpoint timing out","description":"### Summary\n\nOn the `gitlab-org` group security [dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/security/dashboard), the vulnerability history endpoint times out.

One of the arguments to that job is the list of all changed fields for the resource. This is serialized as a JSON hash, and can be quite long. It also gets in the way of calculating whether the job is identical to another, previous job for the same resource for deduplication purposes: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/issues/42#note_280297040\n\n## Improvements\n\nWe should be able to remove the `changed_fields` attribute entirely.\n\nWhen we push a new document to elasticsearch, we always generate and push a complete document - we never perform a partial update.\n\nThe `changed_fields` key is used for two things:\n\n- Determine if an elasticsearch-tracked field has changed\n- Determine whether subresources also need to be updated\n\nThe first can be calculated **prior** to pushing the job to sidekiq. The second can be a simple boolean instead, again calculated upfront.\n\nNaively, this could halve the size of each `ElasticIndexerWorker` job being held in Redis, which is valuable because we generate so many of them at present. It will also mean we push fewer jobs overall, since we're determining whether we need to do an elasticsearch update upfront.\n\n## Risks\n\nChanging arguments for a sidekiq job can be tricky. Fortunately, `changed_fields` is a member of the `opts` hash, which is passed through as serialised JSON, and its position is not changing. So this should be a safe change.\n\nWe move a tiny amount of work from sidekiq to unicorn/puma - nothing to be worried about.\n\nOpen question: What else is in the `opts` hash? Is this everything we need to get to deduplicate-able jobs, or just part of it?\n\n## Involved components\n\n- [`ee/app/workers/elastic_indexer_worker.rb`](ee/app/workers/elastic_indexer_worker.rb)\n- [`ee/app/services/elastic/index_record_service.rb`](ee/app/services/elastic/index_record_service.rb)\n- [`ee/app/models/concerns/elastic/application_versioned_search.rb`](ee/app/models/concerns/elastic/application_versioned_search.rb)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-03T12:59:11.069Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:24:57.935Z","closed_at":"2020-02-26T08:31:47.950Z","closed_by":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","advanced search","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::data_stores","group::global search"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201754","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201754","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201754/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/201754/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#201754","relative":"#201754","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#201754"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2526,"epic":{"id":18587,"iid":2526,"title":"Increase the stability of Advanced Search pipeline","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2526","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 21, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30294079,"iid":201744,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove feature flag :stage_all_by_default","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:stage_all_by_default` feature flag ...\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Create:Editor\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_editor`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @himkp \n\n## Expectations\n\nThe feature flag was added in %12.7 as a safety net in case the feedback around staging everything by default (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33441) was not positive.
