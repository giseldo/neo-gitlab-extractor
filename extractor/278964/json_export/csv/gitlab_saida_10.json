Add to the current details component, so it supports both HAML and GraphQL data.\n2. Transform either the HAML- or GraphQL data so the component gets a normalized data structure.\n3. Create a new component that will eventually replace the current one.\n\nAfter some brainstorming it was concluded that approach `3` might be the best solution, since it will allow us to:\n\n* Work on the GraphQL migration behind a feature flag, without any danger of breaking the feature on production. This also means less manual testing efforts while working on it.\n* Deprecate the current component (via renaming it and including a `_deprecated` or `_legacy` suffix)\n* Create a clean, uncluttered component that - once the migration has been completed - can be used as is, without any modification to it\n* It let's us remove some technical debt (for example remove the `.md` class, which currently wraps the data-listing and causes some styling issues)\n* ... I am sure I am missing some - feel free to add to this :slight_smile: \n\nPotential drawbacks:\n\n* Might create a bit of maintenance overhead, since we will need to support the HAML  version until the GraphQL migration has been completed (for both the pipeline and details page)\n* Possible code duplication until the legacy component (and specs) are removed\n* ... I am sure I am missing some - feel free to add to this :slight_smile:","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-19T08:06:21.906Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T19:13:08.534Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T19:13:05.544Z","closed_by":{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Threat Insights::Navy","devops::govern","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::threat insights","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371314","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371314","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371314/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371314/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371314","relative":"#371314","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371314"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8459,"epic":{"id":574252,"iid":8459,"title":"Pipeline Security Tab GraphQL migration: add missing fields to the vulnerability-details component","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8459","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113503843,"iid":371279,"project_id":278964,"title":"BE: Allow sorting by health status in the issue list","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow sorting by health status in the issue list.

{\n    value: String!\n  }\n\n  type VulnerabilityGenericReportDiff {\n    before: String!\n    after: String!\n  }\n\n  type VulnerabilityGenericReportFileLocation {\n    fileName: String!\n

finding's modal for the generic report type.\n\n\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nFor each type, using a separate MR, do the following:\n\n- [ ] ~backend Add type file\n- [ ] ~backend Add type to `PipelineSecurityReportFinding`\n\nThe Generic Report type may add some complexity here, so bumping it to a weight 3\n\n### Testing\n\n- [ ] Add graphql specs\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1. Run the following GraphQL query on the [security reports test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports).\n\n```\nproject(fullPath:\"\u003cproject path\u003e\") {\n    pipeline(iid:\"\u003cpipeline iid\u003e\") {\n      securityReportFindings(scanner:\"zaproxy\") {\n        nodes {\n          uuid\n          details {\n            ... on  VulnerabilityDetailDiff {\n              before\n              after\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n2. Run the following query on the corresponding Vulnerability (should be the `X-Frame-Options Header Not Set` DAST vulnerability)\n\n```\nvulnerability(id:\"gid://gitlab/Vulnerability/\u003cVulnerability ID\u003e\") {\n    details {\n      ... on VulnerabilityDetailDiff {\n        before\n        after\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-18T20:06:21.270Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T18:35:08.809Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T18:35:08.783Z","closed_by":{"id":7825316,"username":"subashis","name":"Subashis  Chakraborty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7825316/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/subashis"},"labels":["auto updated","backend","devops::govern","group::threat insights","missed:15.5","quad-planning::complete-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":7825316,"username":"subashis","name":"Subashis  Chakraborty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7825316/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/subashis"}],"author":{"id":4473655,"username":"jschafer","name":"Jonathan Schafer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9a0dad78ff350f1f7fffd44514269a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jschafer"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7825316,"username":"subashis","name":"Subashis  Chakraborty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7825316/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/subashis"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371261","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371261","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371261/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371261/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371261","relative":"#371261","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371261"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8459,"epic":{"id":574252,"iid":8459,"title":"Pipeline Security Tab GraphQL migration: add missing fields to the vulnerability-details component","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8459","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113485245,"iid":371249,"project_id":278964,"title":"NoMethodError: undefined method `get_ingresses' for #\u003cKubeclient::Client:0x00007fc473b00ad8\u003e","description":"https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/3355029/?referrer=gitlab_plugin\n\n```\nNoMethodError: undefined method `get_ingresses' for #\u003cKubeclient::Client:0x00007fc473b00ad8\u003e\nDid you mean?

GitLab members can read more in the [ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/309389).\n\nThe problem seems to relate to rendering JSON returned by `/namespace/repo/-/refs/path/to/directory?format=json\u0026offset=xxx`\n\nThis issue is a request for help from ~\"group::source code\" - I don't know how to debug this further.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Customer reported the issue at 14.10.5 after upgrading from 14.2\n- I understand [14.3 changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69274) how file listings from Git repos are loaded by the GitLab WebUI:\n  - A graphql query loads the file listing for the page\n  - The commit details are then loaded in batches of 25\n- Looking at the HAR output, for the offsets `0`, `25`, `50`, `75`, `100`, `125`:\n  - No more batches load, but there are 200 files, so there should be more batches (`150` is definitely valid, it's attached to the ticket).\n  - Each loads from the backend fairly quickly. 600ms is the longest, but most are 125-200ms, the last two to load are 199ms and 127ms.  I don't think it's a backend problem (more below).\n  - The time delays **between** requesting each JSON batch are fairly consistent for the first five batches.\n  - However, between batches `100` and `125` (the last one) ~21 seconds elapses.\n  - See screenshot from HAR file, which is supplied on the ticket July 28th.\n    - Note the very long elapsed time between batches 100 and 125, and that batch 150 is not requested.\n    - My guess is that rendering batch 125 triggers the browser warning.\n\n![HAR-time-elapsed](/uploads/9974536b1d9e24ee2b14f926047e67b9/HAR-time-elapsed.png)\n\nIt's not a problem with pulling that JSON from the back end. \n\n[1] The repository is small.\n\n- Total commit history on their main working branch is `11701`. \n- The repo shows in the UI as 67mb.\n- The total number of files in the directory affected are `203`.\n\n[2] The HAR file shows that JSON requests are quick\n\n[3] I've generated slow backend (Gitay) performance in a test environment, and in this case, the failure on the front end is different from what the customer is seeing.\n\n- The browser is happy to wait for the (max) 30 seconds that Workhorse/Rails are prepared to wait for Gitaly to return the data.\n- If the JSON is returned in time, it's sent to the browser.\n- If the 30 second timeout is reached, a 500 is sent to the browser, and the frontend code stops trying to load the page;  no more batches are requested.\n\n- If the JSON is returned in time, it's sent to the browser.\nI tested this using https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab project, cloned to a self-managed instance.  Some of the directories of large files in our code base take a long time (on my slow test system) to load the commit batches as JSON from Gitaly, and I was able to exceed the 30 second timeout.\n\nWe have the raw JSON for the file commits on the ticket (August 10th).  I asked them to download all the batches up to where it fails, and beyond.  I've looked at the json, and by eye I can't see any problems with it.  I was wondering if there might be some unexpected data being returned by the backend.  If this is the case, it's not obvious.\n\n- Their activities in this particular directory in the repository are primary via the GitLab web interface.\n- The files here are managed by an operational team that aren't developers, and so don't use the Git CLI.\n\nrelated issues:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361004  (they're not using codeowners)\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333669 is currently scheduled for %\"15.4\" and might help here\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.

Given this can break approval rules I've marked it as confidential until the group confirms it can be released as public information.\n\nI've assigned @vyaklushin for review of this issue to confirm it is related to the feature.\n\nOriginally reported in [this ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/316631), a customer has indicated approval rules aren't working correctly. From further examination it was found they extensively use subgroups in their approval rules.\n\nWe've taken steps to re-produce this in both SaaS and Self-managed, with the former being available to GitLab team members in [this example project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/benjaminking/broken-approvals/project) and [this merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/benjaminking/broken-approvals/project/-/merge_requests/3). For Self-managed instances, you must use GitLab 15.2 and enable the feature flag with: \n\n```\nFeature.enable(:subgroups_approval_rules)\n```\nAnd create a new merge request to see the behaviour.\n\n|Self-Managed (without feature flag) - GIF |Self-Managed (with feature flag) - GIF|\n|--|--|\n|![working](/uploads/bc38008e92a2b393d4f9c778076d38d3/working.gif)| ![broken](/uploads/e34b6b94d3b4b8de8655911b8f3314ea/broken.gif)|\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOn GitLab.com (SaaS):\n\nYou will need to have a project and subgroup to use as a group for approval rules.\n\n1. Create a group that is linked to a Premium subscription. An easy example is a subgroup using [`gitlab-gold`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold) if you have access. \n1. Create a subgroup. \n2. Under the subgroup, create a project named 'Project'.\n3. Under the subgroup, create another subgroup, named 'code-approvers-group'.\n4. Under the 'code-approvers-group' group, create another subgroup named 'reviewers-one'\n\nThe structure should be similar to: \n\nProject: \n`Parent → subgroup → Project`\n\nGroup:\n`Parent → subgroup → code-approvers-group → reviewers-one`\n\nNext, create working and not working rules in the project under **Settings \u003e General \u003e Merge Request Approvals**\n\n1. Working Rule\n\n- Rule name: \"Working Rule\"\n- Target branch: `main`\n- Approvals required: 1\n- Add approvers: `Parent/subgroup`\n\n2. Not Working Rule\n\n- Rule name: \"Not Working Rule\"\n- Target branch: `main`\n- Approvals required: 1\n- Add approvers: `Parent/subgroup/code-approvers-group/reviewers-one`\n\nMost GitLab team members can [check the settings in the example project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/benjaminking/broken-approvals/project/edit).\n\nIf using Self-Managed, enable the feature flag with `Feature.enable(:subgroups_approval_rules)`, then follow the above steps.\n\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/benjaminking/broken-approvals\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nApproval rules referencing the subgroup are not applied, with the rule marked as \"complete\", and not showing group members: \n\n![image](/uploads/81fc72ec2e6faaaa4af287ae734faa55/image.png)\n\nAdditionally, the label for the approvals shows 2 approvals are required for the *working* rule: \n\n![image](/uploads/6033bb007e2b631769f8d008f8fc449b/image.png)\n\n### Workaround\n\nThe current workaround appears to be to set `Prevent editing approval rules in merge requests`, which stops this from happening during MR creation.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe approval rule referencing the subgroup should be applied, to ensure there is a level of oversight on approvals for merging code.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nProvided above where applicable :smile:","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-18T04:40:55.539Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T14:04:18.580Z","closed_at":"2022-09-09T09:29:44.482Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","customer","devops::create","group::source code","section::dev","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":10369602,"username":"benjaminking","name":"Ben King","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10369602/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benjaminking"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371106","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371106","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371106/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371106/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371106","relative":"#371106","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371106"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8499,"epic":{"id":576856,"iid":8499,"title":"Approval rules configuration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8499","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113432928,"iid":371099,"project_id":278964,"title":"GitHub Importer: API for bulk import of personal gists to personal snippets","description":"### Release notes\n\nWith GitHub Importer, you could import GitHub repositories to GitLab, however there was no possibility to import gists as well. Now you can use a new public API endpoint to bulk-import your [personal gists](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/gists/gists#list-gists-for-the-authenticated-user) into [your personal GitLab Snippets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html#create-snippets) visible on [Snippets Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/snippets).\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWe can import repos from GitHub, but for a more complete migration away from GitHub, we would need to have a way to import GitHub Gists as well.\n\nWith the release of [Snippets with multiple Files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14340), it is now possible to migrate GitHub Gists (up to 10 files) directly into GitLab Snippets. As we haven't had any requests to increase that limit in the product and allow snippets to have more files, we won't try to make that possible with import either.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a public API for a bulk import of personal gists [created by the person](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/gists/gists#list-gists-for-the-authenticated-user) into [their personal GitLab Snippets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html#create-snippets) visible on [Snippets Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/snippets):\n\n* public gists become public visibility level snippets\n* secret gists become private visibility level snippets.\n\n### Technical details \n\nIf gist description is present, we use it as the snippet title (attention: Gist description has a limit

This integration still allows for changing the URL and leaking the configured access token.\n\nThis makes it possible for a malicious user(maintainer) to change the server to a user controlled server, where the attacker can then extract the token. The attacker needs maintainer access to the project, but should nevertheless not have access to the configured access token. The impact is the same as for my previous reports. I did mention this issue in the original report but I guess it slipped through.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nMake sure to have a webhook server where you can see incoming requests. I use https://webhook.site for my tests\n\nYou will need to generate a project with mirrored repository from Github for the integration to be enabled. So I will first describe that.\n\n1. Log in to github.com (note: GITHUB)  \n2. Create a repository, name it anything  \n3. Create an API token with \"repo\" scope, https://github.com/settings/tokens\n\nThen on GITLAB:\n\n1. Create two users `victim` and `attacker`  \n2. Log in as `victim`, and create a new project. Make sure to UNCHECK \"initialize with README\"  \n3. Go to https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/project_members  \n4. Invite `attacker` as a maintainer to the project  \n5. Go to https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/settings/repository and expand \"Mirroring repositories\"\"  \n6.  Configure both a PUSH and a PULL mirroring, enter URL as https://USERNAME@github.com/REPOPATH and the generated API token as password. Make sure to check all boxes (I dont know what is needed, check everything)  \n7. Now go to https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/settings/integrations/github/edit  \n8. fill in the access token `HIDDEN_TOKEN` and GitHub repo https://github.com/anything/anything  \n9. Click save, the token field should turn empty  \n10. Log in with `attacker`   \n11. Go to https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/settings/integrations/github/edit  \n12. Enter a new value for server URL using the catch server  \n13. Click `Test settings`  \n14. Go to the catch server and see that a request have been received with the token in plain text\n\nIf the \"Test settings\" button is missing, there is something wrong with the repo mirroring.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nUser with maintainer access can leak the configured GitHub access token.

With it enabled only MRs targeting `main` or `master` branch while calculating Lead Time For Changes metric. To reduce scope of this PoC several assumptions and simplifications has been made:\n\n1. No data migration is supported. All old data will stay as it was before enabling feature flag and only new gathered data will be calculated with new approach. Same applies to disabling feature flag.\n2. No UI for configuration is required. Hardcoded configuration should mark `main` and `master` as target branch to filter out project MRs.\n3. Only project level should be supported for now. No propagation to group level is required.\n\n/cc @blabuschagne","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-17T15:18:56.136Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T12:01:49.430Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T17:25:34.379Z","closed_by":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"labels":["Category:DevOps Reports","Category:Metrics","Deliverable","auto updated","backend","devops::plan","feature::enhancement","group::optimize","missed-deliverable","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"}],"author":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371029","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371029","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371029/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371029/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371029","relative":"#371029","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371029"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8334,"epic":{"id":560559,"iid":8334,"title":"DORA 4 Metrics API Support - Complete Maturity","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8334","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113411144,"iid":371028,"project_id":278964,"title":"Capture Work Item Widget Metadata decisions in the docs page","description":"Decisions were made about Widget Metadata structure during the implementation of tasks.

Helm is likely the most popular Kubernetes packaging tool. Until now, the agent for Kubernetes only supported vanilla Kubernetes manifest files for its GitOps workflow. Helm users had to use a CI job to render and commit the resources to benefit from the GitOps workflow. \n\nThe current release ships with Alpha support for Helm in the agent. As Helm is a mature product, we consider the solution performant but has a few [known limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/gitops/helm.html#known-issues), and the API might change without prior notice. We welcome your feedback in [the related epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7938), where we discuss future improvements and next steps.\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-17T14:15:24.758Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T14:27:14.225Z","closed_at":"2022-09-10T22:04:21.339Z","closed_by":{"id":4545061,"username":"nagyv-gitlab","name":"Viktor Nagy (GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb255c1e9c228b9356af165939b3ac9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nagyv-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Kubernetes Management","GitLab Free","devops::configure","direction","documentation","group::configure","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":4855585,"username":"ash2k","name":"Mikhail Mazurskiy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3161684bd29f5016064a6c16ccd3bc7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ash2k"}],"author":{"id":4545061,"username":"nagyv-gitlab","name":"Viktor Nagy (GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb255c1e9c228b9356af165939b3ac9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nagyv-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4855585,"username":"ash2k","name":"Mikhail Mazurskiy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3161684bd29f5016064a6c16ccd3bc7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ash2k"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371019","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371019","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371019/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371019/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371019","relative":"#371019","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371019"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7938,"epic":{"id":507942,"iid":7938,"title":"Support of templating tools (kustomize, kpt, helm)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7938","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113403171,"iid":371013,"project_id":278964,"title":"Compliance Framework – Update settings","description":"Brought up in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339887#note_1067537267 we should consider to update how the Compliance frameworks are presented in the settings.

an implementation plan for Container Registry active database load balancing","description":"## Context\n\nThis is part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8591. Before implementing active database load balancing, we must devise a plan and validate its feasibility. That's the purpose of this issue.\n\nThere is yet no support for the registry database on self-managed installs. We're first completing the GitLab.com upgrade/migration (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523). Support for self-managed will happen later (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5521).\n\nThe ideal solution would fit both self-managed and GitLab.com use cases, but, considering that:\n\n- There is not yet support for self-managed, so we do not have any kind of insight about usage/performance there to decide whether or not load-balancing would be beneficial a first step might be a simplified approach that fits well with the GitLab.com architecture.\n\n## Background\n\nOn GitLab.com, the registry database is hosted on a dedicated PostgreSQL cluster (v12 at the time of writing)  comprised of a primary server and multiple replica servers. The primary and the pool of replicas sit behind separate Consul DNS names for easy discoverability and load balancing:\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/uploads/2ae96e0e2a8c39923798ca8a5cf7b6f2/image.png)\n\n## Problem\n\nWe currently support [multi-host connections](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-MULTIPLE-HOSTS) for failover, but we do not support active load-balancing to send read-only queries to a read-only replica whenever possible.\n\nFor availability and performance reasons, we should be able to perform active load-balancing.\n\n## Solution\n\n## Implementation Plan","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-17T12:39:38.663Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:04:37.273Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T15:08:48.258Z","closed_by":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","database","devops::package","golang","group::package registry","performance-refinement","reliability","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"}],"author":{"id":9516393,"username":"michelletorres","name":"Michelle Torres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9516393/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michelletorres"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371003","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371003","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371003/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371003/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371003","relative":"#371003","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371003"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":114300945,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113399520,"iid":371002,"project_id":278964,"title":"Track MR survey dismissals","description":"From https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366561#note_1051342590.\n\nHaving the response rate of the in-product MR survey will allow us to put the responses into context and understand how well the survey is performing.

aggregation definition","description":"## Background\n\nBecause Redis[metric aggregation feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/implement.html#aggregated-metrics) was created before `merics yml definitions` and this caused legacy duplication and distribution of information. Event can be aggregated into metric with 3 of following ways:\n1. Total metrics - already [deprecated feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/implement.html#known-events-are-added-automatically-in-service-data-payload), yet still used by [some older metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/hll_redis_counter.rb#L21)\n2. Aggregated metrics - via yaml config files at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/metrics/aggregates and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/config/metrics/aggregates\n3. Metric yaml definition - via `option.events` \n\nThis makes create confusing experience for developers, and makes it harder to utilize aggregation information for any downstream systems as discussed at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370462#note_1067324388\n\n## Goal\n\nUnify way of defining metrics aggregation, possibly remove all other methods and adjust metrics yaml definition files to be able to convey information about metrics aggregation including both redis and database sources as well as union and intersection operators (`AND` and `OR`)\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Migrate remaining total metrics instrumentation to metrics yaml definitions, this work is related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368996 and can be covered by it\n1. Add support for metrics aggreggation [attributes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/implement.html#aggregated-metrics) to metrics yaml definitions\n1. Add existing aggregated metrics definitions to metrics yaml definitions\n1. Change agggregated metrics implementation to read from metrics yamls definitions https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/usage/metrics/aggregates.rb#L10\n1. Remove legacy aggregated metrics definitions\n1. Add information about counted attribute to metrics yaml definition\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ePrevious implementation plan\u003c/summary\u003e\n1. Migrate remaining total metrics instrumentation to metrics yaml definitions, this work is related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368996 and can be covered by it\n2. Enhance metrics yaml definitions and aggregated metrics feature to use metrics yaml as source for aggregated metrics definition\n   1. ~~Add support for metrics aggregation [attributes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/implement.html#aggregated-metrics) to metrics yaml definitions~~ moved to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373830\n   2.

request before merging","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nProtected branches in GitLab are implemented differently than in GitHub. For example, in GitHub there are some protected rules that you can apply on one or a few branches that match an expression, while those rules exist in GitLab as a general project settings for all branches.

in their container/VM, and output a GitLab WebIDE URL and a password.\n- This URL will contain parameters like the hostname of the VM(in the case of containers, we'd need to figure out some more networking items) and the port of the VS Code server.\n- The user will click on the link and in the browser, the user will enter the password(connection token with which the VS code server was started) and the GitLab WebIDE will be instantiated with the above parameters. \n\nThese are **not** part of the Spike:\n\n- Advanced IDE features like linting unless we have the ability to install

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369882#note_1057880373\n\nIn our first iteration of `Child items` there are a few challenges:\n- Only `Tasks` are displayed and addable within this widget\n- There is no clear open/close `Task` icon or validated way to display this status separated from indictor of work item type (used to be an open/close icon)\n- There is no clear way to indicate type of item within this widget and `issue type` icons are receiving feedback and may need to be iterated on. \n   - To the above point, there are only tasks in this widget anyway meaning it should be clearly labeled as such.\n   - We currently rely on the `Add a task` button to demonstrate type when clearer labeling would be the preferred solution.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Change the title of this widget from [-Child items-] to [+Tasks+] (for now) until we add other types to this widget and sort out some of the above challenges\n1.

The Incident Budget Explorer dashboard can help here.\n- Include the number of times alerts have fired owing to the problem, how much time was spent dealing with the problem, and how many people were involved.\n- Link to affected incidents, and cross-reference them as related issues.\n- Include screenshots of visualization from Grafana or Kibana.\n- Always include a permalink to the source of the screenshot so that others can investigate further.\n--\u003e\n\nWhen this happens, customers.gitlab.com becomes unavailable.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\u003c!--\nProvide a clear, unambiguous, self-contained solution to the problem.\n--\u003e\n\n`customers-01-inf-prdsub` hosts many different processes related to the customers service, including postgres, puma, and sidekiq workers.\n\nWe should isolate these processes to avoid any single one from consuming unlimited amounts of CPU or memory.\n\nThis can be done by applying cgroup limits on the systemd units. The [systemd resource control](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html) parameters we can use are: `CPUQuota`, `MemoryMax`.\n\n## Verification\n\u003c!--\nProvide a method for validating that the original issue still exists.\n\nHaving a way of checking validity can save on a great deal of back-and-forth discussion between Infradev Triage participants including Engineering Managers, Directors and Product Managers and make space for other non-resolved issues to get scheduled sooner.\n\nIdeally, provide a link to a Thanos query or an ELK query and clear instructions on how to interpret the results to determine whether the problem is still occurring.\n--\u003e\n\nIt's a little difficult to verify, since this only impacts the service when one process starts consuming too many resources.

This data would help drive prioritization and investment in the Container Registry category.\n\nThe high-level plan for delivering this was outlined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364730#note_1058520288. This specific issue is part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9234+, which targets the \"Process\" stage of the outlined implementation plan.\n\n## Task - Investigation\n\nAs described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364730#note_1058520288, the first step is to process the already emitted (by the registry) and consumed (by Rails) registry webhook notifications for tag delete/create requests. This needs to be done on the Rails side.\n\nThese notifications already include the type of event, the target container repository, and the username. So they have all that Rails needs to consume and increment the respective (new) counters to track usage.\n\nThis issue is meant to be an **investigation** on how to implement the collection and processing of these events on the ~rails side to increment (new) counters for usage tracking.\n\nThe end goal is to count the number of users that have created or deleted container registry tags. It should be possible to aggregate these counters by month and week, so that we can know how many distinct users created/deleted tags per month and week.\n\nFor scalability reasons, this should likely be implemented with Redis counters, similar to how it was done for package registry events in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/275942+. Since this was done a few years ago, we should make sure this is still the best option. We should also involve Product Analysts in this conversation (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364730#note_1027217479).","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T05:18:36.485Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T05:36:12.463Z","closed_at":"2022-12-14T21:02:26.250Z","closed_by":{"id":4082686,"username":"jaime","name":"Jaime Martinez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4082686/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jaime"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Package:P2","Stretch","backend","devops::package","feature::addition","group::container registry","needs investigation","rails","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":4082686,"username":"jaime","name":"Jaime Martinez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4082686/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jaime"},{"id":12695021,"username":"adie.po","name":"Adie Po","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12695021/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adie.po"}],"author":{"id":9516393,"username":"michelletorres","name":"Michelle Torres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9516393/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michelletorres"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4082686,"username":"jaime","name":"Jaime Martinez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4082686/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jaime"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382524","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/382524","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/382524/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/382524/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#382524","relative":"#382524","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#382524"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9234,"epic":{"id":653718,"iid":9234,"title":"Container Registry AMAU -
