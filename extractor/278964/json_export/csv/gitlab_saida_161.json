[{"id":27671368,"iid":37481,"project_id":278964,"title":"Container Registry: Optimize garbage collection for GCS","description":"### Problem to solve\nThe GitLab Container Registry allows developers to build, push and share Docker images/tags using the Docker client and/or GitLab CI/CD. \n\nFor organizations that build many images across many projects, it is important to regularly remove old, unused images and tags. The container registry [garbage collection](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/#container-registry-garbage-collection) process takes a long time to run and is inefficient. This makes it impossible for instances with large amounts of storage usage to run the process and results in expensive, inefficient usage of storage. \n\n### Intended customers\n- Self-managed customers that schedule down time for the registry and run garbage collection, but not for more than 4 hours. \n\n### Intended users\n- [Systems Administrator](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-devon)\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sasha)\n\n### Proposal\nOptimize the container registry garbage collection process to run faster and enable our customers to clean-up their registry and lower the cost of storage. \n\n### Further details\n\n\n#### Use cases\n- I as an administrator, when I am running garbage collection to clean out old images/tags from the container registry which contains more than 500 GB of storage, need to be able to run garbage collection in less than four hours, so that I can optimize storage without sacrificing productivity of my organization's engineering teams.  \n\n#### Benefits\n- Optimizing the code will serve as a stepping stone to delivering in-line garbage collection and allow us to unblock some of our customers. \n- Our large self-managed customers will be able to lower their cost of storage and improve the discoverability of their container registry. \n- Small to mid-sized self-managed customers will be able to run garbage collection with less down time and a less disruptive process. \n\n\n#### Optimization vs. enabling on-line garbage collection\n- The garbage collection process currently requires the container registry being set to read-only mode or being shut down. \n- On-line garbage collection, without requiring down time, is the direction we would like/need to go. \n- However, now that we have [forked Docker Registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30925) it makes sense to first optimize the existing code, which baed on some early feedback is rather inefficient. This should help unblock some of our larger customers from running garbage collection.\n- Then we will enable [online garbage collection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/26818), which will allow it to run in the background and prevent downtime entirely. But as that work requires more effort, we are prioritizing that second. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n- As with the existing garbage collection command, this should be limited to administrators only. \n\n### Documentation\n- [Container Registry Maintenance Commands](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/#container-registry-garbage-collection)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like we see a 50% improvement in how long the process takes for our customers. We can measure this by working with the several organizations that have requested this optimization and evaluating if it met their needs. \n- Track number of times the command is run and how long the process took each time. \n\n### Links / references\n- [Docker Distribution Garbage Collection

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/63825 that we saw before.\n\nI suspect that this is due to the \"Backport EE Schema\" migration that adds / removes 30 columns to `application_settings`.\n\nEvery time we run a migration spec for a migration before the EE backport migration, we drop the 30 columns and then add them back after the test.\n\nWe may want to look into @nick.thomas' suggestion in the previous issue:\n\n\u003e :thinking: I wonder if using the `transaction` strategy for migration specs would work. Postgres respects transactions around DDL statements, and we don't have to support mysql any more, so it might be worth looking into. The question is whether it would continue to use up slots towards that 1600 limit or not.\n\nNote: Parallelism was increased in https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/1498 as a short-term fix to this issue.\n\ncc @twk3 @kwiebers","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-27T04:04:06.170Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T08:59:13.948Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T18:36:34.382Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","Quality","ci-build","database","master:broken","master:needs-investigation","priority::1","severity::1","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"}],"author":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37417","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/37417","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/37417/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/37417/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#37417","relative":"#37417","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#37417"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27600557,"iid":37403,"project_id":278964,"title":"npm install fails with CI_JOB_TOKEN in .npmrc","description":"### Summary\n\nZD: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/139850 (internal)\n\n`npm install` with `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in `.npmrc` returns 401\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n#### In `@namespace/package1`:\n\n* Publish `@namespace/package1`\n* Use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in `.npmrc`: \n`//gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cyour_project_id\u003e/packages/npm/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}`\n\n#### In `@namespace/package2`:\n\n* Add `@namespace/package1` as dependency in `package2`'s `package.json`\n* Either create an `.npmrc` in the root directory, or create it in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n* Create step in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to run `npm install`\n* Response is 401\n\n### Example Project\nOutput from my test project is a 401 when using `CI_JOB_TOKEN`\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/sahbabou/npm-test-project/-/jobs/362215893\n\nSuccess when using PAT:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/sahbabou/npm-test-project/pipelines/98809455\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUnable to install packages when using `CI_JOB_TOKEN` \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUsers with the appropriate permissions should be able to install NPM packages with `CI_JOB_TOKEN`\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```\nnpm ERR! code E401\n27 npm ERR! 401 Unauthorized - GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/@sahbabou%2ftest-package\n28 npm ERR!

We need to allow easy downloading of Binary Files. After we support binary files in Releases (#35893), we should aim to improve the user experience of the single file zip.  \n\n* if you compile phar(/exe/binary) files, they are already compressed so you gain nothing from ziping them again\n* you need to unzip them on the target server which requires zip to be installed\n* In comparsion to Github, they allow to add binary files as assets without the forced zipping\n* i can't control which compression is used, sometimes a user will want to use tar.gz or bzip2 instead if zip\n* if you are stuck at old puppet modules like https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/wget they simply can't unzip\n\ninstead of\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/1.8.6/composer.phar\n```\n\nyou have to\n\n```\nwget -q -O tmp.zip https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/1.8.6/composer.phar.zip \u0026\u0026 unz\n```\n\n### Intended users\n\nMostly, the technical release managers will be using this feature: \n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n* **Use Case**: A user should be able to easily download a file without having it to be zipped \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n* Allow bin files to be added as assets without forced zipping\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n* All single binary files should be included in this\n* User permissions should be inherited from project/roles to download the binary files \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n* [Currently Supported Release Assets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#release-assets)\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n* when downloaded, single binary files should not be zipped \n* when downloaded, multiple binary files should be zipped \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n* Time spent downloading binary files should be reduced\n* Consumption of server space should be minimized as a result of not needing to establish a target server to unzip files \n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

But I keep getting the 400 bad request error. I just followed the tutorial on: https://docs.gitlab.com/12.5/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/index.html\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1.  Create a gitlab repo\n2.  Initialize node project\n3.  Add the following to the package.json\n```\n\"publishConfig\": {\n    \"@\u003cYOUR_ORGANIZATION\u003e:registry\": \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cyour_project_id\u003e/packages/npm/\"\n  }\n```\n4.  Create a .npmrc file where the following code needs to be added\n```\n//gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=\u003cYOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\u003e\n//gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cYOUR_PROJECT_ID\u003e/packages/npm/:_authToken=\u003cYOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\u003e\n@\u003cYOUR_ORGANIZATION\u003e:registry=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/\nalways-auth=true\n```\n5.

This issue would add the ability to create reusable domains with SSL support at the project level.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nPrereq: Instance level checklist complete: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/195961\n- [ ] UI: Under Settings \u003e Operations, there is a new Project-level settings panel section\n- [ ] UI: Within this new section, User can add a new domain\n- [ ] UI: Within this new section, User can add a new SSL cert\n- [ ] BE: Project level domains and SSL certs have own controller/actions/routes\n- [ ] BE: Project level domains and SSL certs reuse DB tables from Instance level\n- [ ] BE: GitLab Knative application logic selects all available domains (instance level + project level)\n\n## Solution\n\nWe'll create a new settings area under `Project \u003e Settings \u003e Operations` and provide the following fields:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-12-06_at_11.09.45_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/6d2df6da3f0d52a026c952fcd6372697/Screen_Shot_2019-12-06_at_11.09.45_AM.png)\n\nAll fields are required. We throw a validation if the field is not filled out.\n\n#### Verifying a domain\n\nOnce the domain is added, we provide a CNAME record and verification key. We also show whether the domain is verified in a badge and allow the user to refresh the verification status.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-02-06_at_12.11.51_PM](/uploads/465ff32bec12677711c32b3b8087a7c0/Screen_Shot_2020-02-06_at_12.11.51_PM.png)\n\n#### Updating a certificate\n\nWe also show the certificate, and the user has the ability to update the certificate. If they do choose to update it, then the UI remains the same, but the certificate section show the Cert and Key fields instead (same as pages).\n\nIf the user updates the fields the certificate, the `Save changes` button becomes enabled. The user must add the new cert + key. If it remains blank and they try to save, we throw a validation. If a new cert is not added and they navigate away, then the old cert remains.\n\n#### Selecting a domain at the cluster level\n\nOn the cluster page, we will provide an option to either select the existing domain or utilize a new one. This mimics the pattern we are using for protected branches.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-11-25_at_12.07.35_PM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/77aaa6f4dab2422ee67b9c8f31c6a5fc/Screen_Shot_2019-11-25_at_12.07.35_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-11-25_at_12.07.20_PM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/92be075da01aa3d9412001ba63d9b1f7/Screen_Shot_2019-11-25_at_12.07.20_PM.png)\n\n#### Deleting domain\n\nDeleting domain follows same pattern determined for instance level domains (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35591)\n\n## Reach\n\nTODO: we need real users behind this issue.\n\n\u003c!-- Please describe who suffers from this problem.

This makes it hard for a user to verify whether or not the vulnerability is a false positive.\n\nThe issues #37027 and #36332 propose displaying vulnerability evidence on the Security Dashboard/Pipeline/MR widgets. Any data added to the DAST report to facilitate building these issues will likely not adhere to the Common Report Format. This should be addressed in this issue, that is, an output of this issue should be evidence fields that adhere to the Common Report Format.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nEach `vulnerability` in the DAST JSON report should contain an `evidence` field. `evidence` should be an object, as we expect this to include other fields in future (e.g. `request`, `response`). The object should contain a field, `summary`:\n\n```json\n\"vulnerabilities\": [\n   {\n     ...\n     \"evidence\":               {\n       \"summary\":  \"378282246310005; Credit Card Type detected: American Express\"\n     }\n   }\n]\n```\n\nSummary should be made up of the ZAP `alerts[].instances[].evidence` and the ZAP `alerts.otherinfo`.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ePrevious proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nOne possible implementation of this might be that we include an `evidence` field in each vulnerability. Of course, what information is required in the evidence field is yet to be determined. For DAST, in theory the entire request/response will be useful. \n\n```json\n\"vulnerabilities\": [\n   {\n     ...\n     \"evidence\":               {\n       \"summary\":  \"378282246310005; Credit Card Type detected: American Express\",\n       \"request\":  {\n         \"headers\":      [\n           {\n             \"name\":  \"Host\",\n             \"value\": \"www.my-target.com\"\n           }\n         ],\n         \"http_version\": \"1.1\",\n         \"method\":       \"GET\",\n         \"url\":          \"http://www.my-target.com/fun-times?query=events\"\n       },\n       \"response\": {\n         \"headers\":       [\n           {\n             \"name\":  \"Content-Type\",\n             \"value\": \"text/html;charset=UTF-8\"\n           }\n         ],\n         \"http_version\":  \"1.1\",\n         \"reason_phrase\": \"OK\",\n         \"status_code\":   \"200\"\n       }\n     }\n]\n```\n\nAnother option is for the request/response fields to adhere to the [HAR format](https://w3c.github.io/web-performance/specs/HAR/Overview.html).\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Implementation\n\nWhen a vulnerability is found, ZAP produces in the JSON output the following properties:\n- `alert.otherinfo`: More information related to the context of the vulnerability. This is set by each vulnerability rule, so it use varies. Examples: \n  - `\u003cp\u003eCredit Card Type detected: American Express\u003c/p\u003e`\n  - `\u003cp\u003eFailed to connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eZAP attempted to connect via: https://vulnerabletestserver:443/\u003c/p\u003e`\n  - `\u003cp\u003eNOTE: Because of its name this cookie may be important, but dropping it appears to have no effect: [JSESSIONID] \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCookies that don't have expected effects can reveal flaws in application logic. In the worst case, this can reveal where authentication via cookie token(s) is not actually enforced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese cookies affected the response: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese cookies did NOT affect the response: JSESSIONID\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e`\n- `alert.instances[].evidence`. A specific value to help users know more about the issue. This is also set by each vulnerability, so its use also varies. Examples: \n  - `378282246310005`\n  - `\u003cform method=\"POST\" style=\"width: 200px;\" action=\"/WebGoat/login\"\u003e`\n  - `Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID`\n\nThe new field, `evidence.summary`, should be made up with the following logic:\n- `evidence.summary` := `alerts[].instances[].evidence`; `alerts[].otherinfo`.\n- If there is no `evidence` or `otherinfo`, then the fields do not need to be separated by `;`\n- HTML tags should be stripped from `alerts[].otherinfo`\n- Superfluous whitespace should be removed\n\n### Out of scope\n\n- Adding the `request`/`response` to `evidence`.

However, they do not discuss the user interface, what features are available, how to use the UI to gain information about packages, and what to do when something isn't working.  \n\nAs we build out additional features that are outside of the publish/install workflow (package verification, automatic package creation, automatic .npmrc files, etc), we should create a new area of documentation that is more universal for all package managers in how to utilize these features.\n\n### Intended users\n* [Parker (Product

the GitLab application get up to speed quickly and find help when they need it.\n- By documenting how to use the UI, we will drive usage and get better feedback on how to improve the overall user experience. \n\n\n### Proposal\nAdd a new section to the Package Registry documentation that details how to use the interface to:\n- Enable the feature using the UI (include screenshots)\n- Navigate to and find a package\n- Understand/use the available metadata\n- Download files\n- Delete packages\n- How to tell how much storage is being used for each Package Registry \n- Troubleshooting\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes required for this feature.\n\n### Documentation\n- Update the Package registry documentation.\n\n### What does success look like, and how

Auto DevOps with no overrides.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project on GitLab.com within a Gold subscribed namespace that's based on an application.\n1. Create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE through **Operations -\u003e Kubernetes** using the default options.\n1. Install Tiller, Ingress, and GitLab Runner through GitLab Managed Apps.\n1. Set a base domain, using nip.io if necessary.\n1. Enable Auto DevOps.\n1. Run a pipeline.\n1. Observe the failure of the `dast_environment_deploy` job.

Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\nCurrently `DS_DISABLE_DIND` and `SAST_DISABLED_DIND` are `false` by default. These are set in [Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) and

compatible with non-DinD mode: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211621~~\n- [x] announce the change and deprecate DinD mode, to be dropped in %\"13.0\" (next major):

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31589\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] document changes in project detection (job conditions) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211694\n- [x] group Docker-in-Docker related variables in SAST and DS, for clarity https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29045\n- [x]

Dependency Scanning QA to use non-DinD setup https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36526\n- [ ] update SAST QA to use test projects, and non-DinD setup https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33724\n\n### Risks\n\n- If the QA for the legacy DinD setup is missing or incomplete, this might be leading to a regression in SAST and DS when running the DinD setup, which would affect old versions of GitLb.\n- If there's a discrepancy in project detection, a project might get new vulnerabilities users don't want, or lose vulnerabilities it used to have.\n- If there's a discrepancy in vulnerability tracking or merging, the vulnerabilities might change in the UI, and vulnerability feedback might be lost.\n\nTo be investigated:\n\n- [x] Make sure the change doesn't results in new vulnerabilities https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213839\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSAST and Dependency Scanning default to the setup where each scanner runs in its own CI job, and there's no Docker-in-Docker orchestrator anymore.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links /

implemented [Specify variables when running a manual job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/24935) provided an ability to specify additional job parameters when running a manual job via

Import via API.","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrent implementation of the transfer of file from client to the server\ndoes not use Workhorse acceleration of uploads that performs direct upload\nto the object storage.\n\nGiven that export archives are usually big, very often in range of 100MB-5GB\nwe very often hit Unicorn timeouts. Unicorn is configured to run request\nfor as much as 60s, which very often is not enough to transfer the archive\nfrom the disk to remote storage.\n\nCurrently, the process is as follow:\n1. Request get accepted by Workhorse,\n2. Workhorse intercepts the request and streams the file to shared on-disk uploads storage,\n3. Workhorse rewrites the request body, to include a link to path on shared on-disk storage,\n4. Rails creates a new project,\n5. The default storage for all uploads is configured to object storage,\n6. Given that created file is stored on disk, the file is transfered in Rails to object storage,\n7. Given that this file is of substantial size, it might take even a few minutes.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe have a well figured out direct-upload in Workhorse, which allows us to stream the file\ndirectly to Object Storage, without storing that on-disk.\n\nImport feature should use direct-upload, similarly how it is being used by Artifacts upload\nand Packages upload.\n\nRails, would not have to transfer the file from disk to object storage, the only cheap operation\nthat Rails would do is to move file from temporary location in OS, to persistent location in OS.\nWe do that extensively for artifacts today, and this works great.

That's possibly a side-effect of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37237.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe MR is NOT blocked. The approval widget says `No approval required`, even though there's a `Vulnerability-Check` group.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe MR is BLOCKED. Ideally, the error is explicit about the misconfiguration of the security scanning, in the source branch contributors are submitting.\n \n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Capture_d_écran_2019-11-25_à_10.20.09](/uploads/9f508b56a25da3ec2488be365694aef7/Capture_d_écran_2019-11-25_à_10.20.09.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWe can compare report types for pipeline from MR and target branch.

haven't deployed in ages, so haven't checked recently if it works. When I go now, I get a insecure website warning, that the certificate has expired a month ago already. I received no warning and when I visit the Pages settings in that repo nothing is indicated there's an error.\n\nThat itself is an issue, but I then checked list of certificates issued for my domain, and there has been a certificate issued in September, but it's not used... (https://crt.sh/?q=bachelors-thesis.mikulaspoul.cz)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a project with Pages with a custom domain and enable Let's Encrypt\n2. Don't deploy for 3 months and one day\n3. See the website (will have expired certificate)\n4. Look up the custom domain on https://crt.sh/ (should have a new certificate which isn't used)\n\n### Example Project\n\nIt happens on https://gitlab.com/mikulaspoul/bachelor-thesis, but not strictly an example project\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAfter 3 months the page becomes insecure (serves insecure certificate).\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAfter 3 months the page still serves a secure certificate.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/5bff187dea0cdb35a566fb47f1e9c0f3/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/1e2baabbff3966389764da52b5446de9/image.png)\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Workaround\n\nDisable auto-ssl for the domain, save the form, enable it and save the form again.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-23T15:34:29.370Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T11:56:01.386Z","closed_at":"2020-04-21T11:56:01.335Z","closed_by":{"id":3379682,"username":"vshushlin","name":"Vladimir Shushlin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3379682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshushlin"},"labels":["Category:Pages","Release::P3","cicd::active","devops::release","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

The container restarts several times, likely failing readiness checks.  [We should improve our readinessProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) to ensure there are no such restarts and a proper delay is given.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nDeploy ingress `gitlab-managed-app`\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/defend/waf-enablement-demo/\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nInstallation of ingress results in several restarts when spinning up sidecar logging container\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nInstallation of ingress should occur

Secure fixtures for local development","description":"Fixtures for development that we have right now don't provide useful data for local development: only SAST vulnerabilities are created and only 20 of them. \nThat leads to the fact that engineers have to set up runner and run CI jobs locally to get the data that they need for their work process. This is not efficient for the next reasons:\n1. Running jobs takes time\n2. GDK + Runner can be unstable so people end up fixing their local environment instead of developing new features.\n\nThe fact that there are fixtures only for SAST leads to the fact that features such as `Dependency list` and `License Compliance` can't be tested. Since only items of `Vulnerabilities::Occurrence` are created, without reports, it also breaks testing of `Project Security Dashboard`.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n1. Add fixtures for Dependency Scanning and License Compliance report\n2. Add fixtures for different security vulnerabilities (with auto-fix solutions, with dependency list) + license compliance findings.\n3. Add license compliance policies to projects.\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\n**Data for `Vulnerability Report` page:**\n1. Create a new `ee/db/fixtures/development/number_items.rb` file to create needed development fixtures.\n1. In this file create pipeline with dependency_scanning trait `create(:ee_ci_pipeline, :dependency_scanning)\n1. Pipeline contains artifacts that needed to be parsed in the same way as it's done in production using `StoreReportService`.\n1. Check `Vulnerability Report` and individual vulnerability pages to ensure that data is set up correctly.\n\n**Data for `Dependency List` and `License Compliance` page**\n1.  Create `JobArtifact` that has `dependency_scanning` report `create(:ee_ci_job_artifact, :dependency_list)`. Assign it to the `dependency_scanning` job in the latest pipeline.\n1.   Add to the same pipeline `license_scanning` job and add JobArtifact of `license_scanning` type  `create(:ee_ci_job_artifact, :license_scanning)`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-22T16:53:05.117Z","updated_at":"2022-07-01T13:40:51.570Z","closed_at":"2022-07-01T13:40:51.542Z","closed_by":{"id":1378158,"username":"brytannia","name":"Tetiana Chupryna","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1378158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brytannia"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::workflow","missed-deliverable","missed:14.1","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We will move forward in a few stages to accomplish this. \n\n### Problem to Solve\n\n\u003e When I'm trying to coordinate strategy across many project teams, I want to see project level initiatives grouped together and viewable on some sort of timeline, so that I can track progress and understand what is coming up and what is currently in flight.\n\n### MVC Proposed Solution:\n* ~\"GitLab Premium\" users will have Group Level Epics\n* Group Level Epics should be accessible in the same fashion they are for ~\"GitLab Ultimate\". (Left hand nav items, Epic lists, etc)\n* Group level epics cannot have sub-epics nested under them, only issues within the Group\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* Increase in upgrades to Premium\n* Overall # of Epic created at Group level\n\n### Documentation \n\nWe need to update our [Epic docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics) to state the availability in `Premium` and to clearly state that `Premium` users can not nest children epics like `Ultimate` users can in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#relationships-between-epics-and-issues and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#multi-level-child-epics. \n\n### Proposed Breakdown\n\n#### Backend\n\n1. Add `subepics` flag to ulitmate license together with existing `epics` [ee/app/models/license.rb#L113](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/models/license.rb#L113)\n1.

Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace *all* the (parenthesized) sections below with the pertinent details. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\n\n### Summary\n\nAuthentication via Oauth2 Web application flow grants authorization code for non(email)verified users.   \nGitlab doesn't care about the user's verification state, authorizes Oauth requests without checking the authenticity of the user's primary identifier (email). \n\n- One can enter a non existing email address while sign up on Gitlab.com. (correct)  \n- At this point the user has a Gitlab account logged in on gitlab.com. The gitlab user is not yet (email) verified though. (correct)  \n- When the user requests Oauth authorization from a web application Gitlab authorizes it and claims the user is real. (vulnerability)  \n- After the redirect the Web application the user receives the authorization code without any warning, status.  (vulnerability)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Start an Oauth Web Application Flow in an incognito window (no active gitlab sessions) from a previously registered oauth application.   \n2. Register a new  Gitlab account with a non existing / fake email https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in  \n3. Gitlab authorizes the Oauth authorization request and returns with the authorization code.\n\n### Impact\n\n1. Gitlab Oauth authorizes non verified. possibly fake users with (possibly fake) email addresses.   \nEg. random@random.com, tim@apple.com\n\n2. Gitlab claims tim@apple.com or random@random.com are valid users and returns with the email addresses when scope=read_user+profile requested from a web app. (after the succesful authorization). \n\n3. Gitlab as Oauth Provider compromises millions of web applications around the world. The vulnerability affects all Oauth clients which are trusting Gitlab as a social authentication provider. Many of these web applications expecting that Gitlab authorization fails with non-verified users and does not allow api access  for user with possibly fake unique identifiers (email addresses).  \n\n### Examples\n\nNot project related. Please just follow the steps above. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOauth authorization SUCCESS.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen a primary email address for a user account has not been verified, Oauth authorization should FAIL. \n\nSimilar Oauth flow on Github.com and many other Oauth providers fail. With those providers it's not possible to use not yet verified accounts for Oauth flows. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n1. - [Screenshot_2019-11-21_at_17.32.21.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/d17326ae-66a5-48d4-a3c2-3ccc41dd881d/Screenshot_2019-11-21_at_17.32.21.png)  \n2. - F640441  \n3. After click on Authorize the Oauth client app receives authorization code as query string.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\nPlease read Impact section in the description. \n\nAlso please note while this is not necessarily a security leak for Gitlab, many different type of account hijacking is possible in other Oauth dependent web applications which are trusting Gitlab as an Oauth Provider. Eg: \n\n- The attacker registered with tim@apple.com on gitlab.com could hijack a user account which belongs to the real owner of tim@apple.com in a web application where social accounts are connected with (verified)email + password accounts.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_2019-11-21_at_17.32.48.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/62398bae-c7ad-4a32-b0c8-237ced120e87/Screenshot_2019-11-21_at_17.32.48.png)\n* [Screenshot_2019-11-21_at_17.32.21.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/d17326ae-66a5-48d4-a3c2-3ccc41dd881d/Screenshot_2019-11-21_at_17.32.21.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-22T09:19:38.932Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T12:46:08.879Z","closed_at":"2020-05-27T20:37:30.866Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Doing","HackerOne","backend","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","oauth","priority::1","rapid action email verification","security","severity::1","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-01-24","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37038","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/37038","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/37038/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/37038/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#37038","relative":"#37038","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#37038"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27424869,"iid":37032,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document using jenkinsfile-runner for Jenkins migration","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nMigrating to Jenkins can be complicated, as discussed at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22165#note_245126542 there is a Jenkinsfile runner (https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner) that we could call from normal GitLab CI, making first steps of migration very easy. @ctimberlake1 wrote a version of how this could work at https://lackastack.net/posts/gitlabci-jenkinsfile/ that could be adapted.\n\nAs part of our Jenkins Wrapper MVP(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208277) we are building a CLI tool (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208848) to automate as much of the process as possible for extracting a users Jenkins server configuration for running in GitLab Runners.  However, a significant portion of this process will involve manual steps.  \n\n### Proposal\n\nWe should document the usage of the tooling, along with updated content from https://lackastack.net/posts/gitlabci-jenkinsfile/, in the README for the tooling.

They can either select their personal namespace or apply the trial to a new group. In the future, we'd like to push more and more users to select a group trial as they have higher conversion rates. However, currently if a user inputs a group name that's already taken for example entering a value of \"group\" then it fails to create the trial due to the fact that the URL path is already taken. \n \n![Trial_Group_URL](/uploads/526f6cf6be9a08440ed3a3924ca6445e/Trial_Group_URL.png)\n \n\n## The process\n![groups](/uploads/58a22bccc9fdedaf1c27f6447d688aa8/groups.png)\n\n## Solution\n \nWe should utilize the same logic developed for the in-app group creation process to auto-append the the group URL path so it's a unique value (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/32458). I don't believe we need to show users that we're doing this during the trial creation process. When this issue is resolved if I signed up for a trial and attempted to apply the trial to a new group with the group name that's already taken for example \"group\" then on the backend we'd update the URL path to be group-(number).\n \nThis could be a factor in why we see a higher personal trial rate vs group trials. I'm marking this as a gitlab-org/growth/engineering~992791 due to the fact that this fix could increase group trials which we know have higher close rates

This is because they do not appear in the design, and rather the issue itself (behind the overlay).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Click on a design to open the overlay\n2. Trigger some kind of error (perhaps manually)\n3. Observe - there will be no flash present. Observing the DOM, however, the flash _is_ being triggered, but it's happening on the main page (in this case, on the issue page\n\n### Example Project\n\nGitLab 12.4+\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIf the user experiences an error when viewing a design, they get no feedback (via a flash)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIf the user experiences an error when viewing a design, they should get feedback (via a flash)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n**Scenario:** I have triggered an error manually, its message is `DesignManagement|TEST ERROR`.\n\nWhen viewing the design:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-11-21_at_9.44.04_am](/uploads/0b5bfb08704f2f309fd0124578cac6b0/Screen_Shot_2019-11-21_at_9.44.04_am.png)\n\nWhen closing the design:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-11-21_at_9.44.19_am](/uploads/f6e31bef885fd3260a47ba766260a664/Screen_Shot_2019-11-21_at_9.44.19_am.png)\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n`createFlash` currently uses the `.flash-container` to inject the flash element. One approach would be to define a container in this design overlay (e.g. `.dm-flash-container`), and add an optional argument to the `createFlash` function that takes a selector for injection. This way other similar overlays throughout GitLab could use the same method.\n\n### Designs from @jareko \n\n* The final [design is here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36925/designs/design-view-alert.png)\n* Link to specs [are here](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/jarek/gitlab-36925-design-view-alert/)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-21T00:21:00.125Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:59:26.429Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T05:16:59.349Z","closed_by":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","devops::plan","frontend","group::product planning","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"}],"author":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36925","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36925","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36925/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36925/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36925","relative":"#36925","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36925"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27287787,"iid":36896,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove Admin -\u003e Settings -\u003e Geo","description":"## Summary\nThis is a follow up effort for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19833\nInitial effort tracked in issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31938\n\nCurrently we are redirecting users from Admin -\u003e Settings -\u003e Geo **TO** Admin -\u003e Geo -\u003e Settings\n\nAs part of ~~12.7~~ 13.0 we will want to remove Admin -\u003e Settings -\u003e Geo leaving just the new location.

Also, if a user is unaware of the differences between the trial types and selects a personal trial when they're hoping for their team to trial the features only the admin will gain access during the trial reducing the likelihood that the account will upgrade. \n\n## Supporting data\nWe've found much higher upgrade rates for group trials than we do for personal trials, as displayed in (internal link)[this dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/547830/WIP:-Subscription-Portal-Dashboard). Part of this is likely due to the persona that is starting a personal trial over a group trial but we believe some if it is related to users not understanding a group trial, is required to ensure all users within an organization have access to the trial.\n \n## Expected outcome\nWe expect by requiring group creation for a trial, we will generate a net increase of 5 percentage points in the combined trial upgrade rate vs the control. We also believe we will see more total ARR generated in the experiment group vs the control.\n\n[This experiment is being tracked here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258629)\n \n## Experiment design \u0026 implementation\n50% of the trial flow will have the experience today where they can select to apply the trial to their personal username, existing group or create a new group. The experiment group will only see options to either apply the trial to an existing group or create a new group if they already have existing groups. If the user in the experiment group does not yet have a group they will be prompted to create one. \n \n| Control experience (default experience today) | Experiment group experience if they already have a group | Experiment group experience if do not yet have a group |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![trial_1](/uploads/ebcc4129c222352b70e39d3930bdf063/trial_1.png) | ![trial_2a](/uploads/07443c297a4c2594285425c48f1aaf29/trial_2a.png) | ![trial3](/uploads/a55b82921df650d95c1caa489292d4be/trial3.png) |\n| https://gitlab.com/-/trials/select | https://gitlab.com/-/trials/select | https://gitlab.com/-/trials/select |\n\n## ICE score\n\n| Impact | Confidence | Ease | Score |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| 8 |  8 |  7 | 8.333 |\n\n## Known assumptions\nWe believe that some personas are selecting personal trials knowing they will never upgrade but we currently have no way to quantify the number without running this experiment. \n \n## Results, learnings, next steps\nThis experiment has reached 96% significance with the experiment winning out over the control. A full review on the impact of this experiment on the trial conversion rate can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258629#note_496300674) (note this is an internal issue as it discusses actual conversion rates). \n\n---\n\n**Checklist**\n\n* [ ] Fill in the experiment summary and write more about the details of the experiment in the rest of the issue description. Some of these may be filled in through time (the \"Result, learnings, next steps\" section for example) but at least the experiment summary should be filled in right from the start.\n* [ ] Add the label of the Growth subgroup that will work on this experiment.\n* [ ] Mention the Product Manager and at least one Product Designer from the group that owns the part of the product that the experiment will affect.\n* [ ] Fill in the values in the [ICE score table](#ice-score) ping other team members for the values you aren’t confident about (i.e. engineering should almost always fill out the ease section). Add the gitlab-org/growth/product~12127129 label to indicate that the score is incomplete. \n* [ ] Replace the gitlab-org/growth/product~12127129 with an ICE low/medium/high score label once all

added.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-20T16:48:40.043Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T19:08:01.132Z","closed_at":"2020-10-12T17:29:03.540Z","closed_by":{"id":5755274,"username":"dreedy","name":"Dallas

discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34325.\n\nIn order to increase the chance of DDL to succeed, we want to implement optional behavior that allows us to control retries of a migration.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n```ruby\ndef up\n  drop_table :foo\nend\n```\n\nLet's assume `foo -\u003e bar` through a foreign key constraint. This would require an exclusive lock on `bar`, too, because of the FK. Let's also assume `bar` is a table with a lot of traffic.\n\n#### Today's behavior\n\nWorst case, the migration would fail after hitting statement timeout (15s). This is because it might not be able to acquire a lock on `bar` within this time frame.\n\nDuring this attempt, any further locks to `bar` cannot be granted (lock queue). This means, that any *reads* and writes to this table are going to be blocked for 15s currently. This would in turn stall all requests coming in that interact with `bar`.\n\n#### Proposed behavior\n\n```ruby\ndef up\n  with_lock_retries(timeout: 500.milliseconds) do\n    drop_table :foo\n  end\nend\n```\n\nHere, we set the `lock_timeout` to a low value (500ms) and attempt the migration step (`DROP TABLE foo`). If we don't manage to get the lock (ie. a lock timeout exception), we'll retry.\n\nThe retry can be implemented with\n* linear/exponential backoff\n* a timeout for the migration (10 minutes overall or similar)\n* Increasing `lock_timeout` to an upper threshold\n\nWe can start with indicating this new behavior as needed (like in the example above) or make the behavior a default for migrations anyways.\n\nThis way, we\n* have a guaranteed maximum time of blocking other reads/writes, substantially lower than statement timeout\n* increase the likelihood of successful migrations even facing high traffic time.\n\nWhat we don't get from this is the ability to decouple migrations from this from the success of a deploy. This may be a follow-up issue.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-20T15:11:36.311Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:50:04.712Z","closed_at":"2020-01-22T23:03:26.084Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"labels":["database","devops::data_stores","group::database","missed:12.7","priority::2","severity::2","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36859","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36859","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36859/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36859/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36859","relative":"#36859","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36859"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27261325,"iid":36853,"project_id":278964,"title":"Scope npm packages at the project level","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nNPM is not following the convention laid out by Maven in implementing project, group, and instance-level endpoints for uploading and downloading/installing packages.
