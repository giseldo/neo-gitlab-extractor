This means that if there are important compliance rules that must be enforced, every rule must be enforced. This means another team that simply wants to be notified and added as optional approvers of relevant merge requests must forgo using code owners or become a required approver.\n\nCurrently we handle the requiring of code owner approval through the protected branch POST (create) endpoint [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/projects/protected_refs_controller.rb#L17).\n\n## Proposal\n\nSpecify optional rules in the code owners file\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nUse declarative nomenclature before a rule to mark it as optional, for example `^`.\n\nFoe example in the following file, the `Database` section would not be enforced as it has been denoted as optional\n\n```\n[Documentation]\nee/docs    @gl-docs\ndocs       @gl-docs\n\n^[Database]\nREADME.md  @gl-database\nmodel/db   @gl-database\n```\n**For duplicated sections and rules, the most restrictive should always win.**\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ePrior proposal (for ref only): Allow users to select a code owners section as an approval rule for newly protected branches.\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n![image](/uploads/97d77e1f33c7bcc8db2e713963c529e6/image.png)\n\nCode owners dropdown\n![image](/uploads/9ccc4da732bb95fb888c33895f924ddf/image.png)\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\n- We can create a new protected branch with selected sections\n- When we create a new protected branch, we sync the approval rules\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n**Note** Make sure to use [`Gitlab::CodeOwners.sections`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48898) to fetch available sections\n\n## Feature flag\n\n`optional_code_owners_sections`\n\n### Release notes\n\n[Code owners sections](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html#code-owners-sections) allow each team to configure their own code owners entries independently. The section rules may be used for shared paths so that multiple teams can be added as reviewers. However, all code owner sections must be enforced or none. For example, if there are important compliance rules that must be enforced, every rule must be enforced. This means another team that simply wants to be added as optional approvers of relevant merge requests must forgo using code owners or become a required approver.\n\nGitLab 13.8 introduces the ability to designate optional sections in your code owners file. Simply prepend the section name with the caret `^` character and the section will be treated as optional. This means, related change through merge requests will not require approval from designated owners. With optional sections you may continue to designate responsible parties for various parts of the code while providing a more relaxed policy for parts of your project that may be updated often but don't require stringent reviews.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-30T13:14:35.214Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T11:58:49.849Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T07:51:20.343Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","UI text","backend","backend-weight::2","devops::create","direction","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::source code","release post item","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor Drozdov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1161495/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/igor.drozdov"},"user_notes_count":61,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232995","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232995","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232995/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232995/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232995","relative":"#232995","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232995"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5045,"epic":{"id":161029,"iid":5045,"title":"Support selecting code owners sections as required approval rule","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5045","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69232966,"iid":232992,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `reorder_designs`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:reorder_designs` feature flag ...\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::knowledge\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_knowledge`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @toupeira, @alexkalderimis \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n- ~frontend: Repositioning designs using drag \u0026 drop becomes available\n- ~backend: Designs returned from our GraphQL API are sorted by their `relative_position`\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAdd \"created_at\" field to job webhook, to improve consistency with the API response for jobs.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\nImproved data consistency across job API and job webhooks.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the \"created_at\" time field to the job webhook return - it already exists in the job API responses, so presumably just put it into the job webhook using same timestamp format and value.\n\n### Further details\n\nRight now, if we want to know 100% when a job was created based on a webhook we receive, we need to call the gitlab API to get this data, which essentially negates a lot of the benefits we get with webhooks. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo changes to security anticipated, just an update to webhook data.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\ncreated_at field exists in the webhook data for jobs, and matches the value that is returned from the job API for the specific jobs.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

complex regex","description":"**On gitlab.com**\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen sending a bulk tag deletion request to Container Registry API with a regular expression for filtering tags to keep that accepts several sub-regexes (`(?:x.*|v.+|latest|master|dev-.*|keep-.*)`), one of them (`v.+`) is not applied.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn a test project create several docker images with the following names:\n```\ndev-215\nkeep-special-image\nlatest\nmalandrin\nmalandro\nv\nv0.1.0\nv1\nv5\nx\nx1\nx1.1-alpha2\ny\n```\n\nMake an API call to bulk tag deletion method using the following parameters:\n```\ncurl --request DELETE \\\n  --data \"name_regex_delete=.*\" \\\n  --data \"name_regex_keep=(?:x.*|v.+|latest|master|dev-.*|keep-.*)\" \\\n  --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN:\u003cTOKEN\u003e\" \\\n  ${GITLAB_API_URL}/projects/\u003cPROJECT_PROJECT_ID\u003e/registry/repositories/\u003cPROJECT_REPOSITORY_ID\u003e/tags\n```\nThis will return a `202` code.\n\nAfter a while, this is the list of existing tags:\n```\ndev-215\nkeep-special-image\nlatest\nx\nx1\nx1.1-alpha2\n```\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe tags starting with 'v' have also been deleted despite the regex containing `v.+`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUnless I'm missing something, the tags starting with 'v' shouldn't have been deleted.\n\nThe `v.+` is even one of the examples in the documentation of the cleanup policy for tags: `(?:v.+|master|release)` ([here](https://gitlab.com/help/user/packages/container_registry/index?rel=noopener+noreferrer\u0026target=_blank#regex-pattern-examples)).\n\nIndeed, if we replace `v.+` with `v.*` in the previous call, everything works as expected.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T16:17:32.250Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T03:06:11.386Z","closed_at":"2022-01-31T03:06:11.367Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖

[SafeParamsHelper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/682a3c0134f2cfec9e5743aa97fbaf2a7d89e65f/app/helpers/safe_params_helper.rb#L8) to filter out some keys before passing them to `url_for`:

that there are a [lot more dangerous keys](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/12f3f11f61eccc5d9423b288a08cb1fc7e60999b/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/route_set.rb#L781):\n\n```ruby

:original_script_name, :relative_url_root]  \n```\n\nThis means that anywhere `safe_params` is used, the domain could be changed using the `domain` query. Most of the `build_canonical_path` methods call `url_for(safe_params)` which then gets used by [RoutableActions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/682a3c0134f2cfec9e5743aa97fbaf2a7d89e65f/app/controllers/concerns/routable_actions.rb#L54):\n\n```ruby  \ndef ensure_canonical_path(routable, requested_full_path)  \n    return unless request.get?\n\n    canonical_path = routable.full_path  \n    if canonical_path != requested_full_path  \n      if !request.xhr? \u0026\u0026 request.format.html? \u0026\u0026 canonical_path.casecmp(requested_full_path) != 0  \n        flash[:notice] = \"#{routable.class.to_s.titleize} '#{requested_full_path}' was moved to '#{canonical_path}'. Please update any links and bookmarks that may still have the old path.\"  \n      end\n\n      redirect_to build_canonical_path(routable)  \n    end  \n  end  \n```\n\nThis creates an open redirect in all of the `RoutableActions` routes by making `canonical_path != requested_full_path` (eg using a capital letter) and adding the `domain` param:\n\n1. Visit https://gitlab.com/vakzz-h1/Redirect1?domain=aw.rs  \n1. You will be redirected to https://aw.rs/\n\nThe other key that can be abused is `script_name`, as this is appended to the start of the url and can be used to fake a protocol such as javascript:\n\n1. Visit https://gitlab.com/vakzz-h1/redirect1/-/issues?script_name=javascript:alert(1)//  \n1. Look at the RSS Feed link\n\n  ```html  \n  \u003ca class=\"btn btn-svg has-tooltip\" data-container=\"body\" title=\"\"  href=\"javascript:alert(1)//vakzz-h1/redirect1/-/issues.atom?feed_token=XXXX\u0026amp;state=opened\" data-original-title=\"Subscribe to RSS feed\"\u003e  \n    \u003csvg class=\"s16 qa-rss-icon\" data-testid=\"rss-icon\"\u003e  \n      \u003cuse xlink:href=\"https://gitlab.com/assets/icons-37f758fe6359f04ae912169432d8ddd9dd45a1316d8fa634996c10bd033e9726.svg#rss\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e  \n    \u003c/svg\u003e  \n  \u003c/a\u003e  \n ```  \n1. On gitlab.com this is blocked by the CSP\n\nThere are a bunch of other places that use `safe_params` that could be exploited such as the [_viewer.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/682a3c0134f2cfec9e5743aa97fbaf2a7d89e65fapp/views/projects/blob/_viewer.html.haml#L7)\n\n  ```haml  \n  - viewer_url = local_assigns.fetch(:viewer_url) { url_for(safe_params.merge(viewer: viewer.type, format: :json)) } if load_async  \n  .blob-viewer{ data: { type: viewer.type, rich_type: rich_type, url: viewer_url, path: viewer.blob.path }, class: ('hidden' if hidden) }  \n  ```\n\nThis allows an attacker to specify the `viewer_url` for the blob url. Since the json returned by the url has an `html` attributes it allows arbitrary html to be inserted. The below uses https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1999965 as the viewer url and 1 click csp bypass (same as https://hackerone.com/reports/662287#activity-6026826) with https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1999974/raw for the js payload:\n\n1.

Clicking anywhere will trigger an alert\n\nI've only skimmed the other locations that use `safe_params` but it looks like there are a few more that load data via javascript or could be turned into open redirects. I also haven't looked into the impact of the open redirects to see if they could be escalated to leak sensitive information, I'll update the report if I find anything else.\n\nI've put all of these in a single report as the mitigation is the same for all of them, but if you would like me to split them into separate reports I can do that as well. I've also set the severity to high due to the number of places that this is used and relative ease of trigger it, but the individual issues are probably less so might need to be adjusted. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`SafeParamsHelper.safe_params` only filters out the keys `:host, :port, :protocol` but there are other dangerous ones\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \n`SafeParamsHelper.safe_params` should filter out all of the reserved options:\n\n```ruby  \nRESERVED_OPTIONS = [:host, :protocol, :port, :subdomain, :domain, :tld_length,  \n                          :trailing_slash, :anchor, :params, :only_path, :script_name,  \n                          :original_script_name, :relative_url_root]  \n```\n\n\n### Output of checks  \nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\n* open redirect on quire a few routes  \n* reflected xss using the `javascript` protocol  \n* reflected xss with csp bypass using the blob viewer","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T15:43:17.947Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T13:46:02.711Z","closed_at":"2020-10-02T10:10:34.295Z","closed_by":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"labels":["HackerOne","devops::manage","group::optimize","priority::2","section::dev","security","security-backlog::valid","severity::2","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-09-27","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232829","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232829","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232829/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232829/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232829","relative":"#232829","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232829"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69179464,"iid":232826,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove Constants Duplication in Conan Package API classes","description":"## Summary\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/regex.rb#L6-7\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/packages/conan/file_metadatum.rb#L21-22\n\nme: why? :thinking: Can't we use only one?

Specifically, we want to track when a commit is performed:\n- Through the web IDE\n- Through the Single File Editor\n- Through the Snippets editor\n\nTherefore, we cannot fully rely on the `Gitlab::UsageDataCounters::TrackUniqueActions` service class because we need a custom set of actions and a payload that is different from the existing behavior.\n\nThat's why I'd proposed to create a service class named like `Gitlab::UsageDataCounters::TrackUniqueVirtualActions` that would extend the `Gitlab::UsageDataCounters::TrackUniqueActions` module.\n\nThis new service could be something like:\n\n```ruby\nmodule Gitlab\n  module UsageDataCounters\n    module TrackUniqueVirtualActions\n      VIRTUAL_ACTIONS = %i[edit_by_web_ide edit_by_sfe edit_by_snippet_editor]\n\n      class \u003c\u003c self\n        def track_action(event_action:, author_id:, time: Time.zone.now)\n          return unless Gitlab::CurrentSettings.usage_ping_enabled\n          return unless Feature.enabled?(FEATURE_FLAG)          \n          return unless valid_action?(event_action)\n          \n          target_key = key(event_action, time)\n\n          Gitlab::Redis::HLL.add(key: target_key, value: author_id, expiry: KEY_EXPIRY_LENGTH)\n        end\n\n        def count_unique_events(event_action:, date_from:, date_to:)\n          keys = (date_from.to_date..date_to.to_date).map { |date| key(event_action, date) }\n\n          Gitlab::Redis::HLL.count(keys: keys)\n        end\n\n        private                      \n\n        def valid_action?(action)\n          VIRTUAL_ACTIONS.key?(action)\n        end\n\n        def key(event_action, date)\n          year_day = date.strftime('%G-%j')\n          \"#{year_day}-{#{event_action}}\"\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis is a quick approach to what would we need to achieve. We would need to think more about the action names and whether it's the best way for reusing it with other events.\n\nBasically, this way we can store unique events related to virtual actions, we just need to figure out the programming nuances.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T14:53:28.741Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T07:06:43.765Z","closed_at":"2020-08-28T07:48:10.155Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Metrics","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","group::editor","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232824","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232824","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232824/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232824/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232824","relative":"#232824","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232824"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4014,"epic":{"id":84975,"iid":4014,"title":"Create:Editor Instrumentation","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4014","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69176154,"iid":232820,"project_id":278964,"title":"Warning on merge request diff when files collapsed","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCollapsing large files on a merge request diff is done to enhance the performance and responsiveness of the diff section in a merge request. However, the fact that some files are collapsed may be missed when scrolling through the list of files, causing some files to go unreviewed.\n\nWe have introduced a visible warning atop the merge request diff page, clearly informing the user when a file in the section is collapsed. This will ensure all related changes in the merge request are reviewed.\n\n### Further details\n\nUsers have rightfully complained about how the current situation where we collapse some files for performance reasons might lead to **missing important changes** during code review.\n\nThis can lead to bugs, outages and other major problems in production for our users and customers.\n\nAlso, when reviewing code the reviewer might run a native browser \"Find in page\" to see the occurrences  of said variable/term. If they're not aware some areas are collapsed, they might be lead to believe it doesn't occur in the rest of the changes. But it might.\n\nMake it clearly visible when at least ONE diff file is collapsed. In the warning add a button to \"expand all\".\n\n**Note**: we might want to add a slight note in a popover/tooltip that expanding all at once might cause some performance problems.\n\n### User experience goal\n\nMake users easily and clearly aware when the content shown is only a partial view of the whole set of changes\n\n### Proposal\n\nIt would be beneficial to set a priority order for the alerts shown above the diff. Today, we have two alerts: when there are too many files to show and when there are merge conflicts ([mockup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/81d8a9e1593365eda696c11c546d14d9/image.png)). With this issue, we will have a third case: when some files are collapsed by default. To avoid the situation where we show 2 or 3 of those alerts at the same time, we could set a priority to show only one at a time, like so:\n\n1. Merge conflicts\n1. Too many files to show\n1. Some files are collapsed by default\n\nAs for the alert to be introduced in this issue, **some files are collapsed by default**:\n\n![mock](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/cc9688cf6a40f1309341723e7e4f0cf1/image.png)\n\nHowever, as it's rightly noted in the description, it should still be visible if users follow a link to a discussion/file (i.e., make it somehow sticky). Today, those two alerts shown above the diffs are not sticky, so we should change that too.\n\n### Further details\n\n* Shouldn't apply in File-by-file mode\n* It should still be visible if users follow a link to a discussion/file. ie, make it somehow sticky.\n\n### Stretch goals\n\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243572: Adapt the existing “Too many files to show” big, orange alert so it conforms with our Pajamas guidelines on alerts and is consistent with the other alerts shown above the diff. Also make the UI copy a bit easier to understand.\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243573: Move the `Show latest version` and `Expand all` buttons to the left, after the comparison dropdowns, so they are more visible.\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243574: Change the button label to “Expand all {+files+}” so that the action is crystal clear.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\nAdd a section to diffs mentioning an increased awareness if any content has been \"hidden\" for performance reasons.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

This will ensure all related changes in the merge request are reviewed.\n\n![collapsed_diff](/uploads/758f22fff9773330c116b27782068653/collapsed_diff.png)\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviewing_and_managing_merge_requests.html#merge-request-diff-file-navigation","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T14:18:49.411Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T21:58:53.151Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T12:01:10.513Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","UX","design-weight::2","devops::create","feature::addition","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","release post item","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232820","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232820","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232820/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232820/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232820","relative":"#232820","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232820"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3607,"epic":{"id":68969,"iid":3607,"title":"Merge requests UX improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3607","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69175366,"iid":232818,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support HTTPS proxy settings of RetireJS","description":"NOTE if you are a user who also would like to see this feature, please UPVOTE 👍 it and comment to help it get prioritized (So it’s raised as part of our [sensing mechanisms]( https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-management/process/#sensing-mechanism).

If `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, it will be passed to the `retire` command line as a CLI option. Thank you!\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a software developer I want to run retirejs behind a corporate proxy so I do not have to create and maintain the `RETIREJS_JS_ADVISORY_DB` and `RETIREJS_NODE_ADVISORY_DB` manually.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager).

If `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, it should be pass to the `retire` command line as a CLI option.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe retire.js analyzer should check for the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable being set. If set it should set the `--proxy` option of the `retire` command accordingly.\n\n~~Alternatively you can give a Retire.JS command line ENV variable which can be configured for the dependency scanner. This will allow setting additional options.~~\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] add support for `HTTPS_PROXY` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/merge_requests/93\n- [x] add specific test to the CI config (downstream pipeline using a supported Secure test project)\n- [ ] ~~update [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning)~~ This is a generic variable that we do not document explicitely. We might have a generic statement added for these variables: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76410\n\n### Further details\n\nIf you check out the README for the retire.js command line you will notice it has an entry for Proxy URL:\n\n```\n  --proxy \u003curl\u003e            Proxy url (http://some.sever:8080)\n```\n\nFurther if you check the code\nhttps://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/1aba081b5d5363add13710edeb470d5eb4f3c914/node/lib/repo.js\n\n```javascript\nif (options.proxy) {\nreqOptions.agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options.proxy);\n}\n```\n\nYou can see that it does not use the `HTTPS_PROXY` env variables. It relies on the the command line option being set to use the proxy. Therefore retire.js does not support a proxy from the ENV variables and there is no way to configure the options to retire.js from the Dependency Scanner.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\n~~To be documented in [Configuring specific analyzers used by dependency scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-specific-analyzers-used-by-dependency-scanning)~~ See implementation plan.\n\nWe might also add a doc section about setting up HTTPS proxies. This section would list the Dependency Scanning analyzers supporting proxy settings.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nTo be tested using one of the supported Secure test projects:\n1. create a new branch in [tests/js-npm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm) or [tests/js-yarn](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-yarn) where a proxy is set up; see [offline-FREEZE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/js-npm/-/blob/offline-FREEZE/.gitlab-ci.yml#L34) branch of `tests/js-npm`\n1. update the CI configuration of the [retire.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js) analyzer, and add a QA job that uses this branch and where `HTTPS_PROXY` is set in the `variables` of the job definition; see [`js-npm-offline-qa`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/blob/v2.11.1/.gitlab-ci.yml#L23)\n\nThe test should set up a proxy to access [jsrepository.json](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/master/repository/jsrepository.json), [npmrepository.json](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/master/repository/npmrepository.json), and to npmjs.com. Direct access to these must be blocked. All this can be done in the `before_script` of the scanning job, similar to what is done for the `offline-FREEZE` branch.

ZAP rule execution time in scan summary","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDifferent DAST scan rules take varying amount of time to complete depending on the target web application. If scan rule execution time is provided in the scan summary it will help to identify the long running scan rules. Users can then take action on long running scan rules like disable them if it's not important/relevant or tweak the scans parameters to make the rule complete fasters. This will ultimately help users to configure faster and effective DAST scans.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUser should be able to see execution time of each scan rule in the scan summary e.g\n\n```\nPASS: Cross Site Scripting (Persistent) - Prime [40016]: Took 10 minutes\nPASS: Remote Code Execution - Shell Shock [10048]: Took 150 minutes\nPASS: Cross Site Scripting (Persistent) - Spider [40017]: Took 20 minutes\nPASS: Script Active Scan Rules [50000]: Took 7 minutes\nPASS: Source Code Disclosure - Git  [41]: Took 2 minutes\nPASS: Source Code Disclosure - File Inclusion [43]: Took 30 minutes\n```\nNow user can identify `Remote Code Execution - Shell Shock [10048]` takes 150 mins and is the major reason the scan takes longer time to complete. User can now make a call if this rule is applicable to the target application or is it worth running this rule for 150 minutes and disable or keep it running.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCurrently zap.out logs does generate logs per scan rule with the time taken for execution. Time from these logs can be collected and added up per scan rule to display it along with the scan summary. \n\n\u003e [zap.out] 3937350 [Thread-8] INFO org.parosproxy.paros.core.scanner.HostProcess  - completed host/plugin https://scan-target.com | TestExternalRedirect in 2813.043s with 33151 message(s) sent and 0 alert(2020-07-28 05:08:43,565 Starting new HTTP connection (1): localhost:46374\n\n#### Implementation Plan\n\n`ScanSummaryService` already possesses a list of each alert with its history record. We can use sum of the `timeelapsedmillis` field from the history records for all alerts found by a given rule to get the total time the rule took to execute.\n\n1. Add `timeelapsedmillis` to the fields fetched by `HttpMessagesQuery` and the properties of `HttpMessage`\n1. In `ScanSummaryService`, sum up the time elapsed values for every alert related to a plugin, and add that number to the rule summary printed. Ex: `PASS: Source Code Disclosure - File Inclusion [43]: Took 30 minutes`\n1. Print the result as seconds if \u003c 60 seconds, or minutes otherwise","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T10:52:02.976Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T11:42:18.950Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T22:40:36.112Z","closed_by":{"id":4985194,"username":"derekferguson","name":"Derek Ferguson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4985194/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/derekferguson"},"labels":["Category:DAST","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","dast::zap","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::scheduling"],"milestone":{"id":427855,"iid":11,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 4-7 releases","description":"Bigger issues we plan to ship in the next 4-7 releases, but don't have a designated release yet. \r\n\r\nDO NOT add small changes, bugs, regressions to this milestone.","state":"active","created_at":"2017-12-11T16:26:55.828Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T11:09:43.594Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/11"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5791466,"username":"ngeorge1","name":"Nikhil George","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5791466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ngeorge1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232801","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232801","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232801/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232801/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232801","relative":"#232801","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232801"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3062,"epic":{"id":40529,"iid":3062,"title":"DAST: error handling and messaging","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3062","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69165948,"iid":232794,"project_id":278964,"title":"Include the installation instructions for Composer dependencies in the Package Registry UI","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T07:24:50.649Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T16:41:25.760Z","closed_at":"2020-09-02T16:11:39.984Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","Category:Web IDE","DEPRECATE_pipeline authoring","Deliverable","UX","devops::verify","direction","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":4155490,"username":"marcel.amirault","name":"Marcel Amirault","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155490/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marcel.amirault"},{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},{"id":6115425,"username":"v_mishra","name":"Veethika M","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f09a3a0badac17a57e28b4e18a45c1c0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/v_mishra"}],"author":{"id":2243533,"username":"jyavorska","name":"Jason Yavorska","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2243533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jyavorska"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4155490,"username":"marcel.amirault","name":"Marcel Amirault","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155490/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marcel.amirault"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232779","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232779","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232779/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232779/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232779","relative":"#232779","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232779"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4067,"epic":{"id":87562,"iid":4067,"title":"Make Editor Lite more aware of .gitlab-ci.yml MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4067","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69151211,"iid":232761,"project_id":278964,"title":"Realtime feedback for editing .gitlab-ci.yml doesn’t work in Google Chrome/Chromium","description":"### Summary\n\nRealtime feedback for editing `.gitlab-ci.yml` doesn’t work on a project in GitLab.com in Google Chrome/Chromium.\n\n**EDIT: Google Chrome is required to reproduce this** (`@tnir`)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/states/mr_widget_secondary_geo_node.vue#L13\n\nWe'd access the data we need as `mr.licenseScanning.project_licenses_path`\n\n#### The ajax request:\n\nIn the `MrWidetPolicyViolation` component we'd initialize a store similar to how we do for \n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/license_compliance/mr_widget_license_report.vue#L14\n\nThe `MrWidgetLicenseReport` is a working example of how we do an AJAX request within a single vue component on the MR page. It is done for the License scan MR widget.\n\nThe `MrWidgetLicenses` component is aliased and rendered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/mr_widget_options.vue#L342\n\nWe do the same for `MrWidetPolicyViolation` in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/states/mr_widget_policy_violation.vue\n\n#### Leverage the existing LICENSE_LIST vuex module to handle store, actions, getters, and mutations.\n\nWe can use the `LICENSE_LIST` vuex module defined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/license_compliance/store/modules/list/index.js\n\nThis is instead of the `LICENSE_MANAGEMENT` vuex module that is used in `MrWidgetLicenseReport`.\n\nThe difference is this.\n\n`LICENSE_MANAGEMENT` - covers anything to do with defining license policies\n\n`LICENSE_LIST` - covers anything to do with detected licenses in the project.\n\n\n## In Summary for Option 2:\n\nActual work involves,\n\nAdding resource path to json path, defining prop in `mr-widget-policy-violation-component`, making use of the actions and getters in the `LICENSE_LIST` vuex module, rendering singular/plural version of text.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-28T19:28:10.002Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:45:16.513Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T22:25:05.495Z","closed_by":{"id":5412787,"username":"nmccorrison","name":"Neil McCorrison","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5412787/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmccorrison"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","UX","approvals","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","security reports","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"}],"author":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232721","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232721","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232721/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232721/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232721","relative":"#232721","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232721"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69137686,"iid":232711,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Secret Detection Scanner, Gitleaks, to v5.0.1","description":"### Problem to solve\nGitleaks v5.0.1 has been released which includes two useful features that will help the secrets analyzer mature: \n\n1.

If we didn't have good monitoring on this we might have missed that and some indexing would have been missed.\n\n## Details\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/2408#note_386531952 I unpaused the indexing and I noticed that it didn't fully finish the unpausing. I couldn't tell why since I only see a [start log for `ElasticIndexingControlWorker`](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/kibana#/discover?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:'2020-07-27T21:09:58.044Z',to:'2020-07-28T06:09:55.728Z'))\u0026_a=(columns:!(_source),filters:!(('$state':(store:appState),meta:(alias:!n,disabled:!f,index:AWNABDRwNDuQHTm2tH6l,key:json.class.keyword,negate:!f,params:(query:ElasticIndexingControlWorker),type:phrase),query:(match_phrase:(json.class.keyword:ElasticIndexingControlWorker)))),index:AWNABDRwNDuQHTm2tH6l,interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:ElasticIndexingControlWorker),sort:!())) . \n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-07-28_at_4.04.46_pm](/uploads/7f9d4055e0900067fd9d1d008d976549/Screen_Shot_2020-07-28_at_4.04.46_pm.png)\n\nPerhaps this processed was somehow killed in the middle of resuming all the jobs.

In the section headers there should be a badge counter of how many items are in each section. The search functionality should return results that narrow each section down.\n\nThis issue does not cover the scope of populating the dropdown with group milestones on the release edit page. That will be covered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232577 \n\n### Intended users\n\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nThe developer should be able to pass in props to make it so that this component renders multiple sections, each with a counter of how many items are in each section.\n\nThe user should be able to use this UI in order to select items from multiple sections. For example, project milestones and group milestones. They should be able to see how many items are in each section, and should be able to enter a single search term that returns results in each section.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n\nUpdate the current `milestone dropdown combobox` component to be able to have separated sections and badge counters like the proposed design. The search functionality should return results in each section. Change the name of that component from [project_milestone_combobox.vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/milestones/project_milestone_combobox.vue) to milestone_combobox.vue\n\n| Current | Proposed |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/e268d4a535657366f93daac28b590586/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/7d68103f9e101cdb70f9f8d30e6f453f/image.png) |\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis benefits the completion of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121476 by enabling the design proposal for the Release edit page.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-27T20:21:57.215Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:45:28.893Z","closed_at":"2020-10-23T12:52:35.886Z","closed_by":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Category:Subgroups","UX","cicd::active","component:dropdown","devops::release","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","missed:13.5","section::ops","subgroups","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233755,"iid":53,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:22.328Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:04.376Z","due_date":"2020-11-17","start_date":"2020-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/53"},"assignees":[{"id":4446737,"username":"jakeburden","name":"Jake Burden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4446737/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jakeburden"}],"author":{"id":4446737,"username":"jakeburden","name":"Jake Burden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4446737/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jakeburden"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4446737,"username":"jakeburden","name":"Jake Burden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4446737/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jakeburden"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232569","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":1},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232569","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232569/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232569/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232569","relative":"#232569","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232569"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4362,"epic":{"id":107312,"iid":4362,"title":"Releases \u003c\u003e Group Milestones","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4362","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69038053,"iid":232537,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve the project deletion UI text to be more clear and conventional","description":"### Background\n\n~\"group::compliance\" updated the project deletion experience to make it scarier in #220243 in %13.3. \n\nWhile evaluating this change https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/907#note_384755052, a number of ideas were consider to improve to the project deletion experience (delayed or immediate).\n\n### Proposal\n\nModify the project deletion interfaces to use the following text.

An array of licenses is not enough information to determine if this licenses in the array represent an AND or OR relation.\n\nE.g.\n\nThe following tells us that the software dependency is licensed under BSD-2-Clause, MIT but it does not tell us if it is licensed under BSD-2-Clause and MIT or if it is licensed under BSD-2-Clause or MIT.\n\n```json\n\"licenses\": [\n  \"BSD-2-Clause\",\n  \"MIT\"\n]\n```\n\nA new major version of the report schema may need to be introduced to handle these types of scenarios.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nTBD\n\n### Documentation\n\nTBD\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThe test fixtures will need to be updated. \n\nE.g.

Today, we show it, and on top of that there are some advanced metrics or controls on the **current** deployment. For example:\n\n* Is there any critical alerts caused by the current deployment? =\u003e [We show alerts in footer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#view-the-latest-alerts-for-environments).\n* Can I monitor how the current deployment is performing on the environment? =\u003e Click [\"Monitoring\" button](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#monitoring-environments)\n* Can I see the website of the current deployment? =\u003e Click [\"Open live environment\" button](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#using-the-environment-url).\n* Can I stop the environment? =\u003e Click \"Stop environment\" button. Important note: this [automatically triggers a corresponding stop job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#stopping-an-environment) in the **same pipeline** with the current deployment job. Given current and upcoming deployments run in different pipelines, this makes a similar confusion @nfriend pointed above.\n* Can I re-deploy the current deployment? =\u003e Click \"Re-deploy to environment\" button.\n* and more\n\nSo almost all of the features on this environment index page were designed for the **current** deployment, which is what actually exists on the environment. We should keep the current UX, otherwise we need to revisit the concepts of the above features for running deployment, just like [a proposal to hide button suggested by @nfriend](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232494#note_458401988). We need to do similar follow-up for the rest of the features as well, which probably we cannot afford.\n\nThe main purpose of this issue is showing a complementary information about \"what's the next deployment?\". The next deployment job could be [a manual job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/incremental_rollouts.html#manual-rollouts) that is waiting for operators executing the job, or it could be [a scheduled job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/incremental_rollouts.html#timed-rollouts) that will be automatically executed after a specific period, or it could be a normal job that will be executed after an upstream stage jobs have finished, or it could be being deployed (i.e. running) by one of the above paths. I'm referring these type of deployment jobs as \"upcoming deployments\", but please let me know if there is a better terminology.\n\nNow, this issue should be fairly easy to be accomplished if we simply add a new column, because it doesn't affect the current behavior thus require no follow-ups. For the MVC sake, this issue targets only running status as a upcoming deployment, however, I believe this feature should be extended as above.\n\n#### Payload change\n\nWe'll change the `environments.json` payload to have `last_deployment` and `upcoming_deployment` per environment. The `upcoming_deployment` payload is formatted in the same schema with `last_deployment`.\n\nThis `upcoming_deployment` is selected by the following criteria:\n\n* Deployments with `running` status.\n* Newer `deployment` object than the latest/current deployment.\n* When there are multiple candidates, the latest one is returned i.e. the largest `deployments.id`.\n* If there is no relevant record, it returns `nil` or the key doesn't exist in the hash.\n\nA few notes:\n\n- It only contains necessary data to present the UI and excludes some unnecessary metadata such as `manual_actions`, `scheduled_actions` to save up some payload size.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThe user currently has no way of knowing that a deployment is in progress when viewing the environment page.\nThis is super useful with the connectivity of [showing alerts in the environment page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214634) as this will give the user an indication of what action they can take during an alert.\nStop a rollout that is in progress or rollback for a deployment that has completed \n\n#### More detailed Upcoming deployments (Next iteration)\n\nAn upcoming deployment should be selected by the following order:\n\n1. If there is a running deployment job, the deployment job is selected.\n1. If there is a scheduled deployment job (i.e. [`when: delayed`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#when)), the deployment job is selected.\n1. If there is a manual deployment job (i.e. [`when: manual`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#when)), the deployment job is selected.\n1. If there are no relevant deployment jobs, it shows empty.\n\n### Breakdown\n\n- ~frontend to display the badges (this will already show the statuses that are currently provided by the BE) behind a ~\"feature flag\" (type `development`)\n- ~backend to provide the additional statuses\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate?

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

sum of issue weights in Epic","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen looking at the list of Epics and Issues in an Epic ([example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3403)), there's a helpful indication of how many issues and epics are in the epic being displayed.\n\nIt would be even better if these indicators included the recursive total weight for all contained issues and epics.\n\n![image](/uploads/960ab7442471992bf4c10c53c0f97d97/image.png)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe user is able to determine the amount of work contained in an Epic.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the sum of weights to the indicators at the top of Epics and Issues. E.g.\n\n![image](/uploads/94feb5fe1c7b10953b0382c4dc82091a/image.png)\n\n### Further details\n\nA \"flat\" epic (with only issues as children) is easy.\n\n![image](/uploads/3d25a277e7bf3573802cfe19f48f697b/image.png)\n\nAnd epic containing one of more epics, would need to find the combined weight of all \"flat\" epics, add this to the weight sum for any top-level issues and display that instead.\n\n![image](/uploads/154b6bed79eada850738ac405e917819/image.png)\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThe sum relies on issues that the current user (logged in or not) is able to see. We need to decide whether we want to show a potentially incorrect number or show nothing at all if any of the weights are missing.\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-27T05:47:47.511Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:52:37.020Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T06:01:15.426Z","closed_by":{"id":3236898,"username":"rajatgitlab","name":"Rajat Jain","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3236898/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rajatgitlab"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Next Up","customer","devops::plan","epic tree","epics","frontend","group::product planning","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":3236898,"username":"rajatgitlab","name":"Rajat Jain","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3236898/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rajatgitlab"},{"id":3617348,"username":"uhlexsis","name":"Alexis Ginsberg","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3617348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/uhlexsis"}],"author":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3236898,"username":"rajatgitlab","name":"Rajat Jain","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3236898/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rajatgitlab"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232458","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232458","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232458/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/232458/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#232458","relative":"#232458","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#232458"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":76,"epic":{"id":141,"iid":76,"title":"Progress information in epics","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/76","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68995193,"iid":232386,"project_id":278964,"title":"Direct asset URL for releases is returning 404 Not Found","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nFound while testing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/37557.\n\nWhen you create a release with external assets link (for example https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/11775053/releases/assets-links-1), `direct_asset_url` returned is the following:\n```\n$ curl https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/11775053/releases/assets-links-1 | jq | grep direct_asset_url\n        \"direct_asset_url\": \"https://gitlab.com/krasio/public-test-yard/-/releases/assets-links-1/binaries/1\",\n```\nWhen you try to access this URL it returns `404 Found` instead of redirecting to the external URL.\n\nThe reason is that we generate this URL using format like `/releases/:tag/:filepath`, while the route defined for asset links downloads is `/releases/:tag/downloads/*filepath`:\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9cda1414a433c841980d2aa8625c89fd15c9fef6/lib/api/entities/releases/link.rb#L20\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9cda1414a433c841980d2aa8625c89fd15c9fef6/config/routes/project.rb#L196\n\nEven if you manually change the URL from `/releases/assets-links-1/binaries/1` to `/releases/assets-links-1/downloads/binaries/1` it's still not working. The reason is that because the way the route is defined (`'downloads/*filepath'`) the leading slash is not included in `params[:filepath]` but in the controller we do `release.links.find_by_filepath!(sanitized_filepath)` so it fails to find the link.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n* Create a release that has an external asset link (using the API)\n* Try to access the external asset\n\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/krasio/public-test-yard/-/releases\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe direct asset URL returns `404 Not Found`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe direct asset URL should redirect to the external asset, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9cda1414a433c841980d2aa8625c89fd15c9fef6/spec/controllers/projects/releases_controller_spec.rb#L212-250 (btw this spec is passing because it is controller spec and is bypassing the routing, so the `filepath` is provided as expected).\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1. We can update the way we generate `direct_assets_url` to match the route\n1.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n#### Extra information from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217691\n\n\u003e The following discussion from !29516 should be addressed:\n\u003e \n\u003e - [ ] @pedroms started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29516#note_338422750):  (+1 comment)\n\u003e \n\u003e     \u003e @jboyson 🤔 **Question**: One thing I didn't test: how are suggestions being handled?

deploy keys does not inform the user if in use","description":"\n### Release Notes\n\nIn this release, we have added an additional safety measure to warn users that a deploy key is in use before deleting the key. This will help prevent accidentally breaking workflows of that project.  \n\n\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nFollow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30769#note_384759901\n\nWhenever a deploy key is about to be deleted, if that deploy key is currently assigned to a protected branch: deleting this key may disable users to do their CI/CD operations which involved accessing their protected branch.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n--\u003e\n\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e \n\nUsers should be notified of the fact that they might be invalidating CI configurations when deleting a deploy key.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWhen deleting a deploy key we should update the modal that is summoned up with a new [GlModal](https://design.gitlab.com/components/modals) and give it the following copy:\n\n- Title: Do you want to delete this deploy key?\n- Body: `Are you sure you want to delete this deploy key? If anything is still using this key, it will stop working.`\n- Actions: \n   - Tertiary button with label `Cancel` \n   - Primary `danger` button with label `Delete deploy key`\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-24T10:48:45.461Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T10:59:16.319Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T13:57:54.205Z","closed_by":{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","SUS::FY22 Q1 - Done","UI text","UX","UX FY21-Q4","UX debt","devops::release","feature::enhancement","group::release","release post item::in review","section::ops","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"}],"author":{"id":489558,"username":"dimitrieh","name":"Dimitrie Hoekstra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/489558/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dimitrieh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":262533,"username":"afontaine","name":"Andrew Fontaine","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/262533/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/afontaine"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231474","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231474","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231474/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231474/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#231474","relative":"#231474","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#231474"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":68939532,"iid":231459,"project_id":278964,"title":"Test zip object storage on docs.gitlab.com and percentage rollout","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nIn evaluation of the new object storage architecture we want to be able to confirm performance of serving Pages files.

In this case, it may be required to restart pages daemon as well after disabling feature flag.\n* Users complain about range-requests not working\n\n    This is expected because new architecture does not support them yet. It may be required to rollback the feature.\n\n\n### Proposal \n\n- [x] Test [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238986) on a personal project with and without custom domain to make sure paths are handled properly. (tested on https://vshushlin.gitlab.io/pages-zip2/) \n- [x] Notify people in slack that we're enabling this feature for docs.gitlab.com\n- [x] Enable [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238986) for docs.gitlab.com during a less busy time for a few hours a few days in the row\n- [x] Cross-link chatops message to #docs channel in slack(see https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C16HYA2P5/p1601299492027300?thread_ts=1601298644.026500\u0026cid=C16HYA2P5)\n- [x] Visualize timings for docs.gitlab.com in https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/kibana and see difference\n- [x] Enable it for longer time if now problems discovered\n- [x] Record any discovered problems\n- [x] If test is successful, leave feature flag enabled.\n- [x] Get in touch with @davis_townsend to that validate costs for the zip architecture are acceptable\n\n### Testing schedule\n\nPlease note the following during tests:\n\n- Resources loading times, especially anything you would consider slow\n- Files load correctly e.g. js, css\n- Report any issues to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231459\n- Keep an eye on any metrics/dashboards like Google analytics (if any).

E.g. If we cache 3 zip archives with 100 files each, this metric should be 300. After 5% rollout this metric grow on one of the servers, but memory usage doesn't. Most likey we don't decrease this metric properly.\n* [cached zip archives](https://prometheus-app.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h\u0026g0.expr=gitlab_pages_zip_cached_archives\u0026g0.tab=0)\n    * basically number of projects which recently were served by zip architecture and cached(for 1 minute). Started to grow after 5% rollout. We think that gradual increase can be explained by the usual increase of pages users over the time of day. More people use pages - more projects stay in cache.\n* [cache hits/misses](https://prometheus-app.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1h\u0026g0.expr=gitlab_pages_zip_cache_requests\u0026g0.tab=1)\n* [open archives count](https://prometheus-app.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=24h\u0026g0.expr=increase(gitlab_pages_zip_opened%5B5m%5D)\u0026g0.tab=0)\n    * same as cached_zip_archives, but without cache. So this counts individual project accessed regardless of cache. Jumped after 5% rollout and stayed at almost the same level, which is expected.\n* [vfs operations total ZIP vs Local](https://prometheus-app.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=6h\u0026g0.stacked=1\u0026g0.expr=sum(increase(gitlab_pages_vfs_operations_total%5B5m%5D))%20by%20(vfs_name)\u0026g0.tab=0)\n    * show disk operations performed on ZIP vfs(object storage) vs local disk.

users to gain more context about an epic within the epic board","description":"### 2021-05-18\n\nFor this issue to be completed, the **Ancestors** component needs to be added to the epic board sidebar.\n\n\n### Problem to solve\n\u003e When facilitating planning at scale across many teams or groups within my organization, I want a high level view of how my epics are moving through a workflow, so that I can track and report on the progress of features and initiatives.\n\nHow might we allow users to view more context and quickly edit an individual epic within their board?\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers can quickly learn more about an epic in their board and change values like `due date` etc.\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement a sidebar similar to the issue sidebar on issue boards for MVC. See the design tab for all iterations and ideation.\n\n| Bare MVC iteration | More fleshed out iteration |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|![Iteration_1_epic_board_sidebar](/uploads/7488b7e52b58706457170cd86b656d70/Iteration_1_epic_board_sidebar.png)| ![Iteration_2_b](/uploads/3ef8229c05e956986290fd7f7280ec1e/Iteration_2_b.png) |\n\n\n**Figma:** https://www.figma.com/file/BGUo9MG09v2ZlQjnPynALr/231401-Allow-users-to-gain-more-context-about-an-epic-within-the-epic-board?node-id=1%3A45039\n\n##### Epic sidebar drawer, including:\n- 🟡 Iteration 1: Ability to open and close \"Epic details\" drawer\n   - Stretch styling: Enlarge header/title to `ui/h2/04 base`. This was intended but never included in the component I believe.\n   - Stretch styling: Change background of all these drawers to `$gray-10`\n   - Stretch styling: I reduced the width of the drawer here to `288 px` to display content, esp dropdowns, without a bunch of added width. :thinking: Maybe we can play with this a bit @fguibert \n   - Stretch styling: `Edit` buttons should be tertiary. I placed the `12px` instead of `16px` from top of the div here to account for the slight alignment wonkiness when using these buttons inline with text.\n\n- 🟡 Iteration 1: Epic title (wraps to next line if long)\n      - Stretch styling: Allow editing (since the awesome Florie already did this). Increase text box height on `Edit` to `64px` for all title editing since most epic and especially issue titles are quite long.\n- 🟡 Iteration 1: Identifier (this is part of title :white_check_mark: ) \n- 🟡 Iteration 1: Start date \n      - Stretch styling: The selected date type (the option that is selected, for example `Inherited: #### - ####` should be `$gray-900` similar to other sidebar items with a selected value\n- 🟡 Iteration 1: Due date\n      - Stretch styling: The selected date type (the option that is selected, for example `Inherited: #### - ####` should be `$gray-900` similar to other sidebar items with a selected value\n- 🟡 Iteration 1: Labels \n- 🟡 Iteration 1 or 2: Confidentiality \n      - Stretch styling: Move this under `Labels` and above `Ancestors` in all sidebar views\n- 🟡 Iteration 1 or 2: Ancestors \n- 🟡 Iteration 1 or 2: Toggle to turn notifications on and off\n- 🟡 Iteration 1 or 2: Add a to do \u0026 remove a to do\n- 🟡 Iteration 3: Add participants to issue and epic sidebars in board cc @fguibert @cdybenko \n- The selected epic has a active/focus state similar to the current issue board \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Security Configuration page to link to SAST Configuration UI","description":"This issue tracks the work to link to the [SAST Configuration UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228830) page from the Security Configuration page.\n\nThis work **must** be carried out under the `sast_configuration_ui` feature flag, so that it is available at the same time the SAST Configuration UI page is [enabled](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231357).\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228830#note_384677784 for an on-going discussion about exactly how this page should change visually (if at all).\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Add `configuration_path` property to each of the `features` in [`ee/app/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.2.0-rc44-ee/ee/app/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter.rb#L81) (See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227575#note_378452790 for some context). For all features _except_ SAST, this property would likely just be nil.\n- [ ] Update the [configuration table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.2.0-rc44-ee/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/components/app.vue#L172-187) to link to the given feature's `configuration_ui`, _if it exists_ on the `feature`.\n- [ ] For %13.3, the requirement that the project must have a `.gitlab-ci.yml` before a user can create a SAST merge request has been lifted. See this [code TODO](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v13.2.0-rc44-ee/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/components/app.vue#L122-127).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-23T17:46:34.659Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T11:47:28.660Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T11:47:28.630Z","closed_by":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Deliverable","devops::secure","frontend","group::static analysis","sub-issue","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"}],"author":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231373","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231373","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231373/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/231373/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#231373","relative":"#231373","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#231373"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3659,"epic":{"id":70931,"iid":3659,"title":"SAST Config UI Page - Basic SAST Wide Settings","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3659","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"}]
