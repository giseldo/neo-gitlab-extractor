[{"id":28833210,"iid":118671,"project_id":278964,"title":"MVC: Apply compliance framework labels to projects","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCompliance-minded organizations rely on services like GitLab to surface insights about their environment to achieve certain goals. A top-of-mind goal for many of our customers is managing the compliance of their GitLab projects. Currently, there's no easy way to determine the compliance status of projects, let alone a way to easily view this status in aggregate. There's no mechanism to identify a project as one that has certain compliance requirements or additional oversight, which is a fundamental need to tracking compliance status.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* All management stakeholders who adhere to any auditing process. For example in a finance institution (Security, Quality, Development department heads)\n\n### Further details\n\nThe original [discovery issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36300) for this issue provided valuable insight into our direction and allowed us to determine the better MVC for this feature.\n\nGiven light of new learnings from our research with customers, we've pivoted this MVC to a more appropriate first iteration.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a new `Project Setting`, which is a pre-defined list of compliance frameworks, to enable customers to identify projects as compliant with those specific frameworks.\n\nThe list should initially contain the following frameworks:\n\n* `SOX` (Sarbanes-Oxley)\n* `SOC 2` (Service Organization Control 2)\n* `PCI-DSS` (Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard)\n* `HIPAA` (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)\n* `GDPR` (General Data Protection Regulation)\n* ~~`NIST` (National Institute of Standards and Technology)~~\n* ~~`ISO` (International Organization for Standardization)~~\n\nThis selection should only permit **one** option to be chosen for now.\n\nThe proposed workflow is:\n\n1. An `admin` or `group owner` selects `SOX` in `Project A` settings\n2. The specific compliance label is rendered on the `project list` as a badge\n3. GitLab stores this association to report on in the [Compliance Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2537)\n\n## Screenshots\n\n| Project Settings-BEFORE | Project Settings-AFTER |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Project_Settings-Before](/uploads/fdaf5e6e67d1314e2897bf097476f08c/Project_Settings-Before.png) | ![Project_Settings-After](/uploads/64ad9f2f31dae4dc875f412498baa50e/Project_Settings-After.png) |\n\n| Project Details-BEFORE | Project Details-AFTER |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Project_Details-Before](/uploads/fa13db20b7b0a4d3760bcd468a26186e/Project_Details-Before.png) | ![Project_Details-After](/uploads/a45551f308d66aaa7efe013805459b7a/Project_Details-After.png) |\n\n| Projects listing-BEFORE | Projects listing-AFTER |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Project_Listing-Before](/uploads/01f3c3b304f148e9ec8c37dd6fbeab05/Project_Listing-Before.png) | ![Project_Listing-After](/uploads/5f33dda9e116fc35c1176882618a6d25/Project_Listing-After.png) |\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003eOriginal proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\nAdd a **Compliance Controls** selection capability to the `Group` settings. The MVC selection could be GCF [Change Management 2.01 (CM.2.01)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/guidance/CM.2.01_segregation_of_duties.html) for Separation of Duties.\n\nHelper text should indicate that GCF CM.2.01 is \"aligned with SOC 2 CC8.1 and PCI-DSS 6.4\".\n\nOn the backend, GitLab should attribute specific settings to \"compliance\" with this control. For example, the following settings being **enabled** are considered \"compliant\":\n\n- [X] Remove all approvals in a merge request when new commits are pushed to its source branch\n- [X] Prevent approval of merge requests by merge request author\n- [X] Prevent approval of merge requests by merge request committers\n\nIf these settings are enabled at the time of a MR approval, the MR widget should show a **positive indicator** (:white_check_mark:)\n\nIf 1 or more of these settings is disabled, the MR widget should show a **warning indicator** (:warning:)\n\n| Group Settings | MR Widget |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Settings-Group_Level](/uploads/daaf36d183d138f1cc0f3ea4d9db99c5/Settings-Group_Level.png) | ![4](/uploads/09459d097b10b9398ab52b098898bd1b/4.png) |\n| A settings area to specify the desired Compliance Controls to implement for a `Group`. |  | \n\n\u003c!--\nSelecting this control should add a MR widget notice that reports on the project's MR approvals settings. As demonstrated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34830, we can provide a policy report notice to explicitly confirm:\n\n* A MR author was not an approver\n* Someone with commits in the MR was not an approver\n* Approvers were not overridden when the MR was created\n* The test and production environments are separate\n\nThis setting should be editable only by `Owners`\n\nCreate a `project template` `Group Owners` can apply to all new `Projects` created in their group. The project template would simply set the appropriate setting(s) to restrict modification of MR approvals at the project-level to only `Owners`. This would both provide consistency with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/38051, but make compliance, in this particular case, more seamless.\n\nAdditional or Alternative MVC \"starting points\":\n\n*This suggests a few places to start with an MVC and does not mean we would implement all of the features below as part of this MVC*\n\n* Code reviews must pass DAST, SAST, dependency, and license scanning\n* Vulnerabilities with a Low or Medium impact identified during a merge request should be remediated or accepted with justification\n* Vulnerabilities with a High or Critical impact identified during a merge request must be remediated\n* Merge requests that impact critical systems must undergo a Risk Assessment\n--\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-17T15:59:14.497Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T21:10:06.822Z","closed_at":"2020-05-04T12:59:55.697Z","closed_by":{"id":5209897,"username":"rob.hunt","name":"Robert Hunt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5209897/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rob.hunt"},"labels":["Category:Compliance Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Kickoff Highlight","UX","backend","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","frontend","group::compliance","priority::1","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},{"id":5209897,"username":"rob.hunt","name":"Robert Hunt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5209897/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rob.hunt"}],"author":{"id":4748651,"username":"mattgonzales-gitlab","name":"Matt Gonzales (ex-GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748651/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mattgonzales-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3468028,"username":"jiaan","name":"Jiaan Louw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3468028/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jiaan"},"user_notes_count":139,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118671","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118671","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118671/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118671/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#118671","relative":"#118671","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#118671"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2423,"epic":{"id":17593,"iid":2423,"title":"Compliance Management: Viable Maturity","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2423","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28828799,"iid":118658,"project_id":278964,"title":"Transient failure in ee/spec/features/boards/boards_spec.rb:221","description":"Job [#381758214](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs/381758214) failed for 467b0e70ed2ea37ea5342f1a37b96bd7dc8f7c8d:\n\n```\n2175   1) issue boards list settings When FF is turned off does not show the list settings button\n2176      Got 1 failure and 1 other error:\n2177      1.1) Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_no_selector(:button, \"List Settings\")\n2178             expected not to find visible button \"List Settings\" that is not disabled, found 1 match: \"\"\n2179           #

The check proposed in this issue would check if a user is semantically correctly using the `$CI_COMMIT_TAG`. Without this code the pipeline would just not execute the job if it was not correctly configured.\n\nAFAIK we don't currently perform these types of checks for other variables, and to take this step takes us more into the area of guessing what the user might intend with the pipeline.\n\nSuch error could be useful to a user when the cannot work out why a pipeline is not behaving as expected.

The selected designs are cleared when this `@done` event is being emitted, but because it's _not_ being emitted, the `index`-level Vue component still thinks designs are selected, hence why it is in it's active state.\n\nThe reason `@done` isn't emitted can be traced to `ee/app/assets/javascripts/design_management/utils/cache_update.js` Line 16:\n\n```js\ndata.project.issue.designCollection.designs.edges = [...changedDesigns];\n```\n\nCommenting this out (while breaking the functionality), results in `@done` being emitted. So, I assume it's something to due with the particular way in which we're mutating the cache here doesn't play well with Apollo.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-17T07:01:21.839Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T18:59:19.157Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T10:05:25.745Z","closed_by":{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"},"labels":["Category:Design Management","Enterprise Edition","devops::plan","frontend","group::product planning","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"}],"author":{"id":259327,"username":"tomquirk","name":"Tom Quirk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/259327/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tomquirk"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2950912,"username":"ntepluhina","name":"Natalia Tepluhina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2950912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ntepluhina"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118627","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118627","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118627/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118627/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#118627","relative":"#118627","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#118627"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28808378,"iid":118624,"project_id":278964,"title":"Vault integration PoC: Rails for handling credentials/secrets/token","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\nGiven the Runner team is highly-constrained, we are investigating a Rails implementation of the feature proposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/28321 which was intended for Runner.\n\n### In Scope\n\n*  Research and document the risks/concerns around implementing the credentials and fetch of the temporary token first in Rails instead of inside the Runner\n*  Determine how to secure Rails handling of Vault credentials\n*  Technical approach for getting the secret and passing the temporary token to the Runner \n*  Review findings of discovery re authentication methods to Vault previously completed in [Vault integration for CI/CD proof-of-concept](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/9981) \n\n\n### Out of Scope\n\n*  Feature implementation in Rails for Vault integration\n*  Exploration of how the final Vault interaction will integrate or replace existing GitLab secret variables\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Add a user at project level as `maintainer` but don't give any access at group level.  \n2. Now login as above user with maintainer role in project  \n3. Go to `https://gitlab.com/\u003cGroupName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e/edit` and EDIT any of your project level badge. You wont see EDIT button next to group badges as you dont have any permissions to EDIT it.  \n4. When you EDIT and save project Badges, you will see below request\n\n```  \nPUT /api/v4/projects/15203433/badges/\u003cBadge_ID\u003e HTTP/1.1  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nConnection: close  \nContent-Length: 149  \nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*  \nOrigin: https://gitlab.com  \nX-CSRF-Token: ████  \nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.108 Safari/537.36  \nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8  \nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin  \nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors  \nReferer: https://gitlab.com/groupfor1/1projectfor/edit  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nAccept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8  \nCookie: ████\n\n{\"name\":\"CCC\",\"image_url\":\"https://gitlab.com/%{project_path}/badges/%{default_branch}/pipeline.svg\",\"link_url\":\"https://gitlab.com/%{project_path}\"}  \n```\n\n5. Just change the `\u003cBadge_ID\u003e` in URL with group badge and send the request `PUT /api/v4/projects/15203433/badges/\u003cBadge_ID\u003e HTTP/1.1`  \n6. This will successfully change the group level badge!\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nProject Maintainer can change group badges without any access to group\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nProject Maintainer shouldn't be allowed to change group level badges\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com. Tested on public group private project but it should work for private group private projects too\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n## Impact\n\nProject Maintainers can change group level badges","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-16T19:39:05.229Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T15:04:00.751Z","closed_at":"2020-09-03T07:36:52.551Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-03-23","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118536","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118536","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118536/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/118536/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#118536","relative":"#118536","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#118536"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28781903,"iid":118500,"project_id":278964,"title":"Enable clearMocks in Jest configuration","description":"## Description\n\nLet's set [`clearMocks`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#clearmocks-boolean) to `true` in our Jest configuration.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- This way tests don't bump into eachother.\n- There's a lot of confusion between `clear`, `restore`, and `reset` when developers manually add the `clear`.

limits on size of diffs returned by the /projects/:id/repository/compare API endpoint","description":"### Summary\r\n\r\nThe `/projects/:id/repository/compare` API endpoint will attempt to return arbitrarily large diffs.  When the comparison is particularly big this will cause the request to exceed the Gitaly timeout and a 500 error is returned.  Although the Gitaly request is hitting its deadline, we found that most of the time is spent waiting for Rails to render the diffs.\r\n\r\nThe customer reporting this issue received as 21 MB response once they raised their gitaly timeout to \u003e 180 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project and add a large file such as a 1,000,000 line csv\r\n1. Create a new branch `big-diff` and make a schema change to the csv like adding quotes around a column\r\n1. Commit the change\r\n1. Execute `curl -H \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cTOKEN\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cPROJ_NUM\u003e/repository/compare?from=master\u0026to=other\"`, the response will be `{\"message\":\"500 Internal Server Error\"}`\r\n\r\n### Example Project\r\n\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/wchandler/big-diff\r\n\r\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\r\n\r\nThe `compare` endpoint will attempt to render an unbounded amount of diffs, resulting in the job being killed\r\n\r\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\r\n\r\nThe length of diffs to render should have a maximum length, as we currently do in the UI and the `/projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/changes` API endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Relevant logs and/or

when pipeline succeeds button visible for non maintainer","description":"### Summary\n\nThe 'Merge when pipeline succeeds' button appeared on one of my MR's even though I don't have maintainer rights for the repo.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nNot :100: sure, I had had the tab open for a while and had pushed changes to the branch, I noticed the 'new changes were added' message but also that there was a enabled button for merging.\n\n### Example Project\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe 'Merge when pipeline succeeds' button is visible and clickable\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI should see a 'merge' button greyed out and unclickable\n\n### Relevant logs and/or

median calculation, part of the change included returning the median value as a integer in seconds, previously the median used [`distance_of_time_in_words` to convert to an approximate time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19278#note_254863746). This adds similar functionality to the FE.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Adds a `limitToDays` option to the parseSeconds function\\r\\n* Adds an `approximateDuration` function to mimic [distance_of_time_in_words](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.1/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-distance_of_time_in_words).

This is fairly urgent as it can have an impact on availability. It is a follow-up from \"Implement external validation during pipeline creation\", where the following discussion from !21134 should be addressed:\n\n- @ayufan started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21134#note_260151441):  (+3 comments)\n\n    \u003e I just wonder, if we should log all validations results @matteeyah. WDYT?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Maybe this is something not really required? Will this be a problem for the production team to debug when something will not work? Will Sentry/exceptions log be enough?\n\n- @matteeyah \n\n    \u003e It depends on what is being debugged - if it's the validation mechanism itself (e.g. we expect a pipeline to pass validation but it doesn't) then this is related to debugging the external service. This should be logged in the external service and debugged there.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e It's highly unlikely that the external service validates properly but we don't parse the response properly since we don't really do anything other than read the response code. If there's a configuration error, the URL doesn't exist or its timing out, this will be caught and logged in Sentry.\n    \u003e\n    \u003e Either way we could add additional logging later on if we decide what we have here isn't enough.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-14T09:05:49.693Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T10:46:49.791Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T14:22:07.554Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","Verify::P1","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","infradev","maintenance::refactor","missed:12.7","missed:12.9","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"}],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":722076,"username":"matteeyah","name":"Matija Čupić","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bc04cc15e0adba406cf56fecd9d910a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matteeyah"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/55694","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/55694","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/55694/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/55694/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#55694","relative":"#55694","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#55694"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28650221,"iid":55677,"project_id":278964,"title":"Implement auto-saving mechanism on Design Notes","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nSometimes we start writing a note on a Design and we stop half-way, switch tabs and then lose it... when we get back to that Design and start replying, it would be nice to have the content still there.\n\nThis is the behavior we have in comments for Issues and Merge Requests.

https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\nWe have several places that could benefit from the component on notes becoming more generic, namely:\n\n* Snippets\n* Design Management Notes\n* (Potentially more places where we use Vue)\n\n## Risks\n\nCreating yet another version of Emoji components.\n\nBeware of existing discussions around exposing awarded Emoji via GraphQL.\n\n## Involved components\n\n[`app/assets/javascripts/notes/components/note_awards_list.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/notes/components/note_awards_list.vue#L174)\n\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\nEasy to use a component that lists the awarded emoji, as well as an up-to-date list of emoji to be selected and awarded to a given object.\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them

In addition, many private packages may depend on those public packages.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Use cases\nThe primary use case is for organizations that publish both public and private scoped packages, where their private npm packages depend on their public npm packages, that utilize the GitLab group and project as their scope.\n\n#### Implementation\n- This feature is in-line with our goals for the [Dependency Proxy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/), which proxies and caches Docker images for use in CI/CD and helps with faster, more reliable builds. We will evaluate if this can be done via the Dependency Proxy or if there is a faster path to value by just creating multiple remotes.\n\n#### Examples\nFor example, let's assume that the gitlab root namespace is `acme`, found at https://gitlab.com/acme, that there's a private project at https://gitlab.com/acme/child, and that that project depends on a public npm package `@acme/parent`.  The name of the child project, to be compliant with gitlab.com's requirements, must use scope `@acme`, and is recommended to be `@acme/child`.\n\nAssume the `.gitlab-ci.yml` looks like the following:\n\n```\n.authenticate-to-npmjs:\n  - \u0026authenticate-to-npmjs |\n    echo \"$NPM_SCOPE:registry=https://$NPM_REGISTRY_HOST_PATH\" \u003e\u003e ~/.npmrc\n    echo \"//$NPM_REGISTRY_HOST_PATH:_authToken=$NPM_WRITE_TOKEN\" \u003e\u003e ~/.npmrc\n    echo \"//$NPM_PROJECT_HOST_PATH_PREFIX$CI_PROJECT_ID$NPM_PROJECT_HOST_PATH_SUFFIX:_authToken=$NPM_WRITE_TOKEN\" \u003e\u003e ~/.npmrc\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - publish\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  image: node:8-alpine\n  script:\n    - npm run build\n\npublish:\n  stage: publish\n  image: node:8-alpine\n  script:\n    - *authenticate-to-npmjs\n    - npm install\n    - npm run make-distribution # invokes babel transpilation to lib/main\n    - cd lib/main\n    - npm publish --access restricted\n  only:\n    - /^([0-9]{1,}\\.[0-9]{1,}\\.[0-9]{1,}(-(pre|rc)\\.[0-9]{1,})?)$/\n```\n\nThe `publish` job fails at `npm install` because gitlab's npm can't find package `@acme/parent`; it's in the global npm registry, not the gitlab private npm registry.  The gitlab.com npm registry should forward requests for missing scoped packages to the global npm registry.\n\n\n### Proposal\nAllow users of the NPM Registry to forward scoped package requests to the global npm registry when the package is not found in the gitlab private registry. \n- [By default this feature should be enabled](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#principles)\n- Give users the ability to disable this feature from within the user interface\n- Count number of packages pulled/pushed and distinguish between GitLab NPM Registry and npmjs.org\n\n#### User interface\n![Screenshot_2020-02-13_at_10.19.25](/uploads/31d0a73c3db0637a49cbd1d685321444/Screenshot_2020-02-13_at_10.19.25.png)\n\n#### What we are not doing\n- As a first iteration, we will limit the scope to one additional remote. However, in the future we may allow users to add multiple remotes. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n- Developers and above can enable and disable this feature\n\n### Documentation\n- [NPM Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/)\n\n### Testing\n\nAutomated testing of this feature is possible.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nIn the gitlab.com CI/CD pipeline, npm \u0026 yarn, when installing dependencies for a private, scoped package, should be able to resolve a public package with the same scope in the gitlab.com CI/CD pipeline.\n\n#### Metrics\n- Count number of requests that are sent to GitLab NPM Registry vs. npmjs.org\n- Measure ratio of the above\n- We can utilize this data to better understand the priority and use cases for the Dependency Proxy.\n\n### Links / references\n* https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/npm_registry/#package-naming-convention\n*

merge request is changed to another protected branch, the approver list by code owners is not updated until a new commit to source branch.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a new project in GitLab EE with proper license.\n1. Create new branches of `subint` and `child`.\n1. Enable \"Protected Branches approval by Code Owners\" on protected branches of `master` and `subint*`.\n1. Create `CODEOWNERS` file under root of the repository. Make a specific file/directory owned by different user on `master` and `subint1`.\n1. Make change to above mentioned specific file on `child` branch.\n1. Create a merge request between `child` and `subint1`.\n1. Update the target branch of above merge request to `master`.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/xiaogang_gitlab/code-owner-approval-example/merge_requests/1\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nApprover list is not updated after target branch changes. When a new commit is added to source branch the approver list gets updated to align with new target branch.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nApprover list gets updated immediately once the target branch is changed.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nN/A\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis happens on gitlab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment

and then wait for all existing jobs to finish.\n\nAnd an ungracefully killed Sidekiq:\n\n* may orphan a lease\n* may cause bad data\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Don't add new jobs that run long (ideally exit in 25 seconds, but if not, then the shorter the better.)\n1. ~~If we introduce reusable code to handle scheduler-like situations, we should try to~~ (Edit: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22031 was merged.)

Could we make the API compatible with Sourcegraph so that there is a consistent experience for customers already using Sourcegraph?\n\nThe outcome of this issue should be a list of issues to be

timestamp format in log files","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe log files use a variety of different timestamp formats.  This inconsistency complicates parsing (and sometimes even reading) the logfiles.  For example:\n\n- Human date, military time\n   - application.log: May 23, 2018 09:56\n- ISO 8601\n   - Gitaly: 2018-05-23T13:41:10Z\n   - Pages: 2018-05-23T11:14:50Z\n- ISO 8601.3\n   - api_json: 2018-05-23T15:47:07.471Z\n   - geo: 2018-05-23T16:04:23.624Z\n   - production_json: 2018-05-23T15:24:23.915Z\n- ISO 8601.6\n   - sidekiq: 2018-05-23T14:40:00.808Z\n   - unicorn_stderr: 2015-02-13T06:14:46.680381\n- ISO 8601+timezone\n   - gitlab-shell: 2018-05-23T15:45:56+00:00\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\n- This was extracted from [the issue to implement JSON logging for application.log](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22812).\n- This falls within GitLab's ongoing [effort to implement structured logging](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/469).\n\n### Proposal\n\nAll log files should use the \"ISO 8601.3\" format.  This is already the most widely used format, by intention.  ([@stanhu said](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22812#note_215168499): \"I've been using `timestamp.utc.iso8601(3)` in all the logs that I've touched (production_json.log, api_json.log, geo.log, Sidekiq, etc.)\")  The following logs should be adjusted to use \"ISO 8601.3\" format:\n\n- [x] application.log (MR !22793)\n- [ ] gitlab-shell\n- [ ] Gitaly\n- [ ] Pages\n- [x] sidekiq (MR !21835)\n- [ ] unicorn_stderr.log\n\n### Testing\n\nChanging the timestamp format could disrupt log-monitoring tools that have been set up on self-hosted instances.  This is especially true for structured log files, which are more likely to be monitored.\n\n### Related issues\n\n- [Implement json logging for application.log](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22812)\n- [Consider dropping unstructured rails logs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/23070)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-12T19:48:26.606Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T22:24:57.881Z","closed_at":"2020-02-05T21:48:51.492Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","estimation::needed","group::optimize","priority::2","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4158075,"username":"aakriti.gupta","name":"Aakriti Gupta","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/992a080bc7d9f8c22ff7186db1c76dbd?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aakriti.gupta"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4158075,"username":"aakriti.gupta","name":"Aakriti Gupta","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/992a080bc7d9f8c22ff7186db1c76dbd?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aakriti.gupta"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/43422","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":2},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/43422","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/43422/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/43422/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#43422","relative":"#43422","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#43422"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":469,"epic":{"id":1438,"iid":469,"title":"Structured logging","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/469","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28420391,"iid":43319,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Update merge results/trains pipelines QA test\"","description":"The following discussion from !21530 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @mlapierre started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21530#note_259119308):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e I know this is a weird name, but yeah, it merges a merge train MR immediately instead of waiting for the merge train to complete.\n\n    @niskhakova https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21530#note_259427638\n\n    \u003e Indeed that's a problem.

Without the anonymous visual review flag set the endpoint to send anonymous feedback returns `{\"message\":\"403 Forbidden  - Anonymous visual review feedback is disabled\"}`, as expected.\n\nWhen we enable this flag, the endpoint returns a 404 error code. All the configuration is set correctly.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a private or internal project on a private Gitlab instance\n2. Enable the anonymous visual review feature flag\n3. Try and add anonymous feedback\n4. See that it does not work\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe should be able to add feedback to private and internal projects.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a new `require-authentication='true'` data parameter to the script tag. This will re-enable the visual reviews for private/internal projects and users will add their PAT to leave feedback.\n\nThis will also enable public project maintainers to require a PAT for visual review feedback on their projects if they so desire.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-12T15:16:21.288Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T17:28:12.561Z","closed_at":"2020-04-21T08:31:20.850Z","closed_by":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"labels":["Category:Review Apps","Deliverable","Verify::P1","customer","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","missed-SLO","priority::2","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"}],"author":{"id":263575,"username":"tom6","name":"Tom Forbes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/386ab8b63b53ec2cbb58563253557f57?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tom6"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"user_notes_count":52,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/42750","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/42750","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/42750/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/42750/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#42750","relative":"#42750","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#42750"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28395757,"iid":42736,"project_id":278964,"title":"Forks count cache is not properly refreshed when forking projects","description":"### Problem\n\nRight after successfully forking a project I noticed the amount of forks of the original project wasn't being updated:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-12-12_at_10.39.10](/uploads/87f206d9f89305a1742f64e4d73cfbc9/Screen_Shot_2019-12-12_at_10.39.10.png)\n\nThat happens given the cache is only refreshed if we mark some project as a fork of another.

update API allows setting null as updated_at which seems to be invalid","description":"### Summary\n\nUsing the Issue update API as an admin permits setting the `updated_at` field, setting the value `null` appears to fail with a 500, but then some issue features break with a 500 as well.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWith an admin-powered private token:\n\n```sh\ncurl \\\n  -XPOST \\\n  -H 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: secret' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"iid\":2051,\"title\":\"Test\"}' \\\n  https://gitlab.acme.com/api/v4/projects/180/issues\n\ncurl \\\n  -XPUT \\\n  -H 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: secret' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"title\":\"Updated\",\"updated_at\":null}' \\\n  https://gitlab.acme.com/api/v4/projects/180/issues/2051\n```\n\nNavigate to the issues page of the project or post comments with the API.\n\nGitLab returns a 500 error.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API allows saving an invalid (?) `null` value as `updated_at` which seems to break other issue features.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe update API should fail the call with a 400 and not update any data.\n\n-or-\n\nThe issue list page and note creation API should not break when `updated_at` is `null`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eproduction.log\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```\nStarted PUT \"/api/v4/projects/180/issues/2051\" for 192.168.98.128 at 2019-12-12 00:11:10

(Which may be true for java web applications).\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/stendler/example-gemnasium-maven-analyzer\n\nPipeline: https://gitlab.com/stendler/example-gemnasium-maven-analyzer/pipelines/102385417/builds\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe pipeline creates two jobs:\n- gemnasium-dependency_scanning\n- gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning\n\nWith gemnasium-dependency_scanning always failing in my case.

In that case, the deletion job will run unsuccessfully, every day, forever.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIf a scheduled group deletion job finds that the triggering user has been removed from the group, the job should be deleted.\n\nThis proposal is not perfect because generally, if an action is permitted, then its results should be permitted. This proposal represents an exception to that rule: an action is permitted, then the results are not. We believe this is appropriate because the results are highly destructive. A highly destructive result should not occur if there is *any* indication it is malicious or mistaken.\n\nThis proposal is also not perfect because the deletion job is silently deleted. In a future enhancement we may introduce some sort of admin notification for this circumstance.\n\n### Related links\n\n* This problem was identified by @ifarkas in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19679#note_258601181\n* The same problem exists with projects: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39204\n\n### Further details\n\nThe issue requires addressing 2 problems:\n\n1. Delete group only if the deletion user has access to the group while the actual deletion occurs\n\n   While deleting a group via adjourned deletion, we do not currently check whether the user has access to the group. Implying groups are deleted with no right access and could be serious problem in certain cases - for e.g. an employee schedules their Organization\u0026#39;s group for deletion before leaving the company, and the group gets deleted even after the employee was removed from the group.\n\n   Before deleting the group, the projects within the group are [deleted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/groups/destroy_service.rb#L18).\n\n   In the event that a user was removed from the group, the deletion of the projects within the group will [fail](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/projects/destroy_service.rb#L22), causing the [`DestroyError`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/groups/destroy_service.rb#L19) exception to be raised.\n\n   Since `DestroyError` is a type of [StandardError](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/groups/destroy_service.rb#L5), the job will fail silently.

However, the 'Guest' role is limited in that it only allows read access to internal and public repositories; reading and cloning from private repositories is not possible by 'Guest' users.\n\nAllowing for an user role which does not consume a license yet still permits read and pull access from private repositories would allow GitLab's customers to pay just for the regularly-used licenses while retaining the flexibility of allowing read access to the code for infrequent limited-scope authenticated users such as partners.\n\nThis would make wise use of money customers pay for GitLab licenses while also increasing the breadth of the GitLab user ecosystem.  \n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow 'Guest' users read and clone access to private repositories.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThe 'Guest' role would need \"View project code\" and \"Pull project code\" enabled.\n\n### Documentation\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n\n### Testing\n\nA risk is that if existing customers have workflows designed around the fact that the 'Guest' role lacks access to private repositories, changing access rights to be more permissive for the 'Guest' role may lead to security issues whereby a previously inaccessible private repository becomes readable.\n\nIf this is a major concern, perhaps adding a brand new role such as 'Guest Plus' rather than modifying the existing 'Guest' role may be preferable.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nImmediate success metrics would be a specific enterprise customer being able to achieve their use case of sharing certain code with partners without incurring additional license fees for those partners.  For long term success metrics, we should expect to see GitLab's footprint grow at organizations with such an use case.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nThis feature would apply to all buyer types from Individual Contributor through Executive.\n\n### Links / references\n\nComment from Sid in Slack discussion:  https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C3MAZRM8W/p1576005251055100?thread_ts=1575985246.045600\u0026channel=C3MAZRM8W\u0026message_ts=1576005251.055100","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-10T23:25:22.253Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T23:17:02.858Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T23:17:02.822Z","closed_by":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Category:Permissions","auto updated","customer","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","potential proposal","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4750109,"username":"yhsueh","name":"Yu-Chen Hsueh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4750109/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/yhsueh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":19,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39463","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/39463","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/39463/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/39463/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#39463","relative":"#39463","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#39463"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28288963,"iid":39458,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow QA tests to be quarantined only in specific environments","description":"### Problem\n\nWhen we quarantine a test it is quarantined everywhere it runs.

This is not easily deciphered from the report today. We need to solve that gap for Sasha so they can quickly resolve new accessibility issues their change has introduced as early in the development cycle as possible.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who will see the impact of the current MR on a11y of the project.\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer) - who can review the impact of a11y from the MR and provide suggestions for improvements quickly.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe goal of this feature is to solve the problem of too much information that isn't actionable that may come from a full accessibility report. Sasha and Presley only want to make sure the change in the Merge Request is not degrading the accessibility of the project. If the change does degrade the accessibility then they want actionable information on how to fix it. This may happen as part of initial development OR in a design review prior to Merge of the code.\n\nThis is part of the work that moves the ~\"Category:Accessibility Testing\" to ~\"maturity::viable\".\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n#### Goals\nThis iterates on the [a11y MVC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/25566) by bringing the difference of the latest scan vs. the last scan of /master into the context of the MR. The Outcome(s) for this are as follows:\n- When I build code, I want to see the changes to a11y in the context of the MR, so that features I release can be used by everyone.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nBuilding on the MVC that made a .json file available and the previous pattern of code quality that compares the report of the new branch to the base branch display the changes between the two in a widget on the Merge Request page.\n\nA link to the full report (or downloadable artifact) from the widget should be provided.\n\nThe widget should be minimized on page load but with an indicator that improvements/degradations have been found.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Update existing [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/accessibility_testing.html) for setup for MR widget and any caveats for comparison (artifact expiration, need for two, etc.) to appear.\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose?

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* MR Widget is displayed when a11y job is included.\n  * Improvements and degradations have their own visual indicators\n  * If the diff cannot be generated display a tooltip similar to the code quality pattern.\n  * Provide a link to the information from the pa11y report about the issue found.\n* Track usage of the feature\n  * Provide a count of how many times the MR widget is displayed to be queried in Periscope\n  * Provide a count of how many times the MR Widget is expanded to be queried in Periscope\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Besides, it has to be scoped for projects. Therefore, instead of checking if the feature flag is enabled or not (`Feature.enabled?(:version_snippets)`), we will check if the feature flag is enabled for specific projects (`Feature.enabled?(:version_snippets, project)`). This way, for testing purposes, we can enable the feature flag on the project `gitlab-org/gitlab` for example, instead of enabling it globally.\n\nThis issue is about adding content (create commits) in the snippet repository. We will be able to do this through:\n\n- The UI when the user creates a snippet with content or when the user updates the content or add new files.\n- When the user pushes to the snippet repository.\n\nWhen the user uses the UI, we will have to user the method `repository.multi_action` with the proper `git` action, the content, and the commit message. \n\nBased on the repository routes, we have to finally decide if the assert and the decision made in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39176 was right or not:\n\n\u003e The new snippet repositories will be stored inside the same hashed directory as the project, wiki, and design management repository. Nevertheless, we need to scope them somehow because compare to the other types of repositories, we can have several snippet repositories in the same place as the other repositories.\n\nAnother important point is that the file names in snippets can be optional. This means that, when we save the file, we have to automatically give some sort of default name like `snippetfile1.txt` or something similar.\n\nThis issue depends on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39176 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39199 to be implemented first.\n\n## Availability and Testing\nThis should be covered by adjusting (if necessary) the existing E2E create_snippet_spec.rb","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-10T16:03:26.448Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T07:07:54.246Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T10:27:11.665Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","direction","group::editor","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39265","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/39265","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/39265/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/39265/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#39265","relative":"#39265","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#39265"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":239,"epic":{"id":470,"iid":239,"title":"Version control for snippets","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/239","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":28277292,"iid":39257,"project_id":278964,"title":"Epic: Can't remove newly created child epic","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen you create a new child epic, you cannot remove it before refreshing the page\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.
