[{"id":101860973,"iid":351979,"project_id":278964,"title":"Spike: Draft technical plan to migrate Snowplow events dispatch method to be definitions-powered","description":"### Background\n\nAfter completing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346751, we need to determine how to organize and proceed with the migration.\n\n### Goals\n\n1. Draft a detailed list of steps to update the method for each type of Snowplow event.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSome of the events are missing an event definition. A minimal one can be created by providing the event taxonomy without the ownership-related data: `product_section`, `product_stage`, `product_group`, `product_category`, `milestone`. This would allow us to create new event definitions without a bottleneck.\n\n#### For backend events\n\nRequirements: none.\n\nBy far the easiest one: \n\n1. Replace the ´event´ method with `definition`.\n2. Replace the two required parameters (`category`, `action`) with a single definition `basename` parameter. And it would use the strings defined in the event definition.\n3. If either the `category` and/or `action` are variable, we can provide them via named parameters.\n\n```diff\n- Gitlab::Tracking.event(self.class.to_s, name, namespace: tracking_namespace_source, user: current_user)\n+ Gitlab::Tracking.definition(definition_basename, category: self.class.to_s, namespace: tracking_namespace_source, user: current_user)\n```\n\n#### For frontend events\n\n##### Data attributes\n\n1. Add a `data-track-definition` parameter with the definition `basename`.\n2. Replace the `data-track-category` and/or `data-track-action` attributes, as it would use the strings defined in the event definition.\n3. If either the `-category` and/or `-action` attribute are variable, we can provide them as well.\n\n```diff\n- - data_attributes = { 'track-action': 'click_buy_ci_minutes', 'track-label': root_namespace.actual_plan_name, 'track-property': 'user_dropdown' }\n+ - data_attributes = { 'track-definition': '20210915205040_default_generic', 'track-label': root_namespace.actual_plan_name, 'track-property': 'user_dropdown' }\n```\n\n##### Vue events\n\n1. Load the definitions to be used by listing them as a property of the Vue component. So they can be preloaded.\n2. Replace the `this.track` method with `this.trackDefinition`.\n3. Provide the data as usual.\n\n```diff\n@@ -34,6 +34,7 @@ export default {\n   recoveryCodeDownloadFilename: RECOVERY_CODE_DOWNLOAD_FILENAME,\n   i18n,\n   mousetrap: null,\n+  definitions: ['20210915205040_default_generic'],\n   components: { GlSprintf, GlButton, GlAlert, ClipboardButton, GlCard },\n   mixins: [Tracking.mixin()],\n   props: {\n@@ -79,7 +80,7 @@ export default {\n         window.print();\n       }\n \n-      this.track('click_button', { label: `${this.$options.trackingLabelPrefix}${action}_button` });\n+      this.track('20210915205040_default_generic', { label: `${this.$options.trackingLabelPrefix}${action}_button` });\n     },\n     handleKeyboardCopy() {\n       if (!window.getSelection) {\n\n```\n\n##### Raw Javascript\n\n1.

Identify the missing event definitions by browsing the codebase. A round of validation using Sisense might be required.\n1. Determine if we can list these event with the minimal required data (action, category) and treat them as \"incomplete\" or \"in-process\" event definitions.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe process was to search for the [common patterns](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CwChRvItO64e7OmDnUqLgOXjt61MUDGJcRtICGLo7-Q/edit#gid=1745454434) and cross reference the results (not an in-depth comparison) with the CSV export from the [Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/snowplow/).\n\n1. Most of the missing events come from data-attributes definitions on HAML files, most of the new events being introduced are without definitions as well.\n2. We're missing almost all raw javascript event definitions. Luckily these are easy to find.\n3. Creating an minimal event definition is pretty feasible.

group","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nAt the top-level group, if SAML Group Links are used, the group maintainers must ensure they create sufficient group links for *all* users that would sign-in via SAML. If they don't, users that aren't in any linked groups will be able to authenticate successfully but will immediately have their access and SAML identity removed. \n\nThis has caused a lot of customer confusion. For example, a customer might want all their users to be `Minimal Access` or `Developer` level but add a SAML Group Link to cover `Maintainers`. This won't work currently - if they add only a `Maintainer` group then all other users will be removed. They would need to add other groups covering all users within the top-level group.\n\nWith that in mind I think it makes sense to move the user back to the default role if they don't match the given top-level group links. This isn't a security problem because SAML Group Sync only happens when the user has already successfully authenticated via SAML.\n\nThis will create a better experience for users and cause less confusion for GitLab.com admins/maintainers.\n\n\n\u003c!-- Label reminders\nUse the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:14:03.600Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T17:56:34.739Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T15:50:20.084Z","closed_by":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"labels":["GitLab Free","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","Support Priority","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","customer","devops::manage","documentation","feature::enhancement","group::authentication and authorization","missed:14.10","missed:14.9","missed:15.0","quad-planning::complete-no-action","release post item::in review","saml","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"}],"author":{"id":7922794,"username":"gerardo","name":"Gerardo Gutierrez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/107f2254e95c85808cd44699e6f97616?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gerardo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":13356,"username":"dblessing","name":"Drew Blessing","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5bf44866b4eeafa2d8114bfe15da02f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dblessing"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351955","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351955","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351955/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351955/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351955","relative":"#351955","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351955"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101849901,"iid":351953,"project_id":278964,"title":"Merge i18n translations (Mar 2022)","description":"Merge the latest i18n translations from Crowdin on a monthly cadence.\n\nDocumentation available here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/i18n/merging_translations.html\n\n#### ToDo\n* [x] After cloning: update Title, set Milestone, Due date (15th), Related to previous month's issue.\n* [x] After the 1st of the month: assign to yourself, set ~2526320 \n* [x] If needed, configure the [GitLab-Crowdin integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/i18n/merging_translations.html#recreate-the-gitlab-integration-in-crowdin)\n* [x] Kick off a sync from [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gitlab-ee/apps/system/gitlab)\n* [x] Find the [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all\u0026utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026state=opened\u0026author_username=gitlab-crowdin-bot) created by @gitlab-crowdin-bot and associate it with this issue\n* [x] Complete the MR\n* [x] Update the translation levels [data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/i18n.rb#L43) with the latest numbers.

Today, OSS plans are assigned 50,000 CICD minutes with a cost factor of 1.\n\nAfter further [research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350535#note_819784345) into contributions to forks of OSS projects, we learned that some projects have [single contributors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350535#note_819836033) using over 200,000 CICD Minutes in a single contribution, where many projects would expect multiple contributors consuming this quantity of minutes each. \n\n### Proposals for consideration\n\n- A. Update Open Source Plan Minutes to 100,000 instead of 50,000 at a 0.008 cost factor for forks (duration is 12,500,000 minutes vs. 6,250,000; 2X the current duration for minutes consumed by forks) \n- B. Update Open Source Plan cost factor to 0.5 from 1 increasing minutes by project members to 100,000 and reducing duration used by public forks by half.\n\n##### A: Update CICD minute quota to 100k\n\n1. Pros: Incentive for signing up for OSS Program \n1.

If you need to get a block quote to appear in a list, then you have to space it over.  Same way with paragraphs.  You copy/paste something from somewhere else, and if the editor is not doing some type of intelligent indenting, then chances are you may need to shift the entire text - either to the right, or to the left.\n\nHappens all the time when I paste code.  The original code can be very indented, but when I past it in, many times I want to remove some of that indentation, just to make it look cleaner.\n\nAlso, since code lines can be triggered by 4 leading spaces in markdown, being able to paste a line from somewhere and quickly shift right twice saves me from having to add the triple backticks.\n\nThe difficulty comes in choosing what keys to use. In many editors, both `tab`/`shift-tab` and `cmd-]`/`cmd-[` perform the same function - shifting the line or selected text to the right or left. Sometimes, pressing `tab` works for inserting some space, but if any text is selected, it erases it. Or `shift` is used to insert a couple spaces at the insertion point, rather than shifting the entire line.\n\nSo I've found more consistency in `cmd-]`/`cmd-[`, at least for shifting lines.\n\nOf course in a browser, both `tab`/`shift-tab` and `cmd-]`/`cmd-[` have default behaviors.\n\n`tab` takes you to the next accessibility field. I think this is a little harder, usability/accessibility wise, to override.  Once you're done editing a form field, the accessible way to go to the next field is via `tab`\n\nUsing `cmd-]`/`cmd-[` takes you back and forth in the browser history for the browser tab you're currently in.  I feel like these are easier to commandeer in an edit field.  I'm sure there might be a use case for using them when editing a field (maybe toggling back and forth between the previous page and the current one?) but I've found it much less likely.\n\nSo I would propose to use `cmd-]`/`cmd-[` for indenting/shifting text. Not only does this allow you to shift pasted in text, but also allows you to create a sublist easily (along with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23977).\n\n\nRelated to #23978.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-03T16:09:58.025Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T13:22:58.500Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T16:02:35.231Z","closed_by":{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/194645/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/digitalmoksha"},"labels":["devops::plan","documentation","frontend","group::project management","markdown","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/194645/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/digitalmoksha"}],"author":{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/194645/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/digitalmoksha"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/194645/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/digitalmoksha"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351924","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351924","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351924/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351924/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351924","relative":"#351924","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351924"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7653,"epic":{"id":454801,"iid":7653,"title":"Markdown: Improve raw editing in textfields (descriptions, comments, etc)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7653","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101827373,"iid":351915,"project_id":278964,"title":"Experiment: Engineering - MVC add videos to continuous onboarding","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: Experiment Implementation: [description] --\u003e\n\n# Experiment Summary\n\u003c!-- Quick rundown of what is being done --\u003e\nWe believe we can increase trial and feature adoption by including videos in the product experience. To verify this we will run an experiment where the control receives the current continuous onboarding experience and the candidate group has additional links to watch videos that related to specific features. We will measure the success of this experiment by monitoring the click rates on the video links and monitoring of the users that click the links to see if they adopt trials and the specific features at a higher rate than the control.\n\n# Design\n\u003c!-- This should include the contexts that determine the reproducibility (stickiness) of an experiment. This means that if you want the same behavior for a user, the context would be user, or if you want all users when viewing a specific project, the context would be the project being viewed, etc. --\u003e\n\nDesign will be completed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351914\n\n# Rollout strategy\n\u003c!-- This is currently called A/B test, which isn't accurate for multi-variants. Let's call this rollout strategy. It should outline the percentages for variants and if there's more than one step to this, each of those steps and the timing for those steps (e.g. 30 days after initial rollout). --\u003e\n\n50/50 AB test with enrollment at the namespace level at the time that the Continuous Onboarding page is accessed. \n\n# Inclusions and exclusions\n\u003c!-- These would be the rules for which given context (and are limited to context or resolvable at experiment time details) is included or excluded from the test.

I believe the lack of feature parity would make OSS plan behave like a Free plan, with basic features.

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nUsers' Kubernetes clusters can often access GitLab only through a proxy. Until now, the GitLab agent for Kubernetes did not support proxied connections. We added support for extra environment variables to the `agentk` Helm package to support proxied connections.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nSome of our K8S clusters have restricted internet access and must use a Squid proxy to reach the internet The Gitlab K8S agents require internet access and do not have a proxy option.\n\n### Proposal\n\n##### Update the Agent to support the ability to use a proxy for connecting to the internet\n\n- Add support for the industry-standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables? But this might be inconsistent with the fact that everything is configurable via the configuration file. Maybe support both (config in file overrides the env variables)?\n- Configuration should be applied to ALL outbound connections: kas, kubernetes API, Cilium, etc\n\n#####  Document how to use the new functionality\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Some of the business logic in the `ProtectedEnvironmentsController` can be reused for the API.\n\n\u003c!-- Label reminders\nUse the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n--\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-03T02:40:42.823Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:04:25.250Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T19:16:44.386Z","closed_by":{"id":9677998,"username":"cbalane","name":"Chris Balane","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9677998/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cbalane"},"labels":["Category:Environment Management","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","Next Up","Release::P1","auto updated","backend","devops::release","direction","feature::addition","group::release","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":11334402,"username":"ahmed.hemdan","name":"Ahmed Hemdan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11334402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmed.hemdan"}],"author":{"id":4373269,"username":"ali-gitlab","name":"Alishan Ladhani","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4373269/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ali-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11334402,"username":"ahmed.hemdan","name":"Ahmed Hemdan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11334402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmed.hemdan"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351854","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351854","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351854/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351854/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351854","relative":"#351854","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351854"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101778185,"iid":351853,"project_id":278964,"title":"[VSA] Add empty state at the group level when there are no custom value streams","description":"\u003c!-- Before implementing a new empty state solution, make sure to read the \nEmpty State region docs in Pajamas: https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states --\u003e\n\n## Description\n\n\u003c!-- Describe the solution you're proposing for your empty state region. \nInclude links to user research (if applicable). --\u003e\n\nWith [upcoming changes to how the VSA backend works](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341739#note_805888371) we will no longer have a default value stream available for new VSA groups, VSA also currently does not have an \"empty\" state, this is because we have always had an \"in memory\" default value stream available.\n\nThe [empty state region](https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states#configuration-required) guidance in Pajamas recommends the **Configuration required** pattern as the most appropriate solution here.\n\n\u003e #### Configuration required\n\u003e A Configuration required empty state serves as a placeholder for features that need to be configured first, before having the ability to create content.\n\u003e\n\u003e ##### Specifications\n\u003e -

parsing manifests with yet unknown Custom Resources","description":"Hey there,\n\n@nagyv-gitlab \n\nI am in the process of evaluating the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes to move our infrastructure to gitlab.com\nSadly, there seems to be no setting to ignore validation of manifests. This results to the following errors of the agent:\n`Failed to decode GitOps objects`\nand\n`unknown resource types:`\n\nI would propose to have a setting in the agents gitops configuration (or per manifest file) to ignore model validation.\n\nAlso, after the error above my agent log is full of:\n```\n{\"level\":\"error\",\"time\":\"2022-02-01T11:18:28.577Z\",\"msg\":\"GetObjectsToSynchronize failed\",\"mod_name\":\"gitops\",\"project_id\":\"x/x/x/x\",\"agent_id\":x,\"error\":\"rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \\\"transport: failed to write client preface: failed to write msg: failed to close writer: failed to write fin frame: WebSocket closed: received close frame: status = StatusGoingAway and reason = \\\\\\\"Shutting down\\\\\\\"\\\"\"}\n{\"level\":\"error\",\"time\":\"2022-02-01T11:18:28.577Z\",\"msg\":\"Error handling a connection\",\"mod_name\":\"reverse_tunnel\",\"error\":\"Connect(): rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \\\"transport: failed to write client preface: failed to write msg: failed to close writer: failed to write fin frame: WebSocket closed: received close frame: status = StatusGoingAway and reason = \\\\\\\"Shutting down\\\\\\\"\\\"\"}\n```\n(Replaced sensitive data with 'x')\n\nRelated Urls: \n- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/22/gitlab-kubernetes-agent-on-gitlab-com/\n- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/\n\n## Proposal\n\nOk, I've looked at the code and I see what the problem is. We [retry applying the resources](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/bedc020616e9968e47e4ef6c7136beee16b30a6f/internal/module/gitops/agent/sync_worker.go#L35-51), but [parsing them happens outside of that loop](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/bedc020616e9968e47e4ef6c7136beee16b30a6f/internal/module/gitops/agent/synchronizer.go#L81). This needs to be fixed to support this use case.\n\nImplementation/fix thoughts (for engineers): As part of that, when `manifestreader.SetNamespaces()` returns a `UnknownTypesError` error, we should reset the rest mapper (`meta.MaybeResetRESTMapper()`) to refresh the discovery information (registered Kubernetes API types that could have been updated with CRDs) and try again. This can likely be done in the `syncDecoder`. Additionally, we should avoid re-parsing and re-setting namespaces once we have done that successfully (memoize the result).\n\n\u003c!-- Don't edit below this line --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-01T11:25:04.250Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T21:28:37.643Z","closed_at":"2022-07-06T21:28:37.386Z","closed_by":{"id":4088036,"username":"hfyngvason","name":"Hordur Freyr Yngvason","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4088036/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason"},"labels":["candidate::15.0","devops::configure","group::configure","missed:15.0","missed:15.1","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","support request","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":4855585,"username":"ash2k","name":"Mikhail Mazurskiy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3161684bd29f5016064a6c16ccd3bc7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ash2k"}],"author":{"id":971437,"username":"TheMrone","name":"Manuel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0b97b6ee1da479d0d2bedd631ccb5889?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/TheMrone"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4855585,"username":"ash2k","name":"Mikhail Mazurskiy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3161684bd29f5016064a6c16ccd3bc7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ash2k"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351645","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351645","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351645/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351645/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351645","relative":"#351645","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351645"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3329,"epic":{"id":54574,"iid":3329,"title":"GitLab Agent for Kubernetes","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3329","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101644616,"iid":351634,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Cleanup json_limited_encoder","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Cleanup \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to cleanup the `json_limited_encoder` feature flag, after the feature flag has been enabled by default for an appropriate amount of time in production.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Create: Source Code\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_source-code-be`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @igor.drozdov \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n\u003c!-- Any MRs that need to be rolled back?

renewal","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nSaaS customers are being surprised and taken off-guard by Quarterly Subscription reconciliations. Because self-service SaaS customers have not historically been charged true-ups, the QSR process and the fact that they have to pay for overages is totally new. See tickets from customers [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/337).\n\n## Intended users\n\nThis issue is just for SaaS customers.\n\n* Group Owners of a group who have just renewed (manually or auto-renewed) a subscription\n* Only groups enrolled in quarterly subscription reconciliation. See exactly which use cases we're solving for in the [Epic description](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7229#saas-customers).\n\n## Proposal\n\nAfter a subscription has been **renewed (manually or auto-renewed)** for a group in GitLab, send an email to **all** group Owners 1 day after a subscription has been renewed to make them aware of how users are counted and how overages are handled.\n\nWe should send an email to all group Owners (not just the group Owner who purchased the subscription), because all group Owners should be aware of the overage behavior.\n\n### Design\n\n[Design here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347267/designs/Email_to_group_Owners_1_day_after_purchase_with_info_about_QSR.png)\n\n### Email copy\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nSubject line: Managing users in your subscription\n\nDear [customer],\n\nThank you for renewing your GitLab.com subscription! As you get started, we want to make sure you understand some important billing information.\n\nYour subscription cost is based on the maximum number of seats you use during the billing period. If you reach the number of seats in your subscription, you can continue to add users, but GitLab bills you for the overage. These bills occur every quarter.\n\nRead more about quarterly reconciliation in [our product documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.html).\n\nIf you have any questions about this process, [please reach out](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293). We are happy to assist.\n\nThank you for your business!\n\nGitLab Billing Team\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n## Implementation details \n\n### Creating the email template and a mailer\n\n* Create a notification mailer file within app/mailers\n* Create a method named `renewed_subscription_introductory`\n* add a new template `renewed_subscription_introductory.html.haml` for the new email and a corresponding plain text version `user_overage_after_purchase.text.erb` in notification_mailer\n* Create preview template for the new methods\n\n### Scheduling and sending email\n\n* Schedule a sidekiq mailer next day after the new `order.start_date` as soon as the callback is received via Zuora for a renewed subscription.\n* Find customers matching order's zuora_account_id and use email column to send the mails.\n\n### Logging\n\n* Add logs information explaining the steps being performed for future audit.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-31T21:21:41.721Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T19:42:38.179Z","closed_at":"2022-02-14T10:07:32.631Z","closed_by":{"id":4903695,"username":"shreyasagarwal","name":"Shreyas Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b09dfe06a10d119c1b2043c43de680?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shreyasagarwal"},"labels":["Category:Purchase","Duplicate","auto updated","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::purchase","section::fulfillment"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4903695,"username":"shreyasagarwal","name":"Shreyas Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b09dfe06a10d119c1b2043c43de680?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shreyasagarwal"}],"author":{"id":8110789,"username":"tgolubeva","name":"Tatyana Golubeva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8110789/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tgolubeva"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4903695,"username":"shreyasagarwal","name":"Shreyas Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b09dfe06a10d119c1b2043c43de680?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shreyasagarwal"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351612","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351612","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351612/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351612/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351612","relative":"#351612","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351612"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":102396578,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7229,"epic":{"id":401186,"iid":7229,"title":"[QSR] [SaaS] Create transparency about User Overage process at the time of purchase or renewal","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7229","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101620509,"iid":351611,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add metrics to capture visits to Blame view from Global Search results page","description":"Related to #327052.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327052 we added a link to the blame page for code results to help users get to this information faster.

with `error: elastic: Error 429 (Too Many Requests)`. \n\nIt doesn't seem like we are following [elastic's recommendation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/tune-for-indexing-speed.html#multiple-workers-threads). \n\n\u003e Make sure to watch for TOO_MANY_REQUESTS (429) response codes (EsRejectedExecutionException with the Java client), which is the way that Elasticsearch tells you that it cannot keep up with the current indexing rate. \n\nEnabling throttling mechanism was brought up during an interaction with elastic support in [Figure out why Elasticsearch was OOM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199887#note_282625705).\n\nCustomer ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/262214\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI was not able to reproduce it locally, though, possibly because I didn't have enough sidekiq threads.\n\n### Relevant logs

Current workaround\n\n#### Indexing concurrency\n\nIn order to decrease the indexing throughput you can configure [`Bulk request concurrency`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#advanced-search-configuration) in the `Settings` -\u003e `Advanced Search` section. By default it's `10`, but you can put it as low as `1` to reduce the number of concurrent indexing operations.\n\n#### Queue selector\n\n_This is an additional workaround if changing `Indexing concurrency` didn't help_\n\nWe believe that we can use [Queue selector](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#queue-selector) to limit indexing jobs only to specific sidekiq nodes, which should reduce the number of indexing requests and hopefully solve or reduce the number of `429 (Too Many Requests)`.\n\n1. Pick one sidekiq node, which will be dedicated to indexing, and add these lines to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. This will configure 1 process dedicated for indexing.\n  ```ruby\n  sidekiq['enable'] = true\n  sidekiq['queue_selector'] = true\n  sidekiq['queue_groups'] = [\n    \"feature_category=global_search\"\n  ]\n  ```\n  \n2. Save the file and reconfigure GitLab for the changes to take effect:\n  ```shell\n  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure\n  ```\n3. Add these lines to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` on other non-indexing nodes. This will configure 1 process for non-indexing background jobs.\n  ```ruby\n  sidekiq['enable'] = true\n  sidekiq['queue_selector'] = true\n  sidekiq['queue_groups'] = [\n    \"feature_category!=global_search\"\n  ]\n  ```\n  \n4.

The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations.

Often times they are looking for the commit where this portion of the code was changed.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdapted from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327052:\n\nSince the Git Blame offers much of this information that a user would be looking for related to a specific section of code they are looking at, we should make it easier to get to that information. For the first iteration of this, we will include a link from the file line that takes the user directly to the Blame page (anchored to the specific line).\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/3b9e90c88ae8d47497f358f9345a4cf9/image.png)\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/d4b8eea861e9bf99aac940c66fdae87b/image.png)\n\n### Intended users\n\n[Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Metrics\n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature?

The main one is `\"archive\"`, and we have configuration options for it:\n\n```golang\n\tzipCacheExpiration = flag.Duration(\"zip-cache-expiration\", 60*time.Second, \"Zip serving archive cache expiration interval\")\n\tzipCacheCleanup    = flag.Duration(\"zip-cache-cleanup\", 30*time.Second, \"Zip serving archive cache cleanup interval\")\n\tzipCacheRefresh    = flag.Duration(\"zip-cache-refresh\", 30*time.Second, \"Zip serving archive cache refresh interval\")\n```\n\nThese options work like this:\n1. every `cacheClenup` interval we scan the cache and remove everything which was added to the cache longer than `cacheExpiration` interval\n1. every time we `hit` the cache if archive was added to the cache longer than `zipCacheRefresh` ago, we `update` it - basically make it look like it was just added to the cache\n\nso tradeoffs work like this:\n1. longer `zipCacheExpiration` - takes more memory, but increases the hit rate as we have more data in cache.\n1. longer `zipCacheCleanup` - saves CPU time, but increases memory consumption, as do garbage collection less often\n1. longer `zipCacheRefresh` - saves some CPU by doing fewer operations with memory, but makes cache less \"up to date\", as we can evict cache entries that were accessed recently. (TBH, I don't know why we can't just make this 0, I'm not sure how big CPU impact of this will)\n\nHowever, pages daemon already takes quite big amount of memory, up to 1.7 GB on gitlab.com. And 90% of this memory is used by zip archives cache. There is an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/-/issues/702) to optimize this. So if we want to include more data in this cache, we need to do that very carefully.\n\nI think default `30 sec` for `zipCacheCleanup` and `zipCacheRefresh` is OK.

Why are we doing this work\n\nWe are using the `Security::Finding` records to store some metadata of findings to improve the performance of the \"pipeline security tab\". \n\nRecords are being created

In 15.0, we have added two new keywords to execute tasks that require access to environment scope variables. You can now add `environment: action: access` in the .gitlab-ci.yaml file for a broad set of use cases and `environment: action: verify` when specifically needing to verify the results during a deployment.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nUsers need a way to add a post-deployment step in the CI/CD pipeline to check that the deployment was successful. This step may require access to environment scope. GitLab has existing keywords, such as `prepare` (that may already be used as a workaround) but we would like a different word to convey a different semantic.\n\n[Users also use `prepare` to in other case](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359214#note_925388958) (internal), e.g. for running migrations, or promoting environments.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a new `environment:action` ([docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#environmentaction)) job keywords called `verify` and `access`. For the MVC, these keywords behaves the same as `prepare` (does not count as a deployment and has access to the env-scoped variables).\n\n\n### Original proposal\n```\nenvironment:\n    action: verify\n```\n\nOR\n\n```\nenvironment:\n    action: check\n```\n\nFeature: Use already defined environment scoped variables to `check` or `verify` an environment endpoint to validate it's working ok, post deployment in a subsequent job.\n\nWhy: This allows for us to stop abusing `action: prepare` for what is technically not a \"prepare\" step. We’ve been using this so that we can access scoped variables without counting as a deployment.\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Consider adding related issues and epics to this issue.

I am inquiring further about the second instance where there are some non-zero values and will update this comment accordingly. \n\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe values within `.redis_hll_counters` are **0** in some GitLab environments. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nThe values within `.redis_hll_counters` should be populated properly. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\nCurrently if ServicePing is disabled, Redis metrics aren't being tracked (see https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7388#note_869539919).

This is why only Redis metrics are missing.\n\nWe plan to fix this behaviour in ~15.1 (related issue)[https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/product-intelligence/-/issues/526] and allow customers to enable all metrics to be collected while Service Ping is disabled.\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Notes\n\nThe gitlab-org/gitlab#330541 and gitlab-org/gitlab#321963  issues discuss removing some of the metrics in `.redis_hll_counters` but those issues capture **11** metrics total.

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe branch you're committing to in the pipeline editor is called \"target branch\".

This is more of a style preference, I just noticed since we were reassigning the value twice.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```js\n    \u003e const sourceBranch = targetBranch;\n    \u003e const params = openMergeRequest\n    \u003e   ? {\n    \u003e       type: COMMIT_SUCCESS_WITH_REDIRECT,\n    \u003e       params: {\n    \u003e         sourceBranch,\n    \u003e         targetBranch: this.currentBranch,\n    \u003e       },\n    \u003e     }\n    \u003e   : { type: COMMIT_SUCCESS };\n    \u003e ```\n\nThe source branch of the MR is the target branch of the commit, and the target branch of the MR is the current branch the user is on.

Some ideas:\n\u003e \n\u003e * Run the above queries as part of rake task, but taking into account the decomposed database\n\u003e * Run the above queries by cron, by doing a sampling/randomisation of a small subset of the `ci_namespace_mirrors` and by statistical significance over longer period we effectively check each record\n\u003e \n\u003e I think the most important is comparing the coherence between `traversal_ids`, less relevent if we have extra records present in `ci_namespace_mirrors` vs `namespaces`.

new user and sign in via SSO returns 404 error (Project and Group Invite)","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen a **new** user is invited via email to a group or project, if they accept the invite and sign in via SSO, after login, they will be redirected to 404 page not found `https://gitlab.com/groups/groupname/-/activity`\n\nBug is reported by [Premium customer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000ATRo6AAH) via [Internal Ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/252528). ([All GitLab team members can view](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/internal-support/#viewing-support-tickets))\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create new private group `example-group`\n1. Invite a user via email\n1. Click `Join Now` from the email\n1. Click Create Account using `Google` (or Sign in with any other SSO)\n   1. Accept Terms if needed\n1. Gets a 404 page `https://gitlab.com/groups/groupname/-/activity`\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/groups/te3054/-/group_members?tab=invited\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUser was presented with a 404 page after signing in via SSO (User does not have an account and logs in for the first time) The same applies to project invite. \n\nUpon checking the group/project permission, we noticed the email is still at `Invited` tab and the relevant permission was not applied to the new user correctly, hence the 404 page.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nCorrectly apply the permission to the user after account creation after SSO login, user should be able to view the group's activity page.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com (14.8.0-pre 3bf32596aaf), we also tested on `14.1.2` and `14.4.2`\n\n### Investigation Notes\n\n- We're unsure if this is a ~regression from this possible change: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56695\n- It seems like after the user creation, the token expires, and the group member permission is not applied to the new user.\n- If we invite the user again, it will work as their user is already created.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-28T12:11:10.019Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T12:01:57.204Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T19:03:48.220Z","closed_by":{"id":11997412,"username":"jessieay","name":"Jessie

We can more quickly iterate, release new features to customers, and then batch larger units of value into packages to push through the Slack Approval process for .com. On our end, we could also engage internal and Beta customers who are using Self-Managed GitLab and Slack to get rapid feedback and validation as we roll out updates.\n\nFor this Spike, we'd like to evaluate the approach and identify any blockers/challenges, and if possible, set up a process or framework for development moving forward. If the team prefers .com first based on this investigation, we'll just need to come back around to figure out how to roll updates from .com to Self-Managed at a later date.\n\n## Questions \n\n- What's the recommended approach? \n- What will allow us to iterate and provide value to customers most quickly?\n- What is the process/documentation for rolling out updates or getting started on a new Slack feature/update?\n- What is the process for bundling up features delivered through App Manifests to Self-managed customers into GitLab.com updates?\n\n## Resources\n\n- Review GitLab-specific [Slack App Update Guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXePct8JiG1qrLAgjWX3sy8Xoi8gMHlImDBFxJAcZfs/edit?usp=sharing) from Adam @ Slack regarding [App Manifests](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests)\n- General [Migration guide for classic Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/authentication/migration)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-27T21:21:30.934Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:01:49.693Z","closed_at":"2022-04-01T09:49:37.931Z","closed_by":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"labels":["Deliverable","Integration::Slack","auto updated","backend","devops::manage","group::integrations","section::dev","spike","support request","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"}],"author":{"id":10222550,"username":"g.hickman","name":"Grant Hickman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10222550/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/g.hickman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351384","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351384","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351384/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/351384/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#351384","relative":"#351384","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#351384"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6187,"epic":{"id":288974,"iid":6187,"title":"Spike: Rebuild/refactor the Slack Application","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6187","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101418060,"iid":351382,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix undefined this in `toMatchInterpolatedText` utility","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nWhen an assertion that uses `toMatchInterpolatedText` custom matcher fails, the resulting error message does not indicate why the test has failed. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important.
