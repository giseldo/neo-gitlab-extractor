[{"id":112796573,"iid":369874,"project_id":278964,"title":"Demote PG::ReadOnlySqlTransaction in gitlab:db:validate_config from ERROR to WARNING","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nIn GitLab 15.1.0 we [introduced additional handling](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364829) of an error when doing an upsert on a read-only database. When a user encounters this scenario, they are presented with a message stating \"ERROR: cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction\". The verbiage is confusing to users because it implies it is `ERROR` severity, but it should be a `WARNING` since this does not break anything or halt any processes.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWhen running the `gitlab:db:validate_config` migration on a read-only Geo secondary, the task appears to fail with the message\n\n```\nWARNING: Could not write to the database main: PG::ReadOnlySqlTransaction: ERROR:  cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction\n```\n\nThe verbiage is confusing here since the message is WARNING severity but includes an additional ERROR message that may confuse users. This behavior is actually expectd since a Geo secondary site will always be read-only, and will not allow an INSERT statement.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Ingrid (Infrastructure Operator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#ingrid-infrastructure-operator)\n* [Dakota (Application Development Director)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#dakota-application-development-director)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n\n--\u003e\n\nThis change primarily affects Sidney, who would be responsible for executing this task in a Geo environment. When presented with this message, they may be inclined to open a ticket with GitLab Support for assistance with resolving the issue. Since this is a warning and is expected behavior, we can deflect this interaction and preserve GitLab Support resources by adjusting the verbiage to be more clear.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nSidney should not be presented with a message that contains conflicting information. This may cause unnecessary confusion, leading them to believe that a database migration was unsuccessful and needs action.\n\nInstead, Sidney should feel confident that they understand the information presented to them is accurate and meaningful. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n\nIn order to solve this, we should do one of the following:\n\n1. Change the string \"ERROR\" to \"WARNING\"\n   ```\n   WARNING: Could not write to the database main: PG::ReadOnlySqlTransaction: WARNING:  cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction\n   ```\n1. Remove the second severity completely\n   ```\n   WARNING: Could not write to the database main: PG::ReadOnlySqlTransaction: cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction\n   ```\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nThis occurs most recently when upgrading from GitLab 15.1.2 to 15.2.x. If you wish to reproduce, perhaps the most obvious way is to perform a [zero downtime upgrade on Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/zero_downtime.html#geo-deployment).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members\n\nPlease consider performing a threat model for the code changes that are introduced as part of this feature. To get started, refer to our Threat Modeling handbook page https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/threat_modeling/#threat-modeling.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out to the Application Security Team (`@gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec`) to discuss any security concerns.\n--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\nOnce this is fixed, we should also add a description of the message and its impact in the [Geo troubleshooting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting.html) document.\n\n### Available Tier\n\n\u003c!-- This section should be used for setting the appropriate tier that this feature will belong to.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=dosuken-org group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission 25 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission 50 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission 75 --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission` feature flag.

When status checks are not passing **and** they are required to, then update the status checks widget description to include the following `merge request is blocked until all status checks have passed`. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369861#note_1145168540 for desgins.\n1. See if ~documentation needs to be updated.\n1.

Add a ~\"feature flag\" if one has not already been added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369859.\n1. Add a new merge request state for status checks.\n   * Note: See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58658 as an example.\n   * Note: Status check results are currently fetched async in the [widget extension](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/extensions/status_checks/index.js#L88). Ideally we can share the response with the MR state, and thus only request the data once.\n   * Note: We'll also need to set the `checking` status and display the `MRWidgetChecking` widget while the status check results are busy fetching.\n1.

API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#get-a-member-of-a-group-or-project-including-inherited-and-invited-members) fails to return the highest `access_level` if multiple memberships exist for a user.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe following example illustrates the case:\nGroup: [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/opstrace/-/group_members?search=mappelman](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace) (groupID: 14485840)\nUser: Me (userID: :10378667)\n\n`curl --header “PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003ctoken\u003e” “https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/14485840/members/all/10378667”`\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 10378667,\n  \"username\": \"mappelman\",\n  \"name\": \"Mat Appelman\",\n  \"state\": \"active\",\n  \"avatar_url\": \"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10378667/avatar.png\",\n  \"web_url\": \"https://gitlab.com/mappelman\",\n  \"access_level\": 30,\n

null,\n  \"membership_state\": \"active\"\n}\n```\naccess_level = 30\n\n`curl --header “PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003ctoken\u003e” “https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/14485840/members/10378667”`\n\n```\n{\n

\"https://gitlab.com/nicholasklick\"\n  },\n  \"expires_at\": null,\n  \"membership_state\": \"active\"\n}\n```\naccess_level = 50\n\nWhen I visit [the membership tab for the group](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/opstrace/-/group_members?search=mappelman) I also see the following two entries:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-08-03_at_6.13.52_PM](/uploads/b68953b3a7a59f617116aea7dae4b7d8/Screen_Shot_2022-08-03_at_6.13.52_PM.png)\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nInherited group membership API does not return highest `access_level` in above repro.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nInherited group membership API should return highest `access_level` of all inherited AND direct membership entries. It appears that it is only returning the inherited `access_level`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI'm a total newb to the GitLab codebase so forgive me if I've missed something as I'm tracking the code paths here, but in the [`members.rb` file the following members object](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/bc1a15029433bb87b0d81a3917781f4cb9129b57/lib/api/members.rb#L94-95):\n\n```\nmembers = find_all_members(source)\nmember = members.find_by!(user_id: params[:user_id])\n```\n\nis the result of what I presume is this SQL execution:\n\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT ON (user_id, invite_email) *\nORDER BY user_id, invite_email, access_level DESC, expires_at DESC, created_at ASC\nWHERE source_id in (\u003call the IDs of the groups in the inheritance chain\u003e)\n```\n\nWith DISTINCT ON, You tell PostgreSQL to return a single row for each distinct group defined by the ON clause. Which row in that group is returned is specified with the ORDER BY clause. That is to say, the `members = find_all_members(source)` array from above could have multiple entries for the same `user_id` if there are multiple `(user_id, invite_email)` combinations. The selected `member = members.find_by!(user_id: params[:user_id])` would simply find the first match when in fact there could be multiple matches with varying `access_levels`.\n\nI presume that this is why two membership entries [show in the members table for myself](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/opstrace/-/group_members?search=mappelman)\n\nCan we drop the `invite_email` in `SELECT DISTINCT ON (user_id, invite_email)`? This would ensure only a single user membership was returned.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-04T01:52:13.020Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T10:44:14.934Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T10:19:21.412Z","closed_by":{"id":11485419,"username":"lohrc","name":"Christina Lohr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11485419/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lohrc"},"labels":["devops::manage","group::organization","section::dev","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":10378667,"username":"mappelman","name":"Mat Appelman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10378667/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mappelman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369592","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369592","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369592/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369592/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#369592","relative":"#369592","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#369592"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8747,"epic":{"id":602372,"iid":8747,"title":"Problems with member inheritance","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8747","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112758772,"iid":369591,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create GraphQL API to query suggested reviewers","description":"## 🧩 Problems to solve\n\nWe want to display suggested reviewers as a [dropdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353087) on the code review sidebar.

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\nThis is the first step of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8514: Indexing labels of issues for Advanced Search.\n\n### Details\n\nWe're going to index labels for issues, which would allow us to efficiently aggregate them and improve Advanced Search facets.\n\nHere's the technical plan we have right now:\n\n1. Index label_ids as an array of keywords `[\"123\", \"124\", \"201\"]`\n2. Use aggregations to load label_ids sorted by popularity for the issue results. We need to determine the size (limit) for that\n3. Load labels from the database `where(id: label_ids)` to get meta fields like color and group/project ids\n4. Filter (search) labels on the frontend side\n\nThis is essentially the original option 2, but with a faster iteration (using database with a limited number of ids). Also, this would allow us to update the labels field in the index only when labels are removed or added. As our next iteration we might want to consider creating a separate Elasticsearch index for labels and using it instead of the database.\n\nI think with a reasonable limit (maybe 100-300?) it should be quite fast for the database and the frontend filtering.\n\n\u003c!--\n\nI believe we have 2 options:\n\n1. Index labels as an array for each document with additional data embedded into the string (`10:123#851220:frontend` for example)\n2. Index labels as an array of ids and load the data from the database or from a new labels index in Elasticsearch\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eReproducible example for keyword

information needed in index\n* do not want to store description (too big)\n* how to handle global searches when many labels are potentially returned \n  * return top X labels (100? 50?)\n* how to propagate label title or color change if stored in an array with those fields\n  * update by query is an option \n  * reindexing all issues with the labels is another option\n\n\n### Future iteration\n\n- Use a separate labels index for global searches\n- Use update_by_query for updated labels if reindexing is not performant enough\n- Adding the 3rd queue (`operational`) for updating labels for existing documents","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-03T12:00:02.752Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T18:47:53.851Z","closed_at":"2022-09-12T12:30:54.114Z","closed_by":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `group_level_scan_result_policies` feature flag.

Therefore, as you can see in this example https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92690, for each event I added:\n\n1. Event definition\n2. Code to publish the event \n3. Test for the event definition\n4. Test for the event being published\n\nThis issue is to discuss if the `3. Test for the event definition` is really necessary.\n\n### How the test is done\n\nAs an example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/events/projects/project_path_changed_event_spec.rb\n\nFor each event definition we use one (or a few) valid events and a few of invalid events to test if this list of events matches with the valid/invalid status. \n\nTo validate an event we test it against its schema, if it raises `Gitlab::EventStore::InvalidEvent`, the event is invalid, otherwise it's valid.\n\n### Why I think we don't need these tests\n\n(**pros**) The advantage, as far as I can see, to adding these tests is to have a list of examples of events. But since the schemas already describes the events, I think it's quite straightforward to envision valid and invalid events.\n\n(**cons**) I don't think this aggregates value because:\n\n- As far as I understand, these tests are validating that the JSON scheme library is working as expected, I think we should _trust_ it works;\n- These tests are getting more and more complex, by trying to add more examples of invalid jsons (example of conversation around that: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92690#note_1046808685);\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove these specs to win a little time on the CI and reduce complexity in MR code reviews.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-02T10:42:24.143Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T14:32:00.717Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T10:00:52.938Z","closed_by":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio

Fix GDK's runner configuration when using HTTPS and Docker\n\nCurrently, GDK configures a Docker runner incorrectly when using HTTPS. Two changes need to be made:\n\n1. The SSL certificate needs to be mounted to the Docker container when the runner is started\n2. `tls-ca-file` should _not_ be set in `gitlab-runner-config.toml` when using a Docker runner\n\n### 2. Add a Vault service to GDK.\n\nThis service will be off by default. It can be enabled with:\n\n```yaml\n# gdk.yml\n\nvault:\n  enabled: true\n  listen_address: 127.0.0.1 # optional, defaults to the top level `listen_address`\n```\n\n`gdk start vault` will start a Vault dev server with the given listen address\n\nIdeally, this work should also:\n\n* Export a `VAULT_ADDR` variable so developers can configure Vault on the command line (only when Vault is enabled)\n* Ensure that `Gitlab.settings.ci_jwt_signing_key` is never `nil` in local environments\n* Install Vault with Homebrew (only when Vault is enabled)\n\n### 3. Add helpers to configure Vault.\n\nThe Vault server needs to be configured with an auth policy and role and should have some seed data. The policy and seed data can be configured when the Vault server is started, but the role is project specific. Examples of the configuration can be seen in https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2380296\n\n1. Seeding data\n\n    ```\n    vault secrets enable -path=kv-v2 kv-v2\n\n    vault kv put kv-v2/gitlab-test/db password=db-password-goes-here\n    vault kv put kv-v2/gitlab-test/db other_secret=more-secret-value\n    ```\n2. Seeding auth policy\n        \n    ```\n    vault auth enable -path=gitlab jwt\n\n    vault write auth/gitlab/config \\\n      jwks_url=\"https://`gdk.hostname`:`gdk.port`/-/jwks\" \\\n      bound_issuer=\"https://`gdk.hostname`:`gdk.port`\"\n    ```\n\n3. Seeding auth role\n\n    ```\n    vault write auth/gitlab/role/gitlab-test-role - \u003c\u003cEOF\n    {\n      \"role_type\": \"jwt\",\n      \"policies\": [\"gitlab-test-policy\"],\n      \"token_explicit_max_ttl\": 600,\n      \"user_claim\": \"user_email\",\n      \"bound_claims\": {\n        \"project_id\": \"\u003cproject_id\u003e\"\n       },\n       \"bound_audiences\": \"https://`gdk.hostname`:`gdk.port`\"\n     }\n     EOF\n     ```\n\n    This either needs to be run manually, or we could add a `rake` helper, or we can find a way to configure it for every project in the GDK\n\n## Implementation Table\n\n| Title | MR Link | Done? |\n| ------ | ------ | ----- |\n| Fix GDK's runner configuration when using HTTPS and Docker | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests/2714 | :white_check_mark: |\n| Add a Vault service to GDK | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests/2735 | :white_check_mark: |\n| Add helpers to configure Vault | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests/2766 | :white_check_mark: |","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-01T13:36:00.231Z","updated_at":"2022-11-26T00:03:44.198Z","closed_at":"2022-11-23T12:57:33.116Z","closed_by":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"labels":["Category:Secrets Management","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","maintenance::workflow","missed:15.6","section::ops","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"}],"author":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369351","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369351","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369351/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369351/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#369351","relative":"#369351","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#369351"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112602001,"iid":369345,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add a meaningful audit event name for `max_file_size` in Group Push Rules","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nSome audit events are named `audit_operation`.
