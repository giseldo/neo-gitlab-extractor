This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nThis is a pre-requisite for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17176\n\nCurrently, we do not log any attempts to create a personal access token. Since [we need to add an ability for the admin user to create personal access tokens for other users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17176), we would like track any successful or failed attempts. See [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17176#note_432234432) for related conversation.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd logging to `PersonalAccessTokens::CreateService` and `PersonalAccessTokens::RevokeService`. Since audit event logs is an Enterprise feature, also create application logs.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature?

Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com display_merge_conflicts_in_diff true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_create_code-review`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff 25 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff 50 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff 75 --actors`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff 100 --actors`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `display_merge_conflicts_in_diff`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `display_merge_conflicts_in_diff` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete display_merge_conflicts_in_diff --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set display_merge_conflicts_in_diff false\n```\n\n### Testing\nIntegration test or E2E test to be added to view conflict on Changes tab.

You may have run into a problem with publishing the same version multiple times. For Java packages, you expect to be able to publish duplicate snapshots, but not releases. \n\nWe've addressed this issue by adding a new group setting for the package registry that allows you to choose whether or not you'd like to allow or disallow duplicate Maven or Gradle uploads. By default, duplicates will not be allowed with the exception of snapshots. You can easily adjust this by navigating to your group-\u003esettings-\u003epackages \u0026 registries and enable duplicates or add an exception using regular expression.\n\nAfter Maven and Gradle, we'll be doing the same for other package manager formats as well. We'll follow the standard set by the public registries. \n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWhen using the GitLab Package Registry to upload packages, a user can upload the same Maven package name/version multiple times. The newest record will always be served when installing. The older records will only be accessible via the UI or API. This can result in the wrong dependency being installed and can introduce risk into the software development lifecycle.\n\n### Proposal\n\nOffer a setting that will allow Admin to determine if they want to allow or disallow duplicate Maven packages to be published to their registry. By default, duplicate Maven uploads will be allowed. In addition, allow an Admin to add any additional exceptions using regex. \n\nThis table is a good reference for our current duplicate behavior, and it can be used to determine what the default value should be as we work through adding this setting for each package type.\n| Package type | Duplicates allowed? |\n|--------------|---------------------|\n| npm   | ‚ùå |\n| maven | ‚úÖ |\n| NuGet | ‚úÖ |\n| Conan | ‚úÖ |\n| PyPI  | ‚ùå |\n\n#### A word on Snapshots\n\nA snapshot version in Maven is one that has not been released.\n\nThe idea is that before a 1.0 release (or any other release) is done, there exists a 1.0-SNAPSHOT. That version is what might become 1.0. It's basically \"1.0 under development\". This might be close to a real 1.0 release, or pretty far (right after the 0.9 release, for example).\n\nThe difference between a \"real\" version and a snapshot version is that snapshots might get updates. That means that downloading 1.0-SNAPSHOT today might give a different file than downloading it yesterday or tomorrow.\n\nUsually, snapshot dependencies should only exist during development and no released version (i.e. no non-snapshot) should have a dependency on a snapshot version.\n\n##### How to exclude SNAPSHOTS\n\nFor Maven SNAPSHOT artifacts the regular version is `0.9.3-SNAPSHOT`. This is what is published  to the repo by Maven or Gradle, however, the artifacts are stored in the repository (and physically served later on) are named:\n\n\u003e foo-bar-0.9.3-20201027.142837-1.jar\n\nand for another build:\n\n\u003e foo-bar-0.9.3-20201028.193111-1.jar\n\nIn other words, there is now SNAPSHOT keyword included. For example, check out this [SNAPSHOT repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/spockframework/spock-core/2.0-groovy-3.0-SNAPSHOT/) hosted by Sonatype Nexus. \n\nTherefore, the exclusion rule has to operate on the logical name to make it work as expected.\n\n\n#### Questions\n- :white_check_mark: Should this setting be at the instance/group/project level? Can it be set at the instance level as a default and then inherited (but adjustable) at the group level?\n  - We've decided to implement this at the group level to start.\n- :white_check_mark: [About 10% of Maven packages on GitLab.com are duplicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217141#note_418763815) How will this setting impact those users? The same goes for GitLab Self-Managed instances.\n  - This will not be a breaking change.\n- What about Gradle? Do we need a separate issue/design/implementation?\n  - No, although the artifact (file) itself has a different name, in the database, we only store the common name and version.\n\n### Links\n- [What

`:dependency_proxy_for_private_groups` feature flag. \n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::package\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#s_package`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @sabrams \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect the dependency proxy to work for public and private groups, with public group users now requiring authentication to use the dependency proxy.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nWe added the feature flag because https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46042 caused a change in the behavior of how public groups are able to use the dependency proxy. Previously users could use the dependency proxy without authentication, but with !46042, users now need to authenticate. \n\nThis means this may be a breaking change for users of the dependency proxy. If they have a pipeline that uses it, for example, they will receive an `unauthorized` error and will need to update their CI to log in.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- [Kibana chart showing requests to the applicable controller](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/d091d9ac0785b96a69a2b07bdc069f7b)\n  - Watch the `json.status` aggregation for errors. 200, 302, and 401 are expected. The 401 is part of the authentication workflow (the 401 returns a header that instructs the docker client to request an access token). \n  - 403 errors tell us that users are trying to access the Dependency Proxy without proper credentials, these are the errors that show users that may be running into problems. \n\n### Documentation for helping anyone surprised/affected by this change\n\n- Users will need to authenticate with the Dependency Proxy in order to continue using it. Please see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#authenticate-with-the-dependency-proxy for details on how to authenticate, and how to update CI scripts that may use the Dependency Proxy.\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nN/A, this is scoped to the instance and could not be scoped to groups or projects.\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set dependency_proxy_for_private_groups true --staging`)\n- [x] Test feature on staging\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [-] Enable on GitLab.com and verify behaviour  (`/chatops run feature set dependency_proxy_for_private_groups true`)\n- [x] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set dependency_proxy_for_private_groups true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Enable feature flag by default in 13.7 and add changelog entry\n- [ ] Remove feature flag in 13.9\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set dependency_proxy_for_private_groups false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-04T22:51:45.765Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T18:04:39.050Z","closed_at":"2022-05-09T20:47:18.550Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nThe previous release introduced a project setting to disable keeping the latest artifact from the most recent successful job.

Consequently, self-managed instances are unable to opt out of a feature that can result in storing unnecessary data and ultimately increasing storage consumption.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nAdd admin setting to disable keeping latest artifact at the instance-level.

Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit test changes - required, please add tests for all new implemented logics\n* Integration test changes - required, please add test for UI element rendering, when selected and when unselected.\n\n\n\u003c!-- Consider adding related issues and epics to this issue.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nInclude is one of the most popular keywords to use when writing a full CI/CD pipeline, if you are are building GitLab pipelines, you are probably using the include keyword in your pipeline configuration, as it allows you to bring external YAML configuration into your CI/CD pipeline, include is also using in Parent child and multi project pipeline, in this release we are allowing you to conditional your includes, so in a single pipeline you can decide when should or shouldn't include external CI/CD configuration, this will make your pipeline more dynamic\n\n\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs an engineer who builds CI/CD pipelines, I want to conditionally include job definitions so that I can build a more consistent and extendable library of CI jobs that can be shared across projects.\n\nCurrently, it's not possible to conditionally include jobs in CI/CD pipelines, which users may want to do in the event they have a library of shared job definitions. One of the biggest hurdles to this is YAML namespace collisions, which we currently address via [parent/child pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html). While this solution, particularly dynamic child pipelines, does work, it's still difficult to implement a number of shared job definitions from a single source (i.e. one project that's used as a CI \"library\") across multiple projects.\n\nI'm creating this on behalf of a customer, who I think raised some really good points in their ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/177222 (ZD internal only)\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe workflow to address is reusing jobs across multiple pipelines. The goal is to prevent namespace collisions by including those jobs only under certain circumstances rather than generating the job conditionally. It's a quality of life improvement - the current method isn't necessarily broken, but it introduces a lot of extra moving parts. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThe proposed syntax would look like this:\n\n```\n# file: /templates/common.gitlab-ci.yml\nvariables:\n  __TEMPLATES_COMMON_YML__: true\n\n\n# file: /templates/docker/build.gitlab-ci.yml\"\ninclude:\n  - local: \"/templates/common.gitlab-ci.yml\"\n    rules:\n      - if: $__TEMPLATES_COMMON_YML__\n        when: never\n```\n\nThis uses the familiar `rules` syntax along with `include`, which is readable and concise. As far as implementation, we already do something similar with `workflow`. The conditions here would be evaluated as part of the merging of the YAML, and the defined template would only be merged into the pipeline for processing if the rules evaluate to true.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThis would not impact permissions or security as far as I can tell.

working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46483 me and @minac noticed that this particular service is very hard to reason about and a simple change such as calculating UUIDv5 instead of UUIDv4 (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43881) didn't work at first (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212322#note_434346683) and required additional investigation (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/45899) and was finally fixed with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46483.\n\nWe should refine this issue in order to come up with a rough plan on how to simplify this or break it up in smaller parts so it's easier to reason about.\n\n## StoreReportService Responsibilities\n\n- Store finding\n- Store vulnerability\n- Update update_vulnerability_scanners\n- Reset remediations\n- Update finding_signatures\n- Update vulnerability_identifier\n- Update vulnerability_links\n- Associate findings with pipelines\n- Update \"resolved on default branch\"\n\nAs we can see above, this service class has so many responsibilities.\n\n## Known issues\n\nWe should address all the issues listed below;\n\n- [ ] Not transactional \n  - [ ] If an error happens, an uncomplete finding will be created\n  - [ ] If an error happens the job terminates and does not save the rest of the findings\n- [ ] If an error happens, there is no indication to the end-user\n- [ ] Has performance issues\n- [ ] Dry-run option is not available\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] ~backend Fix the known issues aforementioned by following;\n  - [x] The improvements should be under a feature flag to control the risk of introducing a regression\n  - [x] Responsibilities should be set clearly and handled by different modules/classes\n  - [ ] Implementation should be robust which means, does not propagate the exception to the caller\n  - [x] Any kind of exception has to be logged\n  - [ ] We should put meaningful log messages for each operation to debug the system easily\n  - [x] Any error that happened during the ingestion process should be added to the related `Security::Scan` record\n  - [x] The `StoreReportService` should run after we ingest the findings for the pipeline because the validation runs on this process and we shouldn't try ingesting the invalid reports.\n  - [ ] Model layer validations should be applied\n  - [ ] We should also update the vulnerability statistics after ingestion(branch: update_vulnerability_statistics_after_ingestion)\n\n## Pseudo implementation\n\n```ruby\nclass StoreReportService_V2\n  BATCH_SIZE = 1_000\n\n  def initialize(pipeline, report)\n    @pipeline = pipeline\n    @report = report\n  end\n\n  def execute\n    update_scanners\n    update_findings\n    update_resolved_findings\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def update_scanners\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  def update_findings\n    @vuln_ids ||= report.findings.each_slice(BATCH_SIZE).map do |batch|\n      FindingsProcessor.process(batch) # This must be transactional\n    end\n  end\n\n  def update_resolved_findings\n    # mark vulnerabilities as resolved where id != vuln_ids\n  end\nend\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-04T15:40:04.844Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T15:21:03.706Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T02:27:54.532Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago

However, without the timestamp and the success/error status of the last cleanup policy execution, we have no programmatic way to tell whether a given repository has been successfully cleaned or not.\n\nHaving the execution timestamp and status of the last cleanup policy run will also be useful for general debug purposes.\n\n## Proposal\n\nUse the `Packages::Event` model to capture the timestamp of when a cleanup policy is started, completed, stopped or unfinished. \n\nIntroduce 3 events for the `Packages::Event` model for cleanup status: (These attributes should be updated every time a cleanup policy is executed.)\n\n* cleanup started\n* cleanup done\n* cleanup stopped or unfinished\n\nFor the container registry, is thus than a matter of select container repositories that have an event like `cleanup done` associated with them.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-04T13:59:18.777Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T08:44:32.877Z","closed_at":"2020-12-16T09:29:51.882Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","package:active","quad-planning::complete-no-action","ruby","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"Jo√£o Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276479","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/276479","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/276479/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/276479/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#276479","relative":"#276479","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#276479"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73859999,"iid":276476,"project_id":278964,"title":"Rename project's policy `feature_available?` helper method","description":"In app/policies/project_policy.rb we define a helper method `feature_available?` which checks if a project feature is enabled for the project (e.g. if the project has issues enabled publicly or for members only).

PostgreSQL","description":"## Important: This issue is blocked\n\nThis issue is blocked by https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8419. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365575#note_1029724463 for more information.\n\n## Problem\n\nOriginally proposed by @ayufan .\n\nIn [GitLab Feature Flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html), Feature Flag Client requests to Feature Flag Server repeatedly at the fixed interval (i.e. polling), and every request requires the server to generate a feature flag payload, which executes a database query to fetch data from PostgreSQL. This process works OK, however, there is more room to optimize the server-side logic.\n\n## Monitoring\n\n- [Grafana](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/api-rails-controller/api-rails-controller?orgId=1\u0026var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-controller=Grape\u0026var-action=GET%20%2Fapi%2Ffeature_flags%2Funleash%2F:project_id%2Fclient%2Ffeatures)\n- [Kibana (p99)](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/27bc2640-e85c-11ec-b86b-d963a1a6788e)\n- [Kibana (Average)](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/efd42e50-e79b-11ec-8656-f5f2137823ba)\n- [Kibana log](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/02c8bd60-e79b-11ec-8656-f5f2137823ba)\n\n## Proposal\n\nGiven feature flag data is not frequently changed (e.g. 10 times per day), we can store the generated payload into Redis and serve the cached data without touching PostgreSQL at all.\n\nSpecifically, it works as:\n\n- When Feature Flag Client requests to Feature Flag Server, the server generates feature flag response by fetching data from PostgreSQL.\n- When a server generated a feature flag response, it stores exactly the same data into Redis with an unique key (e.g. project-id, client-id and environment-name combination)\n- When a client requests to the server again and the cache is found, the server returns the cached data.\n- When one of the feature flags, strategies or scopes is changed, the corresponding cache is invalided.\n\nThe expectations are:\n\n- The timing on the server-side API will be shorter. i.e. PostgreSQL vs Redis I/O.\n- The server-side API will be stable even if the [database query becomes more expensive](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276252#note_441353539).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-04T07:35:29.636Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T04:35:12.211Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T04:35:12.190Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Feature Flags","Error Budget Improvement","Release::P3","devops::release","group::release","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

@ankelly:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nPermission model around file locking is as follows:  \n\u0026gt; Locks can be created by any person who has at least Developer permissions to the repository.  \nOnly the user who locked the file or directory can edit locked files.\n\nBut what if user who locked the file removed from the project?  \n\nCurrently user who got removed from the  project can\u0026#39;t unlock file from  file page `https://gitlab.com/\u0026lt;owner\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;project\u0026gt;/-/blob/master/\u0026lt;file\u0026gt;` and get an error

We don\u0026#39;t get any error.\n\n![lk2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1ac2d150-1bd8-4119-85db-0ee1877d2da1/lk2.png)\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n* Create a public test project and a file named `test_file`  \n* Invite a test user say `Vicky` with developer permissions  \n* `Vicky` locked `test_file`  \n* As owner of the project, remove the `Vicky` user from the project  \n* At this point `Vicky` can\u0026#39;t unlocked file because he is not the member of the project and if he try to remove it by going over `test_file`, he\u0026#39;ll get an error.  \n* `Vicky` go over project `path_locks` ie  `https://gitlab.com/\u0026lt;owner\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;project\u0026gt;/path_locks`  \n* Remove the lock by selecting `Unlock`\n\nHere, the locked file has been removed by an unauthorized user\n\n\n#####  Impact\n\nUnauthorized user is able to unlock the locked file of the project\n\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUser who is removed from the project still able to unlock files. Even though this  is not possible from going over file location but going over project `path_locks`, malicious user is able to unlock the file\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUser who locked file shouldn\u0026#39;t be allowed to unlock files if he/she not anymore member of the project and has been removed by the admin\n\n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\n:This bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nUnauthorized user is able to unlock the locked file of the project\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [lk1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/754c80e1-1619-4a04-8250-32b3c8650800/lk1.png)\n* [lk2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1ac2d150-1bd8-4119-85db-0ee1877d2da1/lk2.png)vops","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-02T20:08:50.652Z","updated_at":"2022-01-30T05:55:56.478Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T12:07:06.701Z","closed_by":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Engineering Allocation","HackerOne","SaaS","Weakness::CWE-840","backend","devops::create","group::source code","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276067","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/276067","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/276067/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/276067/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#276067","relative":"#276067","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#276067"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7128,"epic":{"id":384256,"iid":7128,"title":"Security Engineering Allocation (Source Code BE): 10-NOV-2021","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7128","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73750642,"iid":276022,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"danger: Allow section prefix in commit messages\"","description":"The following discussion from !46474 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @caalberts started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46474#note_438723591):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e I'm not very clear if this line is supposed to fail because:\n    \u003e 1. it has capitalized `API:`, _or_\n    \u003e 1. it has lower case `a commit message`\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Maybe we could include tests for each:\n    \u003e -

Today users get 2 separate emails. One asks them to verify their email and the other lets them know that they were added to a group. We should combine these into one that explains that their account was provisioned for them and what the intended use of the account is.\n\nTitle\n```\nWelcome to GitLab\n```\n\nBody\n\nAn Enterprise User GitLab account has been created for you by your organization:\n\nUsername: \u003cusername\u003e\nEmail: \u003cemail\u003e\nGitLab group: \u003cgroup name\u003e\n\nBy authenticating with an account tied to an Enterprise e-mail address, it is understood that this account is an\nEnterprise User.

This reset is performed on every namespace and project on Gitlab.com which is [a heavy procedure to run](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/260286) given our ever increasing number of namespaces and projects. \n\n## Objective\n\nHow can we reset the monthly usage without running a forceful reset across all Gitlab.com namespaces and projects?\n\nGiven that we are going to [track monthly CI minutes usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246844), could we leverage this monthly accumulation of minutes to show and enforce the current month usage?\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nIdeally we should move away from using `namespace_statistics.shared_runners_seconds` to store the current usage because this requires a reset every month. If we move to a monthly usage tracking then we could eventually retire `namespece_statistics.shared_runners_seconds` and use a more dynamic approach:\n\n1. To accumulate the minutes used we can upsert (insert or update) a record for the current month. If no minutes used for a while we may show that for a namespace there is no record for the latest month, which means no minutes used.\n1. To display the quota used we would look for the record associated to the current month. If exists we show the data, otherwise we show 0 usage\n1. To enforce minutes used we would need to modify how `Ci::RegisterJobService` excludes jobs from projects with exhausted quota, to look at the data from the current month\n\nAdditional minutes should also be tracked monthly. When we create the record for the new month we would need to recalculate available additional minutes considering the past month usage.\n\nThis may allow us to effectively remove the need to reset minutes. It could also have the advantage that the tracking of the quota would be more accurate. E.g. not having minutes from February being added to minutes from January because the reset didn't work properly or was too slow.\n\n## Possible iteration plan\n\n1. Introduce `ci_project_monthly_usage` and `ci_namespace_monthly_usage` tables/models and track monthly minutes in there when a build finishes - this can be done in the background for the first month given that the usage would be partial. On the 1st of the month after this is deployed, statistics should match those in `project_statistics.shared_runners_seconds` and `namespace_statistics.shared_runners_seconds`. At this point we will have ways side-by-side to track CI minutes usage but only the old way is being enforced.\n1. When customer purchases additional minutes we should add the purchased ones to the current month record in `ci_namespace_monthly_usage` (side-by-side with the existing `namespaces.extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit`). When a new monthly record is created automatically (on the 1st of the month) we should [recalculate the remaining purchased minutes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acce00c339db23545302752c662a9cfaad5a2371/ee/app/services/ci/minutes/batch_reset_service.rb#L65) based on the previous month usage.\n1. We could turn the CI usage visualization to use the data from the current month rather than `namespace_statistics.shared_runners_seconds`. At this point we would still use data from `namespace_statistics.shared_runners_seconds` to [enforce the CI usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acce00c339db23545302752c662a9cfaad5a2371/ee/app/services/ee/ci/register_job_service.rb#L36) when jobs get assigned to a Shared Runner. -- Need to coordinate with ~\"section::growth\" or ~\"section::fulfillment\"\n1. Change `EE::Ci::RegisterJobService` to [enforce the CI usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/acce00c339db23545302752c662a9cfaad5a2371/ee/app/services/ee/ci/register_job_service.rb#L36) based on the monthly usage.\n1. Remove feature flags related to these changes\n1. Remove `ClearSharedRunnersMinutesWorker` and related workers/services\n1. Remove legacy data related to CI minutes (in `namespaces`, `projects`, `namespace_statistics` and `project_statistics`)\n\nNotes:\n\n* after (1) we should be able to get ~frontend to work on how to display this monthly usage https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/246844\n\nFurther analysis needed:\n\n* `last_ci_minutes_notification_at` and `last_ci_minutes_usage_notification_level` in `namespaces` table are used to send notifications to the customer when the remaining CI usage quota goes below a certain threshold. These values are also reset monthly today by `ClearSharedRunnersMinutesWorker`, so we would also need to automatically rotate those by storing them in `ci_namespace_monthly_usage` as `last_notification_at` and `last_notification_level`.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `scan_execution_policy_ui` feature flag.

changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature
