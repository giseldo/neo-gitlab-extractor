More can be read about the extensive process here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225529#current-process\n\nWe need a way to create a generic and scalable way to add new data types to the Geo Node Status Bars via Geo Self Service.\n\nThis proposal introduces the idea of re-working our the way the ~frontend generates the list of Status bars by receiving a generated list from the ~backend via the `index.haml.html` file\n\nThen looping through the list and extracting the counts from the API based on the keys provided from the index file.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Add method to `geo_helper.rb` to build an array of replicable types\u003cbr /\u003e\n1a. To do this we will first need to hard-code all the **non-SSF** types\u003cbr /\u003e\n1b. Then we will loop through `replicator_classes` from `geo.rb` to get all the **SSF** data types\u003cbr /\u003e\n1c. The end result should look like:\n```\nreplicable_types = [\n  {\n    plural_name: 'package_files',\n    plural_title: 'Package files'\n  },\n  {\n    plural_name: 'attachments',\n    plural_title: 'Attachments'\n  },\n  ...\n],\n```\n\nThis will then unblock https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228722 and allow it to be worked","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-13T19:02:03.578Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T18:39:14.639Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T19:01:56.648Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","api","backend","devops::systems","group::geo","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"}],"author":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4748809,"username":"zcuddy","name":"Zack Cuddy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4748809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zcuddy"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228700","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/228700","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/228700/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/228700/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#228700","relative":"#228700","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#228700"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2525,"epic":{"id":18585,"iid":2525,"title":"Geo: Implement frontend for Self-Service Framework replicables","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2525","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":55837845,"iid":228699,"project_id":278964,"title":"Solicit feedback from user directly in UI: dependency and license compliance pages","description":"~UX issue at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218369\n\n### Problem\n* Display prompt for feedback on the dependency list and/or license compliance page.

updated_at","description":"### Summary\n\nI just tried this search https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026snippets=false\u0026scope=issues\u0026repository_ref=master\u0026search=elasticsearch+AND+storage\u0026group_id=9970\u0026project_id=278964 . I'm trying to find an issue where I did an analysis of elasticsearch storage used. I tried a bunch of combinations of those words and didn't find it. I found it in my inbox and it is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195764 . It doesn't appear on the first page of results. But the first result for me is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21191 which does not seem to actually mention elasticsearch or storage and I'm not sure why it's there at all. I'm going to look further into this to understand why our relevance is behaving so strange here but it may be due to a bad sort order or something else. Weirdly I feel that this is just happening to me today and actually I've had great success with issue search over the last few weeks. I can't think of anything that's changed recently related to this either.\n\nOur query has this for sorting:\n```json\n  \"sort\": [\n    {\n      \"updated_at\": {\n        \"order\": \"desc\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"_score\"\n  ],\n```\n\nThis is actually a major cause of the problems as it's saying the updated_at date is more important than the _score. If I remove that from the sort I actually get my issue first up. I can't imagine this was added recently though...\n\nWe can combine the recency of the document with score for relevance but this is not the way to do it because it means the score/relevance of the document isn't even being considered unless the updated_at is equal (which it basically never will be since it's a timestamp)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)\n\n### Example Project\n\n(If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic behavior, and link to it here in the bug report)\n\n(If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n(What actually happens)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n(What you should see instead)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs -

The dependencies being scanned shouldn't be the ones installed when running `npm install --production` or `npm ci --production`.\n\nFor instance, in a project having the following `package.json` dependency file, `my_test_framework` and `another_dev_dep` shouldn't be scanned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"my_dep\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"another_dep\": \"~2.2.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\" : {\n    \"my_test_framework\": \"^3.1.0\".\n    \"another_dev_dep\": \"1.0.0 - 1.2.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nIntroduce a new CI variable named `DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES`. When it's `\"false\"`, the Dependency Scanning job ignores development dependencies when scanning npm projects.\n\n`DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` is false by default to ensure backward compatibility. The behavior doesn't change.\n\n### Further details\n\nTechnically, we can leverage the `dev` field of the dependencies listed in npm lock files. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.35.0/scanner/parser/npm/fixtures/simple/package-lock.json#L11\n\n- [`parser.ParseFunc`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.35.0/scanner/parser/parser.go#L11) is changed to accept parsing options of type `parser.Options`. `Options.IncludeDev` (bool) is set to make the parser ignore dev dependencies.\n- [`npm.Parse`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.35.0/scanner/parser/npm/lockfile.go#L17) is changed to capture the `dev` field. If `parser.Options.IncludeDev` is `false`, then it skips dependencies where `dev` is `true`. If a dependency is `dev` and non-dev, then it should not be skipped.\n- [`scanner.Scanner`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.35.0/scanner/scanner.go#L35) has a new `parsingOptions` field. `scanner.Flags` and `scanner.NewParser` are updated so that parsing options can be configured using CLI flags. Parsing options are passed to the `Parse` function, in [`Scanner.scanFile`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.35.0/scanner/scanner.go#L182).\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocument `DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` in [Configuring specific analyzers used by dependency scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-specific-analyzers-used-by-dependency-scanning).\n- It's only supported for npm projects.\n- It defaults to false, and dev dependencies are not skipped by default.\n- When set to `\"false\"`, dev dependencies are excluded from the scan; dev dependencies and their vulnerabilities are not reported.\n\n### Testing\n\nA new image spec (integration test) is added to `gemnasium`, to check that `devDependencies` are ignored when `DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` is `\"false\"`.\n\nAlso, the unit tests of the [npm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.35.0/scanner/parser/npm/) parser are updated, to test the extraction of the `dev` boolean field.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Update gemnasium\n   - Pass parsing options to lock file parsers.\n   - Introduce new `IncludeDev` parsing option.\n   - Update npm lock file parser to skip `dev` dependencies depending on parsing options.\n   - Update scanner to set up parsing options based on CLI flags.\n   - Add image spec for npm project when `DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` is `\"false\"`.\n- [x] Update documentation\n   - Document `DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES`.\n- [x] Create issues to cover all package managers supported by Gemnasium.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-10T19:02:50.747Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T16:35:35.169Z","closed_at":"2022-06-08T21:42:00.986Z","closed_by":{"id":11279441,"username":"hacks4oats","name":"Oscar Tovar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11279441/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hacks4oats"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","customer","devops::secure","feature::enhancement","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:14.10","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":11279441,"username":"hacks4oats","name":"Oscar Tovar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11279441/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hacks4oats"}],"author":{"id":5056786,"username":"jrandazzo","name":"Joe Randazzo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbbcc6722f753b2acad3436217cda749?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jrandazzo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11279441,"username":"hacks4oats","name":"Oscar Tovar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11279441/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hacks4oats"},"user_notes_count":56,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":22,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227861","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227861","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227861/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227861/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227861","relative":"#227861","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227861"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2743,"epic":{"id":24857,"iid":2743,"title":"Add variable to ignore development, test dependencies in Dependency Scanning","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2743","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":54308968,"iid":227853,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove 2 code owner feature flags","description":"Shipping a fix for the web request code owner bugs (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31283) involved adding 2 feature flags, `skip_web_ui_code_owner_validations` and `use_legacy_codeowner_validations`.

If we download file from Source directly in sidekiq, does that skip workhorse? Can we prevent that and do workhorse download? This is not good because downloading 45Gb archive occupies sidekiq thread that could have been used to do something else that is more useful.

For export, implement a set of Export endpoints for groups and projects. Limit those endpoints to 1 relation only, e.g. Group \u0026 it's children and project with issues. Such endpoint accepts a singular relation attribute and returns paginated result.\n1. For import, implement bulk import endpoint, similar to file based approach, accepting Source credentials, and group id.\n1. Similar to file based approach, orchestration mechanism will be required with an importing strategy. E.g. a) Import group and it's children b) Populate all groups with data (epics) using API c) Import project git repo d) populate issues via API calls\n\nImmediate concerns:\n\n1. We still need to store project git bundle somewhere. How do bitbucket/github do that when we perform import? Do we need to even use the bundle to perform import?\n1. Keeping scalability in mind, having thousands of issues/MRs/epics will produce a lot of http requests. Network requests can introduce latency, 500s, timeouts.

Some of these asynch processes being: \n- setting propagations\n- cache clearing\n- record indexing\n- sidekiq worker queues\n\nWhat this has led to is filing issues like this https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/issues/395 that are requesting that logs be made available to test executors to verify certain preconditions are met on the server before executing certain verification steps of end to end tests. This, however, is incompatible with the philosophy behind black-box testing. The test is meant to emulate the experience of an end user, and end users are not able to introspect the state of the server or examine log files (typically).\n\nAs an alternative, we (the quality department) have opted to insert hard wait times, and retry loops into various steps of the test to try to wait until elasticsearch is ready to accept queries. I posit that this is not a good idea in terms of test efficiency, usability, or customer experience because nested wait times extend the execution time of a test into lengths that are inefficient to run and also would be an unpleasant user experience.   \n\nNote: this idea was first discussed here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220246#note_374576598\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease briefly describe what part of the code base needs to be refactored.\n--\u003e\n\n## Improvements\n\nA path forward: in order to simplify the tests and ensure a quality user experience, I'm proposing we do elasticsearch end to end testing in a different way.\n1. Start a container with elasticsearch installed (and turned on: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209122)\n2. Add a record to GitLab (using the API would be fastest)\n3. Start a loop that terminates after time X\n4. Search for the record while time is less than X\n5. If record found in that time PASS, else FAIL\n\nThat's it. No nested try loops. No introspection of the server logs. Just keep searching until we find the record or exceed the time threshold \"X\", where X is an amount of time that a user expects to wait, on average, for a record to be searchable. If we fail to retrieve a record in that time something has gone wrong. It doesn't really matter where, from the user perspective. If some critical piece of tech failed to start then an earlier unit or acceptance test should have caught that. \n\nWhat this kind of test will tell us is that if our aggregate asynch times add up to more than the reasonable wait time X then we're taking too long somewhere and we should examine why. That is what this kind of testing will alert us to, and we can stop adding arbitrary wait times into the existing tests when elasticsearch isn't responding appropriately.\n\n\nTo consider for future iterations: we could implement various time thresholds that would indicate the severity of the problem, much like https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity\n\u003c!--\nExplain the benefits of refactoring this code.\nSee also https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/index.html#say-why-not-just-what\n--\u003e\n\n## Risks\n\nSince this kind of test has the potential to run for X amount of time (plus setup time) it may be more prudent to run this test less frequently, as in the nightly pipeline. Also there's the potential of this kind of test breaking due to flakiness or broken infrastructure and not because of a problem in elasticsearch.\n\nRunning tests less frequently gives is poorer time resolution into when things break.  \n\n@JohnMcGuire we'll need a value for \"X\" here that I'm hoping you can help provide.\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease list features that can break because of this refactoring and how you intend to solve that.\n--\u003e\n\n## Involved components\nElasticsearch\nElasticsearch API\n\n\n\u003c!--\nList files or directories that will be changed by the refactoring.\n--\u003e\n\n## Optional: Intended side effects\n\n\u003c!--\nIf the refactoring involves changes apart from the main improvements (such as a better UI), list them here.\nIt may be a good idea to create separate issues and link them here.\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\nThere may be areas of unit or integration testing that we could improve upon with respect to ensuring all the components of elasticsearch are working properly before doing this kind of end to end test. I will need to conduct an audit of our lower level elasticsearch tests to know for sure.\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are aware of tests that need to be written or adjusted apart from unit tests for the changed components,\nplease list them here.\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-10T01:39:54.496Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T17:36:23.088Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T19:19:39.621Z","closed_by":{"id":4945780,"username":"ebanks","name":"Erick Banks","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80fec5512e3a226d9fd734eb8875d4e5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebanks"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","devops::data_stores","group::global search","section::enablement","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4945780,"username":"ebanks","name":"Erick Banks","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80fec5512e3a226d9fd734eb8875d4e5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebanks"}],"author":{"id":4945780,"username":"ebanks","name":"Erick Banks","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80fec5512e3a226d9fd734eb8875d4e5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebanks"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4945780,"username":"ebanks","name":"Erick Banks","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80fec5512e3a226d9fd734eb8875d4e5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebanks"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227724","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227724","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227724/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227724/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227724","relative":"#227724","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227724"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4235,"epic":{"id":97057,"iid":4235,"title":"Improve end to end tests for elasticsearch","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4235","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 15, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":54217874,"iid":227721,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support HTTP Basic authentication in API Fuzzing","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nAs a user, I want to test web APIs authenticated with HTTP Basic authentication, so I can get better results from API Fuzzing.\n\nCurrent support for HTTP Basic requires the user to perform an extra steps.

Or do we need separate issues?\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* Deleting a package requires Admin+ permissions\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Create a speed run demonstrating the behavior for the release post (PM)\n* Update https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/#delete-a-package to include how to delete several packages at once\n\n### Data\n\n- Measure the number of clicks of `select all`, `delete`, and `confirm delete` using Snowplow.\n\n### Implementation guide\n\n- Use `left-action` slot of `list-row` component within https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/packages_and_registries/package_registry/components/list/package_list_row.vue#L93 to render `GlCheckbox`\n- Use deletePackages [mutation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/100386#gear-how-to-set-up-and-validate-locally) to handle deletion\n- Add `select all` functionality which is applicable only for a single page. max 20 items\n- Show modal for confirmation\n- Track clicks as per data section above\n\n### Links / references\n\n- Similar issue for the container registry: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336934+\n- Similar implementation for package assets: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/93169+","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-09T23:35:12.652Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T18:14:21.774Z","closed_at":"2022-11-16T04:29:32.502Z","closed_by":{"id":11214192,"username":"rchanila","name":"Rahul Chanila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11214192/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchanila"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Low SUS Score","OKR","Package:P1","SUS::Impacting","Track Health Status","UX","UX scorecard-rec","devops::package","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::package registry","missed:13.4","missed:13.5","section::ops","severity::2","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":11214192,"username":"rchanila","name":"Rahul Chanila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11214192/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchanila"},{"id":11435284,"username":"Ffinnis","name":"Roman Potapov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/737599e211a25aa4c71adfaa6ce5245a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Ffinnis"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11214192,"username":"rchanila","name":"Rahul Chanila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11214192/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rchanila"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227715","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227715","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227715/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227715/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227715","relative":"#227715","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227715"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8022,"epic":{"id":518276,"iid":8022,"title":"Bulk delete packages and package assets from the UI","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8022","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"},{"id":54189249,"iid":227714,"project_id":278964,"title":"Delete packages from your Group-level Package Registry view","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

comment:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220934/designs/Integrations.png#note_370922601\n\nHowever, it failed to clear my open todo where I had been mentioned.\n\n## Proposal\n\nResolving a discussion would mark-as-done a Todo that was generated by _any_ comment within that discussion thread (like a reply). We would only mark-as-done a Todo of the user who resolved the discussion, and _not_ any Todos for other users within the discussion.\n\n## Backlog Refinement by @alexkalderimis:\n\n**Documentation needed:**\n\nYes, both in design management documentation and for todos.\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**\n\n- Feature test for happy path (click to resolve comment, TODO not seen on todo\nlist)\n- Unit tests for service level\n- Controller/Request tests for edge\n\n**Security Tests Planned:**\n\nNone\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**\n\nAdd behaviour in current resolution mechanism (`Discussions::ResolveService`) to\nclear the todo matching the note if there is one.\n\n**MR Breakdown:**\n\nSince this is fixing a bug, rather than adding a new feature, I do not think we\nneed a new feature flag, and can complete this in a single MR.\n\nThe feature test could be its own MR if desired.\n\n**Weight Estimate:**  2\n\n---\n\n## Backlog Refinement by @.Luke:\n\n**Documentation needed:**  \n\nYes. [To the Todos docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/todos.html#marking-a-to-do-as-done).\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**  \n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**  \n\nTodos have an association with the `note` as well as to the `target`, so we have the data recorded that we need. \n\nThe trickiness is that there is more than one way to resolve a discussion: A discussion is a PORO that is considered resolved when all of the comments within it are resolved. Some parts of GitLab resolve a discussion or note without going through the service to do this. \n\nFor design management, we could ignore some of that, and just tack some extra logic into `Discussions::ResolveService` somewhere, as within design management people can only resolve discussions and not individual notes. In future `Notes::ResolveService` could call something similar if needed, in order to trigger the logic when the last note of a discussion is resolved, (or now, if ~\"group::source code\" also want this feature for merge requests https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227691#note_381903509).\n\n**MR Breakdown:**\n\n- 1-2 MRs to add the feature\n- 1 MR to remove the feature flag\n \n**Weight Estimate:**  \n\n3\n\n---\n## Backlog Refinement by @toupeira:\n\n**Documentation needed:**  Describe the new behaviour in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/todos.html#marking-a-to-do-as-done.\n\n**Test Activity Planned:**  Unit specs, and maybe a feature spec to play through the scenario in the browser.\n\n**Security Tests Planned:**  None\n\n**Explanation for Approach to be taken:**  Not sure yet, in case we want to do the same for MR discussions.\n\n**MR Breakdown:** Not sure yet.\n \n**Weight Estimate:**

The changes include: \n1. Include a new \"History\" feed that shares the time-based metadata related to a package.\n1. Next show the Install commands and registry setup instructions\n1. Add an \"Additional Metadata\" to capture any non-time related metadata. This additional metadata section offers the flexibility of including a variety of details specific to different package formats. \n\n| Updated UI |\n|---|\n|![227582_-_New_Package_Detail](/uploads/da135653598009361608b0f174b68d3a/227582_-_New_Package_Detail.png)|\n\n:warning: This change will probably require multiple MRs and possibly need a feature flag :warning: \n\n### Further details\n\nThe history section specifically includes the following data points: \n\n  - Package creation\n  - Package update (if applicable) \n  - Commit and Branch time and related data\n  - Pipeline time and data \n  - Published to the registry data\n\nThe additional metadata section will require each new type of data points to be looked at to form the correct \"sentence\" since this is no longer a key|value pair.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nn/a\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdates to the screenshots inside the documentation may be required. \n\nWe may also need to update or clarify the documentation when speaking specifically to what different data points are.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

At this point, we are only reducing the tests if a failure occurs. The full test suite is still run for a complete pipeline. This is similar to the `Verify/FailFast` template in principle, but suited into the GitLab project.\n\n1. Add a new job to run identified tests (similar to `rspec foss impact`, but to include `ee`) as a preceding stage to other `rspec` jobs\n2. Store the test files that are executed as artifact for subsequent rspec jobs to exclude from their executions.\n\nA simplified pipeline would be something like the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"rspec minimal\u003cbr /\u003erun tests for changed files\";\n        A[\"rspec impact\"];\n        B[\"rspec foss impact\"];\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"rspec full suite\u003cbr /\u003erun all remaining tests\";\n        D[\"rspec migration\"];\n        E[\"rspec unit\"];\n        F[\"rspec integration\"];\n        G[\"rspec system\"];\n    end\n\n    A --\u003e H\n    H[\"artifact: test files executed\"]\n\n\n    H --exclude from--\u003e D\n    H --exclude from--\u003e E\n    H --exclude from--\u003e F\n    H --exclude from--\u003e G\n```\n\nUpdate: After [experimenting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227531#note_405793935) on @godfat-gitlab 's suggestion, we could run the impact test in parallel to other tests. We then cancel the pipeline when the impact test fails. This balances between saving cost from long running jobs, as well as avoiding additional pipeline duration.\n\n## Expected result\n\nWe can expect the following impact:\n- Reduced number of jobs being executed in failing pipelines, as there is less rspec jobs to be executed. This translates to reduction in average per pipeline CI cost.\n- There may be tradeoff in pipeline duration from adding a new job-stage but there would also be less rspec tests to run in the full suite.\n\n## Edge cases\n\n- Some MRs may have too many changes, causing a job timeout, similar to the case for `rspec foss impact` (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220883). In this case, we don't need to fail the job, but pass through to the full suite to run all the tests.\n\n## Verify that the solution has improved the situation\n\n- [ ] The solution improved the situation.\n  - If yes, check this box and close the issue. Well done! :tada:\n  - Otherwise, create a new \"Productivity Improvement\" issue. You can re-use the description from this issue, but obviously another solution should be chosen this time.\n\n## Open questions:\n\n1. What is the tradeoff in the pipeline duration?\n1. Do we need to split the impact test into levels `unit`, `migration`, `integration`, `system` as well?\n1. Do we need parallel jobs on the impact test?\n1. Would this make the pipeline overly complex? How can we keep it simple?\n1. How would this complicate metadata such as `coverage`, `flaky tests`, `rspec metadata`?\n1. How would this be interoperable with `master` pipelines?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-09T03:54:53.703Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:56:28.918Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T06:03:39.320Z","closed_by":{"id":461042,"username":"caalberts","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/461042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caalberts"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","ep::pipeline","maintenance::pipelines","missed:13.4","priority::2","type::maintenance","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":461042,"username":"caalberts","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/461042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caalberts"}],"author":{"id":461042,"username":"caalberts","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/461042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caalberts"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":461042,"username":"caalberts","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/461042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caalberts"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227531","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227531","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227531/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/227531/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#227531","relative":"#227531","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#227531"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6609,"epic":{"id":332485,"iid":6609,"title":"Selective Test Execution Backend: Rspec optimizations","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6609","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":54121275,"iid":227507,"project_id":278964,"title":"Disable/Enable \"Reveal variables\"","description":"\u003c!-- The first four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

If the API calls to GitLab fail, we do not indicate a problem with the Container Registry, but instead return nil values.  This is a serious problem as scripts may rely on the ability to find tags to determine if an object needs to be built.  This can lead to unnecessary rebuilds.  It would appear that our API may not be properly returning a valid response to the user when the Container Registry is suffering a problem.\n\nSee the original comment in that issue here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/2381#note_375972108\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Intentionally shutdown the Container Registry service\n1. Perform various operations against the Container Registry:\n    * Make an API call to find an image\n    * Tell a CI job to pull an image\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API will respond noting that the Docker image tag does not exist.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe API should return an error.\n\n### Proposal \n\nUpdate the copy when an error due to the registry being unavailable occurs. This impacts both the API and the UI. \n\n#### User interface\n`We are having trouble connecting to the Container Registry. Please try refreshing the page. \nIf this error persists, please review the troubleshooting documentation.`\n\n#### API\n`We are having trouble connecting to the Container Registry.

Even if the code is not ready to be merged. In order to signal to others that a contribution is not ready to be reviewed/merged, we can prefix the merge request title with `draft` (formerly known as `wip`). This is useful, however, it entails going into edit mode, navigating to the merge request title, and typing the required prefix.\n\nTo make it easier to use this feature, we have introduced the `Mark as draft` button to merge requests. With a single click, you can indicate your work is in progress and not ready to be merged/reviewed.\n\n## UX Research\nIn the Category Maturity Testing for Code Review, the WIP feature for Merge Requests is not easily discoverable. The most common ways participants signaled the in-progress status of the MR was by 1) closing the MR or 2) applying a label.
