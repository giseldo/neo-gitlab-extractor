this error message:\n\n```\nerror: (CC::CLI::Analyze::EngineFailure) engine eslint failed with status 1 and stderr \nModule not supported: eslint-plugin-@typescript-eslint\nModule not supported:

follows (most notably, it enables TypeScript support):\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n    \"env\": {\n        \"browser\": true,\n        \"es6\": true,\n        \"node\": true\n    },\n

\"SharedArrayBuffer\": \"readonly\"\n    },\n    \"parser\": \"@typescript-eslint/parser\",\n    \"parserOptions\": {\n        \"ecmaVersion\": 2018,\n        \"sourceType\": \"module\"\n    },\n    \"plugins\": [\n        \"@typescript-eslint\"\n    ],\n    \"rules\": {\n    },\n    \"overrides\": [\n        {\n            \"files\": \"**/*.ts\",\n            \"rules\": {\n                // There's a TypeScript-specific version of this rule;\n                // we disable the generic one, because it thinks imported types are unused\n                // when they're not:\n                \"no-unused-vars\": \"off\",\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n};\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis surfaced in this commit:

However, projects are excluded from scope - on create, update, and delete, we continue to schedule `ElasticIndexerWorker` jobs instead.\n\nThis is that there is considerable *additional* work done by `ElasticIndexerWorker` for projects on creation and deletion (update is fine as-is, but separating it out was too much work).\n\n## Improvements\n\n### Create\n\nWe need to refactor these operations so they are handled correctly with the bulk-incremental worker.\n\nOn creation, the main missing thing appears to be that the project wiki is not correctly indexed - although this appears to be a problem for the `ElasticIndexerWorker` approach too: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/207491\n\nWe should refactor `ElasticIndexerWorker` so there is no reference to `ElasticCommitIndexerWorker` in it.\n\nIt also schedules an initial bulk import for each of the indexable associations that are in the project. This already seems to be handled correctly by the bulk-incremental indexer (since as the importer creates each issue, its on-create callbacks are run, scheduling an operation), but this should be verified.\n\n`IndexRecordService` is also used for backfill, so we can't *remove* this code entirely - but we need to ensure that when a project is imported while elasticsearch is turned on, everything in the project is indexed correctly without an `ElasticIndexerWorker` being scheduled.\n\n### Update\n\nNo action needed\n\n### Delete\n\nWhen a project is deleted, we rely on database foreign key constraints to remove many records, so elasticsearch hooks are not fired. Additionally, commit and blob documents are guaranteed to be left behind without further action.\n\nTo handle this, [`ElasticIndexerWorker` runs a \"delete by query\" command](ee/app/workers/elastic_indexer_worker.rb#L50) - it also manually deletes the `IndexStatus` row, although I'm not sure that's necessary.\n\nThe incremental-bulk indexer doesn't handle this at all right now, and would leave behind orphaned records.\n\nI think the best approach here might be to create a specific \"erase project from elasticsearch\" worker, and have it be scheduled separately at project-delete time, rather than trying to fit this special-casing into the elastic-bulk flow specifically.\n\n## Risks\n\n\n\n## Involved components\n\n* [`ProjectsSearch`](ee/app/models/concerns/elastic/projects_search.rb)\n* [`ElasticIndexerWorker`](ee/app/workers/elastic_indexer_worker.rb)\n\n\n## Optional: Missing test coverage\n\nWe are lacking tests that import a project with elasticsearch enabled and ensure that all records that should be searchable, are searchable. This would be a great time to add them.\n\nWe also lack tests that run a `ProjectDestroyWorker` for a fully-indexed project and ensures that all the documents for that project (but not other documents) are removed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-21T12:53:21.974Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:24:35.516Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T07:02:23.860Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","advanced search","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::data_stores","group::global search","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5054237,"username":"dgruzd","name":"Dmitry Gruzd","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054237/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dgruzd"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207494","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207494","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207494/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207494/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207494","relative":"#207494","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207494"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2526,"epic":{"id":18587,"iid":2526,"title":"Increase the stability of Advanced Search pipeline","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2526","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 21, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31117833,"iid":207486,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make `store_first_mentioned_in_commit_on_issue_close` feature flag default on","description":"Make `store_first_mentioned_in_commit_on_issue_close` feature flag default on after the feature is verified on production.

This is what winds up in our test summary.\n\nThe good news is that the jobs that exhibit this problem all have the same denominator leftover in the `group_name`, so they are aggregating correctly in the test summary. They just have a slightly uglier name.\n\nIn a recent [pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines/193676267), the following configuration:\n\n```yaml\n.rspec-unit-parallel:\n  parallel: 20\n\nrspec unit pg11:\n  extends:\n    - .rspec-base-pg11\n    - .rails:rules:ee-and-foss-unit\n    - .rspec-unit-parallel\n```\n\ncreated the following jobs:\n\n![image](/uploads/3aaa5f8c4c079739c576e7944f17f6b5/image.png)\n\nwhich displays the incorrectly formatted `group_name`, the same display used by our Test Report Summary:\n\n![image](/uploads/a1268a60abcb5c532047dc11839e2c79/image.png)\n\nIt's not just us mangling our own `X/Y` suffix either; we actually removed \"11\" from the end of the job name. It's written that way to specify that the build is run using PostgreSQL 11, and we truncate that information.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nWe should expect that none of the parallelization details show up on the end of the job name. The pattern we use appears to be intended to work that way, but doesn't only doesn't because it overlaps with another pattern that's subbed first.\n\n### Small Proposal\n\nOff the top of my head, we could set the middle `separator` followed by `digit` as a match group, and allow it to be matched repeatedly, while maintaining that the whole pattern begins with a digit and ends in a digit optionally followed by any amount of whitespace. i.e.\n\n```\n%r{\\d+[\\s:\\/\\\\]+\\d+\\s*}\n```\n\nbecoming\n\n```\n%r{\\d+([\\s:\\/\\\\]+\\d+)+\\s*}\n```\n\nI don't know that it's the *best* option, but it's an acute fix for our own job group names.\n\n### Large Proposal\n\nWe could stop relying on a magic regex, because we don't really know how any given CI project is going to name its jobs, and subbing on any pattern at all makes assumptions that won't necessarily hold true. We should consider figuring out how to remember the original job names from before we parallelized and renamed them.\n\n### Associated Risks\n\nChanging group name could affect a wide array of jobs across GitLab installations, and if users are using group name on builds that have similar patterns over the API for example, this could potentially break something. I have not done any investigation into the scope of this risk.\n\n### Original Issue writeup\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen tests in a single suite are parallelized, each parallel job presents as it's own suite in the merge request widget. This creates a a ton of noise in the widget that provides no added value.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun a full pipeline on the `gitlab-org/gitlab` project with a failing RSpec test and expand the merge request widget.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25256\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMultiple parallel RSpec jobs are listed as separate suites named `rspec/1`, `rspec/2`, `rspec/3`, ...\n\nThis is especially confusing with our own job names like `rspec unit pg9` and `rspec unit pg/24`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nA single test suite summary should be gathered into a single widget row regardless of parallelization. Parallelization is an implementation detail that the spec summary shouldn't be concerned with at all.\n\nClicking on a particular error link in the summary should still connect to the underlying `/#` job.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/6c8200f27022cfa2a36b5543ac74301e/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1) We could detect parallelized jobs and detach the `/#` suffixes from the suites when we gather the artifacts from jobs.\n2) We could defer on this until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37725 is closed and we're no longer fetching artifact data directly from the artifacts themselves. It's also possible that fixing TestReports and TestSuite to aggregate parallelized job reports will be a step on the way to `PipelineMetrics`, but I don't know yet.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Rollout via Feature Flag\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322080","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-21T10:44:03.011Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T07:07:44.746Z","closed_at":"2021-03-01T21:29:17.958Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.9","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","type::feature","unit testing","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"}],"author":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207485","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207485","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207485/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207485/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207485","relative":"#207485","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207485"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5205,"epic":{"id":181128,"iid":5205,"title":"Bugs: Testing","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5205","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":31109162,"iid":207474,"project_id":278964,"title":"Roll Out confidential_notes","description":"## What\n\nRemove the `:confidential_notes` feature flag ...\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::product planning\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_product-planning`\n- Best individual to reach out to: `@felipe_artur`, `@jprovaznik`, `@egrieff`\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early.

this:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003esearch.maven.org\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n[![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/c1b9ae13a984fee536d8c7141a8c91b5/image.png)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.uber/rave/2.2.0/jar)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nA possible solution could be to introduce some tabs or a dropdown (with the choices: Apache Maven, Gradle Groovy DSL, Gradle Kotlin DSL) here:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eGitLab package setup info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n[![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/cee97b2a846fc558ffb146232540123a/image.png)](https://gitlab.com/cromefire_/jellyfin-apiclient-kotlin/-/packages/464389)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nAnother thing to consider there is that it might be smart to remember what the user had selected last time to reduce the amount of clicks needed.\n\nOther registries providing the feature:\n\n* Maven Central: https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.uber/rave/2.2.0/jar\n* Bintray: https://bintray.com/kotlin/ktor/ktor/1.4.0 (a bit hidden under \"Maven build settings\")\n\nSome references/examples:\n\n* Dependency:\n  * Example: https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.uber/rave/2.2.0/jar\n  * Documentation: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management_for_java_projects.html#sec:module_dependencies_java_tutorial\n* Repository:\n  * Documentation: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sec:maven_repo\n\nIf specific examples/templates (for example for the docs or for the package details) are needed, I can probably provide those\n\n# Proposal \n\nCreate a dropdown control that allows users to select which set of commands will be visible in the package detail UI. \n\n| Design proposal |\n|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_14.28.40](/uploads/55b5c0005daddb3ce7ffc4c98651c083/Screen_Shot_2021-02-08_at_14.28.40.png)|\n\n### Further Details \n\n- This setting should be saved per user across all projects. This would mean that if a user selects `gradle`, the next time they look at a Maven package, the `gradle` instruction options should be shown by default. \n- We should continue to show the command even if a package format only has 1 option currently for consistency.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-21T08:26:37.150Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T01:18:23.866Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T10:06:57.271Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Maven Repository","Package:P1","devops::package","documentation","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::package registry","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicol√≤ Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207467","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207467","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207467/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207467/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207467","relative":"#207467","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207467"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31105387,"iid":207465,"project_id":278964,"title":"Right sidebar initial state wrong if collapsed_gutter cookie not set","description":"1. delete the `collapsed_gutter` cookie\n2. open a new tab set screen width to \u003c768px.

This also strips out the `data-html=\"true\"` that we set causing the tooltip to be rendered that way. We should probably add `data-html` to the whitelist.\n\nWe also [remove empty links](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/329e7b4830ae53f91a922452d0c34c21f6fc5384/app/helpers/markup_helper.rb#L96) because we were assuming that these are left behind after removing the images.

endpoint on the instance security dashboard","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThe underlying data model for findings is complex and results in slow querying. Using vulnerabilities will improve the load time and is a necessary piece of the transition to first class vulnerabilities.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team

Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Proposal\n\nReplace the vulnerability findings history endpoint with a history of vulnerabilities, using GraphQL data that includes the history of vulnerabilities for all projects on the current user's instance security dashboard.\n\n#### GraphQL schema\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  vulnerabilities {\n    history(daysAgo: 30) {\n      nodes {\n        date\n        summary {\n          critical\n          high\n          medium\n          low\n          info\n          undefined\n          unknown\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Development plan\n\n- [ ] ~backend Add a method for getting vulnerability history as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201792\n- [ ] ~backend Add a GraphQL type for representing vulnerability history as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201792\n- [ ] ~backend Add the history to the `QueryType` level vulnerability data\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nGraphQL should have the same permissions scheme as the instance security dashboard.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] Determine whether any screenshots or information in the instance security dashboard docs need to be updated.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- [ ] No more timeouts from the instance dashboard vulnerability history feature\n- [ ] `EXPLAIN` plan for new endpoint shows significantly better performance\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references\n\n1st class vulnerabilities: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/13561\n\nOther issues that this will fix (for the instance

Proposal\n\n![new-counts](/uploads/e4cbd0f1fbbbafcf830bc8a5741ed262/new-counts.png)\n\n\n- Update the counters to a new style: \n  - title background: `#fafafa`\n  - background: `#ffffff`\n  - box-shadow: `0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.08);` \n  - title: h3 `#2e2e2e`\n  - number: h2 `#2e2e2e`\n- Add severity icons to the single stat headers \n- move counters to above the filters\n- No behavioral change desired from what is in place today. This is just an aesthetic

fails","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen a customer runs a DAST scan, often they want to login to their application so that DAST can scan everything that is behind a login gateway. Many login screens require JavaScript, so DAST provides a way to do it using Selenium driving a Browser. The customer specifies the required environment variables, and before accessing the target website DAST will drive the browser to fill out the login form. After the login has been submitted, DAST queries Selenium for Cookies, and sets them all as authentication cookies in ZAProxy.\n\nUnfortunately an issue occurs when for some reason the login fails. Examples of failures include:\n- Incorrect username\n- Incorrect password\n- Incorrect user name field\n- Incorrect password field\n- The form may have changed to introduce another required field (e.g. terms and conditions must be accepted)\n- The URL of the login form may have changed\n\nMany sites will send a 200 response code, with a message that \"Login failed\". In these cases, the login attempt is considered as successful from a DAST perspective as it is not looking intelligently at the response.    \n\nDAST will then continue (potentially for hours!) to execute the scan, missing much of the content that would normally be scanned, and therefore appearing as if many vulnerabilities have been fixed.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] The customer can supply another environment variable, `DAST_AUTH_URL_VERIFICATION`. \n- [ ] The variable is optional, even if other authentication parameters are provided.\n- [ ] The variable should map to a CLI argument `--auth-url-verification`. \n- [ ] This variable should contain a URL that is only accessible when the user provided in `DAST_USERNAME` is logged in.\n- [ ] After DAST attempts to log the user in, DAST will contact the `DAST_AUTH_URL_VERIFICATION` using the authentication cookies. \n- [ ] If DAST does not get a response in the `200-299` range then the login will be considered to be unsuccessful.\n\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe new environment variable should be added to the documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#available-variables.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability?

The desired behaviour is that all users of design management are able to move all pins (even those that are not their own).\n\n### Intended users\n\nAll users of design management\n\n### Backend Proposal\n\n1. Add a new permission on `Note` called `:reposition_note`. This would be the same as `:admin_note` but would additionally be `true` if `noteable` is a `Design` and user can `:create_note` on the `Design`.\n1. Expose new `:reposition_note` permission in GraphQL `NotePermissions` type.\n1. Add a new `repositionImageDiffNote` mutation, that takes `note_id`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` args. `note_id` must be the Global ID of a `DiffNote`. User must have `:reposition_note` permission on the note. (The name of the mutation has been chosen to be consistent with the existing note mutation naming conventions)\n\n### Frontend Proposal\n\n~frontend will need to update note-moving logic to cater for the new mutation and/or scope \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n- ~frontend will need to update jest specs that check for inability to move a note without `adminNote` permission.\n- Unit tests of new mutation (including authorization, error messages, and what happens when not passed a note global id)\n\n### Links / references\n\n* This was originally discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34353#note_279883816\n\n--- \n\n### Testing Activity\n\n@alexkalderimis \n* Yes, at the service, mutation and feature level\n\n@.luke \n* Unit tests + request test of mutation, including authorization\n\n### MR Breakdown\n\n@alexkalderimis \n* The issue is well specified. The intent is to add a new mutation solely for repositioning notes given the `:create_note` permission. This will require a new mutation, possibly a new service and new request and feature specs\n     * Could be done in one, but it will be on the chunky side.

Editing a configuration file and redeploying an environment is time-consuming and not intuitive.  This approach makes it difficult to have the feature on by default.\n1. Question: What other options are available to disable Cilium?\n\nIn the event that Cilium is causing performance or connectivity problems, the user needs to be able to disable Cilium quickly and easily on a per-environment basis in the GitLab UI.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n\u003c!-- Personas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\nAlthough we hope that performance problems with Cilium will never happen or will be caught in testing, there is always a risk that a problem exists as Cilium interacts with customer-specific environments.  There also is a risk that the customer has introduced a connectivity problem via the policies that they have configured.  Being able to turn Cilium quickly helps to mitigate this risk.  This is an MVC designed to help users quickly disable in the event of a problem.\n\n### Problems to be solved\n1. How to enable/disable Network Policies / Cilium will be discoverable by users in the GitLab UI\n1. Users will be able to quickly disable Cilium in the event that it is disrupting their production environment\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Provide a GUI to allow users to view the installed/uninstalled state of Cilium\n1. Provide a link to documentation on installing/uninstalling Cilium from the UI\n\n### Design: \n\n| Cilium not enabled | Cilium Enabled |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Enable-Disable_CnP](/uploads/7e76882b42eb64867270b3e4bc399495/Enable-Disable_CnP.png)  |   ![Disable_CnP_Installed](/uploads/b3ddd91d5faa54107d46758daa4f3c18/Disable_CnP_Installed.png) | \n\n* [x] UI finalized \n* [x] Interactions finalized\n* [ ] Text finalized\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOld proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Design: \n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-04-16_at_11.34.08_AM](/uploads/2a23904c9791fedce31ef8afbd978e37/Screen_Shot_2020-04-16_at_11.34.08_AM.png)\n\nChanges and additions: \n\n- New page header \n- New section header for the existing secure features\n  - Remove blue banner at the top of the page and use the banner copy as sub-text under the section header\n- New section for Monitoring \u0026 Response features\n- Add modsecurity list item \n  - include mod security status \n  - include a link to mod security GitLab docs\n  - include a button that links to the managed apps page\n- Add Cilium list item\n  - include cilium status \n  - include a link to cilium GitLab docs\n  - include a button that links to the cilium configuration section of GitLab docs \n\n:warning: Note that if fetching the status is out of scope then remove the status column for the Monitoring \u0026 Response section only\n\n\n### Experience: \n1. When Cilium is turned on or off, if it is predicted to take \u003c10 seconds, then we can just do a spinner. If it will take longer (measured in minutes) then we will likely want to inform them that it could take up to x minutes for the changes to take effect.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nUsers must be a Maintainer or Owner on the project.

asset types in Releases","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe want to allow users to specify asset types in a Release entry, so that they can categorize runbooks in the Release page.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product

Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Technical proposal\n\nAdd a `link_type` property to the asset link API response that indicates the type of link (valid values are `runbook`, `image`, `package` and `other`):\n\n```json\n\"assets\":{\n\n    ...\n\n    \"links\":[\n      {\n          \"id\":2,\n          \"name\":\"awesome-v0.2.msi\",\n          \"url\":\"http://192.168.10.15:3000/msi\",\n          \"external\":true,\n          \"link_type\": \"runbook\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"id\":1,\n

be hidden behind a feature flag named `release_asset_link_type`.\n\n#### User story\n\n\u003e As a Release Manager, I want to specify the asset type I am linking to my release, so that can I better inform users of the item's importance.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:**\n\n- While creating/editing a release, user should be able to specify the type of links added to a Release.\n  -  Using GitLab's UI, by selecting an option in the form using a dropdown menu.\n- The attribute is not mandatory.\n- Links types should be displayed as follows:\n  - Runbook\n  - Package \n  - Image \n  - Other (selected by default)\n- After successfully creating the release item, the information with the Link type should be displayed in the newly created Release item (view page).\n\n## Design proposal\n\n| desktop |

Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\nYes, we will need to document this feature.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-19T15:32:47.926Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T21:59:11.286Z","closed_at":"2020-06-27T00:10:08.890Z","closed_by":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P1","UX","backend","backend-weight::3","cicd::active","devops::release","direction","feature::enhancement","frontend","frontend-weight::2","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},{"id":3079878,"username":"rayana","name":"Rayana Verissimo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3079878/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rayana"},{"id":4391348,"username":"sean_carroll","name":"Sean Carroll","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4391348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sean_carroll"}],"author":{"id":4905402,"username":"jreporter","name":"Jackie Porter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4905402/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jreporter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"user_notes_count":56,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207257","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207257","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207257/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207257/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207257","relative":"#207257","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207257"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2664,"epic":{"id":20923,"iid":2664,"title":"Support release plan runbook visibility","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2664","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31030354,"iid":207250,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow admins to modify MR approval settings at the project-level after enabling them in admin area","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe implemented https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/39060 in %\"12.8\", but now need to iterate on that implementation to improve a potentially-unexpected behavior.

What\n\nEnable the `:snippets_vue` feature flag by default.\n\nAfter https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34820 has been done behind the `:snippets_vue` feature flag, the  flag has been enabled globally on gitlab.com at the end of %12.9 and was enabled during the whole %\"12.10\" without any major issue. A couple of minor visual glitches were promptly fixed at the end of %12.9. So it is considered to be pretty safe to enable this feature by default.\n\n### Why not removing the flag completely?\n\nThere are some [questions related to feature specs and QA tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214761) that need to be addressed before the flag can be removed completely.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Create::Editor (Frontend)\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_editor`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @dmishunov @fjsanpedro \n\n## Expectations\n\n###¬†What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe view of a Snippet should not change much. Some of the icons are supposed to look different (due to the use of *gitlab-ui*).\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early. Some organizations may wish to test big changes they are interested in with a small subset of users ahead of time for example.\n\n- `gitlab-org/gitlab` project\n- `gitlab-org`/`gitlab-com` groups\n- ...\n\n## Roll Out Steps\n\n- [x] Enable on staging\n- [x] Test on staging\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com for individual groups/projects listed above and verify behaviour\n- [ ] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with `#production` and `#g_delivery` on slack.\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production`\n- [ ] Cross post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n/cc @phikai @rkuba @fjsanpedro\n\n## Availability and Testing\nRunning `package-and-qa` before merging is strongly recommended. Please also include a SET in MR to implement necessary changes to end-to-ends and QA page objects.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-19T12:50:30.550Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T08:09:37.278Z","closed_at":"2020-05-19T08:09:37.229Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","feature flag","group::editor","quad-planning::complete-action"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"}],"author":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207235","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":11,"completed_count":5},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 11 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207235","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207235/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/207235/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#207235","relative":"#207235","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#207235"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31022625,"iid":207234,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make Cross Project Pipeline Status transition Resilient","description":"## Summary\n\nWe recently had a production incident that [Duplicate child pipelines being created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/205705). This issue is about how we can improve our CI architecture.\n\n## Problem Analysis/Reproduce the problem\n\n### Preparation\n\n- We have the [reverted code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25308) in your local GitLab instance\n- Project has the following pipeline configuration.\n\n```yml\n# .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nparent_bridge:\n  trigger:\n   include: child.yml\n```\n\n```yml\n# child.yml\n\njob:\n  script: echo\n```\n\n- We simulate that a particular process takes some time.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/services/ci/pipeline_processing/legacy_processing_service.rb b/app/services/ci/pipeline_processing/legacy_processing_service.rb\nindex 278fba20283..dfb4717d3b7 100644\n--- a/app/services/ci/pipeline_processing/legacy_processing_service.rb\n+++ b/app/services/ci/pipeline_processing/legacy_processing_service.rb\n@@ -19,7 +19,9 @@ module Ci\n         success = process_dag_builds_without_needs || success if initial_process\n         success = process_dag_builds_with_needs(trigger_build_ids) || success\n \n+        sleep 10\n         @pipeline.update_legacy_status\n+        sleep 10\n \n         success\n       end\n```\n\n### Consequence\n\nThis gives you enormous amount of errors in sidekiq log.\n\n### Process analysis\n\nWhen a new pipeline is created, the following processes are going to happen.\n\n- In `CreateCrossProjectPipelineWorker`, an upstream bridge creates a new pipeline.\n- In `Ci::CreatePipelineService`, `Pipeline::Chains` build and create a child pipeline and a job.\n- In `Ci::CreatePipelineService`,  it also executes `Ci::ProcessPipelineService`.\n- In `LegacyProcessingService`, it processes the builds at first. It triggers `PipelineUpdateWorker` asynchronously via `CommitStatus#schedule_stage_and_pipeline_update`.\n- Think that this `PipelineUpdateWorker` finishes now. Pipelines status is moved from created to pending. This also updates the `bridge`'s status to `success` via `pipeline.update_bridge_status!`.\n- In `LegacyProcessingService`, it processes `@pipeline.update_legacy_status`, which _fails to update the pipeline status_ since the pipeline status is already pending, and most importantly, `state_machine` of pipeline sets an error to `pipeline.errors`.\n- In `CreateCrossProjectPipelineService`, it executes `@bridge.drop!(:downstream_pipeline_creation_failed)`, which fails due to `ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError` because the `bridge` has already been updated above.\n- `CreateCrossProjectPipelineWorker` is retried.\n\nWe can observe this error in https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/1302952/?query=ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError.\n\n#### After Retry of `CreateCrossProjectPipelineWorker`\n\n- In `CreateCrossProjectPipelineWorker`, an upstream bridge creates a new pipeline.\n- In `Ci::CreatePipelineService`, `Pipeline::Chains` build and create a child pipeline and a job.\n- In `Ci::CreatePipelineService`,  it also executes `Ci::ProcessPipelineService`.\n- In `LegacyProcessingService`, it processes the builds at first. It triggers `PipelineUpdateWorker` asynchronously via `CommitStatus#schedule_stage_and_pipeline_update`.\n- Think that this `PipelineUpdateWorker` finishes now. Pipelines status is moved from created to pending. This also updates the `bridge`'s status to `success` via `pipeline.update_bridge_status!`. _However, since the bridge is already `success`, this process raises an error._ We can observe this error as `Ci::Pipeline::BridgeStatusError`.\n- `PipelineUpdateWorker` is retried, but it could be `CreateCrossProjectPipelineWorker` due to the asynchronous process.\n\nWe can observe this error in https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=Ci%3A%3APipeline%3A%3ABridgeStatusError\u0026statsPeriod=14d.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- [x] Make sure that `CreateCrossProjectPipelineWorker` doesn't create a duplicate pipeline when the sidekiq worker is retried.\n- [x] Make sure that we don't raise an error in `state_machine` transition, that could disturb entire pipeline/builds status transition.  See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/build.rb#L333-337 as an example.\n- [x] Make sure that we have a centralized place to update the bridge status. In this context, we should also fix https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/198354 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/202239. `Gitlab::OptimisticLocking` might be needed as well to combat race condition.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-19T12:39:03.801Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:35:46.525Z","closed_at":"2020-03-18T09:25:34.646Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio

This presents a problem that as someone using the vulnerability list, I have no idea which vulnerabilities have been addressed and which ones are still pending mitigation. \n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWhen the system no longer detects a finding that was associated with a vulnerability -in the default branch- , provide the user with some type of visual indication that this has happened.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nIt should only be accessible if the vulnerability itself could be viewed.\n\n### Documentation\n\nUpdate relevant screenshots of the product to show these messages properly.\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\nTest for both the success \u0026 error case. Ensure that the error message is appropriate for all cases or is specific to the error itself. Ensure messaging throughout the experience is clear. \n\n\u003c!-- ### What does success look like, and how can we measure that? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

container registry database schema to help drive online garbage collection","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nThe container registry utilizes the file system for storing both manifests as well as layers. This architecture means that it is not possible to run garbage collection (removing untagged layers) while the container registry is online. We're planning on implementing [online garbage collection](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2313) to allow GitLab.com and other customers to run garbage collection while their registry is online.\n\nIn order to implement online garbage collection, we will need a different method for storing metadata. A necessary step for achieving this is defining the metadata fields required by the container registry and then propose a schema for a metadata database.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis schema was designed based on the Object Specification described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207147#note_294543918 and the discussion around the possible options in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207147#note_297386977. Please refer to these comments for additional context.\n\n### Notes\n\n- There is an ongoing discussion around which database type (SQL *vs* NoSQL) and brand (e.g. PostgreSQL *vs* MongoDB/RethinkDB) should be used. This schema should be adapted once that discussion is closed. For now we assume it'll be SQL and PostgreSQL.\n\n- This schema is subject to changes during the development phase. This issue will be updated if/as those changes happen.\n\n### ER Model\n![registry](/uploads/11c00289e3cc49f2d014d07ec8dc6566/registry.png)\n[registry.dbm](/uploads/72e6fe360d61c6c3f5e13934d3e9a2a8/registry.dbm) ([pgModeler](https://github.com/pgmodeler/pgmodeler))\n\n[registry_ddl.sql](/uploads/ee9e08bbb3e01b174e072a192d67ecb0/registry_ddl.sql)\n\n### Entities\n\n#### repositories\n\n| Name           | Type        | Nullable | Constraints                   | Description                                                  |\n| -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **id**         | `serial`    | N        | `PRIMARY KEY`                 | Incremental ID.                                              |\n| **name**       | `text`      | N        |                               | This is the name of the repository, e.g. `gitlab-container-registry`. |\n| **path**       | `text`      | N        | `UNIQUE`                      | This is the full path of a repository, e.g. `gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-container-registry`. |\n| **parent_id**  | `integer`   | Y        | `REFERENCES repositories(id)` | If a repository is a root repository (e.g. `gitlab-org`), this is set to `null`.

Some NoSQL document databases also support recursive queries (e.g. [MongoDB `$graphLookup`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/)).\n\n#### manifests\n\nA repository can have many manifests (`1:N`).\n\n| Name                 | Type        | Nullable | Constraints                              | Description                                                  |\n| -------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **id**               | `serial`    | N        | `PRIMARY KEY`                            | Incremental ID.                                              |\n| **repository_id**    | `integer`   | N        | `REFERENCES repositories(id)`\u003cbr\u003e`UNIQUE (repository_id,digest)`            | The repository that this manifest belongs to.                |\n| **schema_version**   | `integer`   | N        |                                          | Image manifest schema version.                               |\n| **media_type**       | `text`      | N        |                                          | The media type of the image manifest document.               |\n| **digest**           | `text`      | N        | `UNIQUE (repository_id,digest)`                                 | The digest of the manifest.                                  |\n| **configuration_id** | `integer`   | N        | `REFERENCES manifest_configurations(id)` | Manifest configuration.                                      |\n| **payload**      | `json`     | N        |                                          | Full manifest payload that matches the advertised digest (same format and order of attributes). |\n| **created_at**       | `timestamp` | N        |                                          | Creation timestamp.                                          |\n| **marked_at**       | `timestamp` | Y        |                                          | Timestamp of the last time the manifest was marked by the garbage collector.                                          |\n| **deleted_at** | `timestamp` | Y        |                               | Soft deletion timestamp. |\n\n#### layers\n\nA manifest references a set of layers.\n\n| Name              | Type        | Nullable | Constraints                  | Description                                                |\n| ----------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **id**            | `serial`    | N        | `PRIMARY KEY`                | Incremental ID.                                            |\n| **media_type**       | `text`      | N        |                                          | The media type of the image layer.               |\n| **digest**           | `text`      | N        | `UNIQUE`                                 | The digest of the layer.                                  |\n| **created_at**    | `timestamp` | N        |                              | Creation timestamp.                                        |\n| **marked_at**       | `timestamp` | Y        |                                          | Timestamp of the last time the layer was marked by the garbage collector.                                          |\n| **deleted_at** | `timestamp` | Y        |                               | Soft deletion timestamp. |\n\n#### manifest_layers\n\nA manifest references a set of layers and the same layer may be referenced by several manifests (`N:N`).\n\nThe order of the layers must be guaranteed, so they must be inserted in this table in the correct order.

Currently this puts us at version `3.6.2` of the maven manager and at java `11`. Because the `maven` image name is unversioned, there is a risk that the image name might move in the future to point to a different version of java or maven (see [list](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven)).\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposal is to change the docker image to an explicitly versioned name. In this case to `maven:3.6.3-jdk-11`. That way users immediately know which version of maven and java they are working with and there is no risk of a surprise change.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] update the Dockerfile for `gemnasium-maven` with the new docker image\n- [x] tag this new version\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nn/a\n\n### Documentation\n\nn/a\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThe current downstream test project should continue to work as expected.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nEverything works as it did before the change.\n\n### Links /

smarter about auto-complete of @ mentions","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nIn an issue thread, when replying to a previous commenter, it's common to @ mention them. When a user starts typing `@`, we populate a list of auto-complete candidates. We're supposedly smart about prioritizing that list, but in practice, it fails often. Let's be smarter about populating that list. For example, prioritizing previous people in the same thread or issue.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nFor example, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/169, I'm replying to a specific person, and after typing the person's name, `Tom`, auto-complete doesn't even list the right Tom in the list, showing 5 other Toms instead.\n\nPresumably it's confused because the person's first name doesn't appear in their username at all, so if we're prioritizing usernames only, then we actually hide the relevant person. I suggest we should be looking at both display name and username when considering auto-complete responses.\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e09922ba965100d4a33f7c188029a5c3/image.png)\n\nIt's even weirder before I start typing as it shows some seemingly random people at the top of the list, with the last entry being the actual person I want to reach. How did we determine that list? It's got the second last commenter, but not the last commenter? Edit: Looks like those \"random\" people actually did participate in the thread. It's not all of them, and not even the first 5, but it skews towards the earlier commenters. Perhaps we could improve it by including the most recent commenters as that's more likely the target of a response? \n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/9cf2bee56d9d90cbda2f0f051d14ee93/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nSorting by most recent commenter would likely solve my needs at least. But I'd also say that once you start typing, you shouldn't then throw away that knowledge. The resulting filtered results should still be sorted by those recently participating in the issue, matching display name and username. \n\n1. [ ] Sort list by most-recent comment\n1. [ ] When typing, filter by display name as well as username\n1. [ ] When typing, keep sorting list by most-recent comment, followed by non-commenters\n1. [ ] Allow pagination of users in the event we aren't smart enough to show the right person in the top 5 results\n\nSide note, if you are going to limit to 5 entries, at least set the size of the popup to match all 5 entries. Showing a scrollbar just to see the last few pixels of the last entry is a waste, and also misleads the viewer into thinking there are more than 5 entries with the (misguided) hope that the entry they're looking for might be down there.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?
