Porting the same functionlity to GroupWiki and come in a seperate iteration.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nBackend REST endpoints are there so the experience can be ported without the need of the frontend.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] There's a feature flag available behind which the new Vue Wiki Edit/Create experience is reachable\n- [ ] The Vue implementation is at least on-par with the current one\n- [ ] VTU specs verifying the behavior of the wiki edit experience\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nExisting tests will need to be updated, please involve a SET in MR reviews.

trigger downstream container scanning test from klar MR","description":"## Summary\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to remove the [integration test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L9-29) for container scanning, and instead automatically trigger the downstream [container scanning test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/container-scanning) project to perform the integration test.\n\nThe downstream container scanning trigger was removed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/merge_requests/17/diffs?commit_id=fe9f55bdefcd161ee69b98d282fd286fd0b189c4) because of [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/merge_requests/17#note_263627576).  \n\nAs part of this issue, we may need to update the [Container-Scanning template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) to allow overriding the `klar image` to point to the temporary image created in the MR to validate the behaviour.\n\n## Improvements\n\nThis change will ensure that container scanning is consistent with other analyzers and test projects, and will also simplify code, since the integration test is currently duplicated in the [container scanning test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/container-scanning/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) as well as the [klar project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L9-29)\n\n## Involved components\n\n-

Also, if I press \"command\" and select an issue card it sometimes does not get selected until I click the left mouse button multiple times. This was brought to my attention by a customer who provided this feedback \"*Also, multi-selecting issues on the issue boards seems buggy at times (caused errors to be displayed). Could be browser related, but Steve saw errors in Chrome on Windows and I saw fewer issues in Safari on Mac. Something to look into perhaps*.\"\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nGo to an issue board with more than 2 issues in a column list, for example this issue board, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1417894?milestone_title=12.7\u0026\u0026label_name[]=devops%3A%3Arelease\u0026label_name[]=group%3A%3Arelease%20management and randomly start to select multiple (more than 3 or 4) issue cards using \"command\" then left mouse click. You will see that you may select a few cards, but they then get deselected upon selecting another card. \n\n### Example Project\n\nThis issue board exhibits the problem, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1417894?milestone_title=12.7\u0026\u0026label_name[]=devops%3A%3Arelease\u0026label_name[]=group%3A%3Arelease%20management as does other boards.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMulti-select is erratic allowing me to sometimes select issues cards and sometimes not. Sometimes you have to click the mouse multiple times to select a card when pressing the \"command' key.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nConsistency in selection of issue cards, where i only need to press the \"command\" key and click once for each card I wish to select.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Recording_2020-01-08_at_5.19.10_PM](/uploads/2f5a34cfc26d550e7ec6b0b1132245cc/Screen_Recording_2020-01-08_at_5.19.10_PM.mov)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-08T22:50:12.878Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:12:35.307Z","closed_at":"2020-02-21T08:13:02.975Z","closed_by":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","Community contribution","boards","devops::plan","frontend","group::project management","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAfter reading through all 4 of the related issues, it sounds like the root of the problems stem from either the lack of information or too much information being presented in the JIRA comments. \n\nIt looks like we already addressed the issue of *showing too much information* by making the comments optional in [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19004).\n\nI think that the most effective solution here would be to simply:\n\n1. Update the default comment template to include the `branch` name as mentioned in [Issue 17071](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/17071)\n2. Include an option that shows all information in the comment. (e.g. SHA, IDs, entire commit message) \n\nMy assumption is that by doing both updates 1 and 2 should satisfy the needs of the majority. Moving forward, we would like to validate the need for allowing a fully customizable comment template message. For now, in order to make progress, I think making updates 1 and 2 for now is a good start. \n\n#### UI update:\n![JIRA-comments-settings-v08](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/3d311af38889d63e16cd0c0192d044bf/JIRA-comments-settings-v08.png)\n\n\n:point_right: [**Clickable prototype**](https://www.figma.com/proto/zyCIMvSdS01YZUuMyOzI5B/195887-Jira-Comment-Design?node-id=168%3A783\u0026viewport=1403%2C335%2C0.5380300879478455\u0026scaling=min-zoom)\n\n\n**UI Copy:**\n\n`When a Jira issue is mentioned in a commit or merge request a remote link and comment (if enabled) will be created.`\n\n`Standard`\n\n`Includes username, project name, commit title and branch`\n\n`All details`\n\n`Includes Standard plus entire commit message, commit hash, and merge request`\n\n#### Comment types examples:\n| - | **Standard** | **All details** |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Commit | **John Smith** mentioned this issue in **a commit of gitlab/help-docs** on branch **staging**:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e 'This is an entire, very long commit message describing...' | **John Smith** mentioned this issue in a **commit 0a97e017** of **gitlab/help-docs** on branch **staging**:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e 'This is an entire, very long commit message describing what is being updated and the reasons for why it is being updated.' |\n| Merge request | **John Smith** mentioned this issue in **a merge request on gitlab/help-docs** on branch **staging**:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e 'This is an entire, very long commit message describing...' | **John Smith** mentioned this issue in **merge request !92203136** of **gitlab/help-docs** on branch **staging**:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e 'This is an entire, very long commit message describing what is being updated and the reasons for why it is being updated.' |\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

For this it probably doesn't make sense to change our global timeout configuration on GitLab.com because then read requests may hang for too long and this can impact availability.\n\n# Proposal\n\nOne possible option we have is to catch these timeout errors and retry with a smaller batch size or skip that batch. This is important because issue and merge request descriptions have no size limit and so we may always come across an issue or merge request that cannot be indexed but we don't want to just fail the whole project and index none of it. We should be able to skip things that cannot be indexed under the time limit.\n\nI think we should reduce batch size to `100,10,1` until we stop seeing timeouts and then if we still get timeouts at batch size of `1` we should be skipping that individual record that cannot be indexed. We will want to add careful logging to this whole process so it's easy to debug in future when certain things aren't being indexed.\n\n# Alternative proposal\n\nRather than retrying with smaller batch sizes to make our way through to the rest of the resources we may wish to just enqueue each batch as a separate job. Then those separate jobs can fail and it won't impact other resources. I believe we do something similar with background migrations in terms of enqueuing a range of IDs in batches.\n\nThat (as a first step) would already be valuable since we could get past the large issues and start indexing the merge requests (for example) but as a follow to that step we could have each of these batch jobs then catch any timeout exceptions and requeue themselves with smaller batches down to a single resource at which point we just rely on sidekiq retry limit to kill off any individual resource that cannot be indexed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-08T04:08:45.375Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T11:25:35.884Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T00:44:09.548Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"labels":["Category:Global Search","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","advanced search","devops::data_stores","group::global search","type::bug"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195774","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195774","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195774/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195774/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#195774","relative":"#195774","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#195774"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29389882,"iid":195770,"project_id":278964,"title":"Disallow blank or missing Graphql type descriptions","description":"In order for the GraphQL API docs to be even more usable for everyone, I propose a cop to ensure every type has a description.

The `users` table currently has 71 foreign key constraints, most of which have an `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` clause.  But a few of those constraints lack an `ON DELETE` action.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/191262 fixes one of those constraints (i.e. the `personal_access_tokens` table's reference to the `users` table).  There are 5 more tables that need similar treatment:\n\n```sql\n    TABLE \"protected_tag_create_access_levels\" CONSTRAINT \"fk_rails_2349b78b91\" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)\n    TABLE \"protected_branch_merge_access_levels\" CONSTRAINT \"fk_rails_5ffb4f3590\" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)\n    TABLE \"path_locks\" CONSTRAINT \"fk_rails_762cdcf942\" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)\n    TABLE \"protected_branch_push_access_levels\" CONSTRAINT \"fk_rails_8dcb712d65\" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)\n    TABLE \"u2f_registrations\" CONSTRAINT \"fk_rails_bfe6a84544\" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)\n```\n\nFor each of the above tables, decide whether it's more semantically appropriate to `CASCADE` the user deletion to those tables or instead to set the user_id field to null.\n\nAll of the above tables already have an index on their `user_id` field to efficiently support the constraint, so no new indexes are needed.\n\nIt is unfortunately not possible to alter the existing FK constraints; they must be replaced, which involves re-checking all rows in the constrained tables.  Doing so is slow and has locking consequences, so it may be desirable to include all of these FK constraint fixes in the same GitLab release.\n\nThe merge request for the above-mentioned issue (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22305) uses a two step procedure that somewhat reduces the potential for lock contention.  We should follow the same tactic for replacing these remaining 5 constraints.\n\n**However**, applying these migrations is very likely to cause lock contention (at least briefly) several times.  We should probably mention that in the release notes.  Adding the new constraint and dropping the old constraint both require an AccessExclusive lock on the `users` table, which will block (and be blocked by) even just ordinary read-only queries against that table.  The `users` table is very frequently accessed, so lock contention is very likely; how long that contention lasts will determine the degree of impact to GitLab availability.  Applying the migration does not necessarily require downtime, but depending on workload, it can cause potentially severe lock contention which effectively equates to unplanned downtime.  We should advise applying these migrations during a period of low activity or a planned maintenance window if possible.\n\nFor reference, here are the current row counts for those tables in the gitlab.com database, as a rough indicator of relatively how much work the db must do to revalidate the replacement constraints.  Other GitLab instances will, of course, have different sizes based on usage patterns.\n\n```sql\n              table_name              | num_rows \n--------------------------------------+----------\n

to solve\n\nWhen users authenticate over SSH with [Fast SSH lookups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.html#fast-lookup-of-authorized-ssh-keys-in-the-database) enabled, gitlab-shell sends the entire base64-encoded SSH public key to the `/api/internal/authorized_keys` endpoint of GitLab. From there, we generate an *MD5* fingerprint and use it to look up an SSH key that it matches.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\nMD5 collisions are not too expensive to generate, so this is something of a security risk. It's likely to fail us in FIPS audits too, since MD5 is banned in that context.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19860 we started generating SHA256 fingerprints for keys. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21579 we introduced a background migration that sets a SHA256 fingerprint for all keys. This means that we could start looking up by SHA256 fingerprint instead.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSince gitlab-shell sends us the whole public key, not just the fingerprint, gitlab already has all the information it needs to calculate the sha256 fingerprint of that key and do a lookup based on that information, rather than on the MD5 fingerprint.

When a branch has been pushed to, it will also run `BranchHooksService#execute`, as described in the complicated call stack at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30883.\n\nIn a couple of recent cases on GitLab.com's production site (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/1536, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/on-call-handovers/issues/214), we saw this queue back up. The cause of the backing up appears to have been that some of the jobs in the queue were taking too long, and also taking a lot of CPU time. (CPU time is a problem because of Ruby's global interpreter lock: executing Ruby code in one thread will prevent other threads from executing Ruby code.)\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe same issue has been opened (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/196966) with more information, which identifies a second problem.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n#### Note that this may not resolve the problem identified in #196966 ([see here for more information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/196966#note_272107414)).\n\nI think that we should reduce the CPU and Gitaly usage of `Git::BranchHooksService#commits` by creating two new Gitaly RPCs (or extending existing ones):\n\n1. Gets the last N (here, 100) commits between two revisions.\n2. Counts the total number of commits between two revisions.\n\nCurrently we are combining these two operations, which means we fetch an unbounded set of commits from Gitaly, count them, and throw away all but the last 100. In addition to being potentially slower on the Gitaly side, this is also very slow on the Rails side of the equation.\n\n## Detailed explanation\n\nThe main problem in both of these cases appears to have been pushes that take a very long time to process. In particular, they spent a long time in `Git::BranchHooksService#enqueue_process_commit_messages` -\u003e `Git::BaseHooksService#limited_commits` -\u003e `Git::BranchHooksService#commits` -\u003e `Repository#commits_between`\n\nOur intent in this service is to get:\n\n1. At most 100 commits from the push. (100 is `Git::BaseHooksService::PROCESS_COMMIT_LIMIT`.)\n2. The total number of commits from the push.\n\nHowever, [`Git::BranchHooksService#commits`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.0-ee/app/services/git/branch_hooks_service.rb#L19-36) has varying behaviour:\n\n1. If we're creating the default branch, we only fetch the last 100 commits from the push. (And [override `#commits_count`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.0-ee/app/services/git/branch_hooks_service.rb#L38-42) to make the count correct.)\n2. If we're creating any other branch, we fetch all the commits that diverge between this branch and the default branch.\n3. If we're updating any branch, we do the same as 2, but compare the current state of this branch to the previous state.\n4. If we're deleting a branch, we do nothing because we didn't receive any commits.\n\nCase 2 is the big problem here (and potentially case 3 as well, although it's less likely). When the pushed branch diverges significantly from the default branch, we can end up with a lot of commits. We will then:\n\n1. Fetch all those commits from Gitaly.\n2. Decorate them in Ruby (convert to a different object type) in [`Repository#commits_between`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/v12.6.0-ee/app/models/repository.rb#L167-171).\n3. Take the count for `#commits_count`.\n4. In `#limited_commits` we throw away all but the last 100.\n\nThis can be really slow and block other jobs from executing! The decoration itself takes a noticeable amount of CPU time. Here's a real case from production where there were 54,000 commits between two branches:\n\n```ruby\nmirror = Project.find(3121189)\nBenchmark.bm do |x|\n  x.report('decorated') { mirror.repository.commits_between('1e9e926c4d15483460bc04a7760078ad2fbce39d', '1b612917e370f4fa6cbcbc8438b0461ff79a4357') }\n  x.report('raw') { Gitlab::Git::Commit.between(mirror.repository.raw_repository, '1e9e926c4d15483460bc04a7760078ad2fbce39d', '1b612917e370f4fa6cbcbc8438b0461ff79a4357') }\nend\n```\n\nThis prints:\n\n```\n           user       system      total        real\ndecorated  6.560000   0.260000   6.820000 (  8.235514)\nraw        5.604000   0.144000   5.748000 (  6.447340)\n```\n\nWhich is a full extra second of CPU time just for this job, under non-resource-constrained conditions. And most of that work is unnecessary, as discussed above.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-07T15:18:15.322Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T13:57:33.893Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T11:26:47.219Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Background Processing","Category:Gitaly","Deliverable","Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","backend","bug::performance","devops::create","group::source code","infradev","missed-deliverable","missed:13.10","missed:13.11","missed:13.6","missed:13.7","missed:13.8","missed:13.9","missed:14.2","priority::3","repository","section::dev","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195667","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195667","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195667/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195667/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#195667","relative":"#195667","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#195667"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6523,"epic":{"id":321041,"iid":6523,"title":"Engineering Allocation (Source Code BE): 02-AUG-2021","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6523","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29374022,"iid":195664,"project_id":278964,"title":"Bypass accepting terms for deleting own account","description":"**[HackerOne report #768297](https://hackerone.com/reports/768297)** by `nsauk` on 2020-01-05, assigned to @jeremymatos:\n\n### Summary\n\nUser doesn't accept ToS before signing up via external provider (e.g. Github).

This way, for testing purposes, we can enable the feature flag on the project `gitlab-org/gitlab` for example, instead of enabling it globally.\n\nThis issue focuses on updating the views in order to use the snippet repository content","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-07T11:13:40.301Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T07:07:54.155Z","closed_at":"2020-02-25T10:48:48.139Z","closed_by":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","Deliverable","backend","devops::create","direction","group::editor","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"}],"author":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195517","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195517","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195517/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/195517/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#195517","relative":"#195517","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#195517"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":239,"epic":{"id":470,"iid":239,"title":"Version control for snippets","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/239","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29364584,"iid":195513,"project_id":278964,"title":"Uniqueness constraint missing in the Release model","description":"It is possible to have the same tag (eg. `v1.2`) for two or more releases associated to the same project. \n\nThis situation occurred over multiple projects on `gitlab.com`.

This would hopefully remove the need for the non-reactive `actions` array managed by the `header_component`.\n\n## Context\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/21365#note_267259849\n\n\u003e The actions are structured in a semi-generic way, while only being used in one place. This feels quite over-engineered.\n\n/cc @fh1ch","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-06T16:47:10.289Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T22:10:32.402Z","closed_at":"2020-01-29T20:54:07.800Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","maintenance::refactor"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This functionality is restricted to those users which have been granted access to a project and hold at least the `Reporter` role, or those users that have created the issue.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nA user creates an issue on a program and assigns by mistake the issue to our attacker account. The attacker will receive a notification, as he has been assigned to a new issue on a particular program.\n\nThe attacker could then craft a GraphQL mutation on the `issueSetConfidential` object and change the `confidentiality` attribute from `false` to `true`. This will have an immediate effect on the issue, hiding it from the rest of users holding the `Guest` role.\n\n### Impact\n\nAs detailed above, an attacker with no role or permissions on a group that has created a project could hide issues from other users.\n\n\n\nI'm completely aware of the likelihood of this scenario from happening, however I've not been able to exercise this functionality from the web interface nor the API. Hence why I believe this behavior is not intended and should not happen. Specially if the user performing this attack does not belong to the group that has created the project.\n\n\n\n### Example\n\nFor this scenario lets gonna use two different accounts:\n\n* `victim@gitlab.com`  \n* `attacker@gitlab.com`\n\nAs `victim@gitlab.com` lets create a new issue on a public project where we participate:\n\n![Issue_-_Created.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/0d4059ce-bfa7-490d-879c-dcd52c477394/Issue_-_Created.png)\n\nAs the `attacker@gitlab.com`, if we attempt to access the issue, we will be presented with only the ability to write new comments:\n\n![Issue_-_Attacker_perspective.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/a23135db-cce7-4ebc-8cbf-6703a738591f/Issue_-_Attacker_perspective.png)\n\nIf attacker attempts to perform the mutation GraphQL query mentioned above, the following response will be returned:\n\n**GraphQL Query**\n\n```  \nmutation {  \n  issueSetConfidential(input:{projectPath:\"groupID/projectID\", iid:\"5\", confidential:true}){  \n    errors  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\n\n\n**GraphQL Response**\n\n```  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"issueSetConfidential\": null  \n  },  \n  \"errors\": [  \n    {  \n      \"message\": \"The resource that you are attempting to access does not exist or you don't have permission to perform this action\",  \n      \"locations\": [  \n        {  \n          \"line\": 2,  \n          \"column\": 3  \n        }  \n      ],  \n      \"path\": [  \n        \"issueSetConfidential\"  \n      ]  \n    }  \n  ]  \n}\n```\n\n\n\nWe will get back later to this, for now lets focus again on our `victim@gitlab.com`. As we have decided to assign the recently created issue to a new user, which in this case will be our `attacker@gitlab.com` (Either by mistake or on purpose):\n\n*Note* : In this case I'm going to use the quick action `/assign [@]username` as I cannot assign external users that do not belong to a project using the web interface (I'm not sure if this is kind of expected, but thought would be worth to be brought to your attention)\n\n\n\n![Issue_-_Attacker_Assigned.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7ba378e6-e1c1-490a-a16e-147ebfec395d/Issue_-_Attacker_Assigned.png)\n\n\n\nRight after doing this, the `attacker@gitlab.com` will receive a new notification on the UI, as shown below:\n\n![Issue_-_Attacker_Notification.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/f5d0c67a-cc2e-45a8-b447-f32fd05a4f1e/Issue_-_Attacker_Notification.png)\n\nAfter visiting the new issue as the `attacker@gitlab.com` we can observe two things:\n\n* There is no user assigned to the issue  \n* There is no option to change the `confidentiality` attribute through the web interface.\n\n![Issue_-_Attacker_perspective.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/a23135db-cce7-4ebc-8cbf-6703a738591f/Issue_-_Attacker_perspective.png)\n\nHowever, if we repeat the same GraphQL mutation query mentioned above, we will receive a different response this time:\n\n\n**GraphQL Request**\n\n```  \nmutation {  \n  issueSetConfidential(input:{projectPath:\"groupID/projectID\", iid:\"5\", confidential:true}){  \n    errors  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\n**GraphQL Response**\n\n```  \n{\n  \"data\": {  \n    \"issueSetConfidential\": {  \n      \"errors\": []  \n    }  \n  }  \n}\n```\n\nIf we check the issue activity, we will observe the following message:\n\n![Issue_-_Changed_by_attacker.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b404dd0e-580c-4f8a-8e45-8ba2c7aa785c/Issue_-_Changed_by_attacker.png)\n\nOur `attacker@gitlab.com` has been able to successfully change the `confidential` attribute for a finding, when this functionality was not being offered in first place through the web interface.\n\nAdditionally, if we open a new anonymous session and navigate to the issues page for this project, we will see that the issue is \"gone\".\n\n![Issue_-_Anonymous_Window.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/7139000b-408a-4e54-ba36-7f08e58fdb7a/Issue_-_Anonymous_Window.png)\n\n\n### What's the current bug behaviour?\n\nChanging `confidentiality` attributes on findings through a mutation GraphQL query should not be possible if such functionality is not offered neither through the web interface, nor the GitLab API.\n\nThis may allow an attacker without any special role nor privileges to arbitrarily change the confidentiality of those issues for which he/she has been assigned to. Revoking visibiility to uses with `Guest` or no role at all.\n\n\n\n### What's the expected correct behaviour?\n\nI would expect this action to not be possible from being executed as such functionality/behaviour is not present within the GitLab web interface nor GitLab API.\n\nAs a user with no privileges nor member of a group where the affected project belongs to, I would expect two things:\n\n- Not being able to get any issues assigned as I'm not involve nor belongs to the project's group.  \n- Not being able to arbitrarily set the confidentiality attribute of an issue for which I've been assigned to, specially if I don't have enough permissions for such action.\n\n## Impact\n\nPlease see the description provided above\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to successfully run a GitHub action or Circle CI orb from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.\n\nSteps of the POC:\n\n* Decide which method is easier and more compatible with `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n* Select an action/orb with intermediate complexity (transferring parameters)\n* Successfully running the action/orb directly to/from AWS\n* Create documentation of what is needed in order to use actions/orbs from the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, including which environment variables and secrets\n\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

In issue #16043, a suggestion was raised to allow for `tags` to be set globally, or configured as default options (which the resulting MR eventually settled on).\n\nWhen using `tags` as a [default parameter](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.6/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#setting-default-parameters), the value does not inherit to jobs that do not explicitly specify the tag to use.  Is this working as intended?  If so, the documentation should be updated to clarify that the default `tags` will not be inherited by jobs.\n\nThe workaround is to explicitly define `tags` for each job, or to use job templates as was [mentioned in the original issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/16043#note_214880062) that lead to the merge request.\n\nThis functionality was added in !20747.\n\nPremium customer facing this problem: [ticket 142554](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/142554) (internal).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHave a runner configured to only accept tagged jobs with `docker-dind` as the tag.\n\nA sample CI:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  tags: ['docker-dind']\n\njob1:\n  tags: ['docker-dind']\n  script: echo \"explicit tags\"\n  \njob2:\n  script: echo \"inherit tags\"\n```\n\n`job1` runs as expected; `job2` holds indefinitely waiting for a runner.  It is marked as \"stuck\" in the UI.\n\n### Example Project\n\nI have a quick demo of project on GitLab.com using a specified runner, configured to only accept tagged jobs: https://gitlab.com/kevenhughes/default-tags\n\n[specific runner NqziYn6g](https://gitlab.com/kevenhughes/default-tags/runners/1434386), available tags are `cluster` and `kubernetes`.\n\n[CI has two jobs](https://gitlab.com/kevenhughes/default-tags/blob/1894e793cbd0edbbeed2931a280ae8aadf588dda/.gitlab-ci.yml), one which explicitly defines a tag, and one which relies on `default` to inherit a tag.\n\nThe resulting pipeline, wherein job1 succeeds but job2 sits on hold indefinitely due to being untagged.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/kevenhughes/default-tags/pipelines/106902940/builds\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nCI config `default:tags` is not inherit by jobs which don't otherwise specify a list of tags.  If this isn't a bug, but is working correctly by design, the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.6/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#setting-default-parameters) should be clarified.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAs a default config, it should be applied to jobs without an explicit definition of tags.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nMy original thought was that `tags` is not set to `inherit: true` in [lib/gitlab/ci/config/entry/default.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/cf39803b81f23cf2eba6eb5a7e653862ed92a63c/lib/gitlab/ci/config/entry/default.rb#L56-58)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T18:58:39.900Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T21:13:39.550Z","closed_at":"2022-06-14T21:13:39.531Z","closed_by":{"id":9468400,"username":"marknuzzo","name":"Mark Nuzzo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9468400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marknuzzo"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","candidate::15.3","customer","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","priority::3","section::ops","severity::3","type::bug","vintage","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
