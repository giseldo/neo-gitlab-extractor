My eye keeps bouncing back to the green icon instead of reading the text more closely.”\n1. “Can everything successful be grouped under one icon in some way?”\n\n![image](/uploads/b66eabebdd6f41fa1d930e5231348533/image.png)\n\n#### Part 2\nIn the merge request widget for **code tests**, there's no visual difference between the widget's header and its expanded content.\n\n![image](/uploads/ba9b7574ff7ac304e94ce38b1544a17e/image.png)\n\n### Why\n\nWith too much emphasis on the status icons, especially due to duplicated icons, it's difficult for users to focus on the text and differences between each test result.\n\n### How \n\n#### Part 1\n\nSee how it's possible to de-emphasize the test results icons. One option is to group results by status, instead of duplicating the status icons for each result.\n\n#### Part 2\n\nVisually differentiate the MR widget header from the expanded content.\n\n**[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/2xyEtC1JM1ClKGNhpTcZXR/Testing-coverage-widget?node-id=414%3A208)** Note that these are the same designs uploaded to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/283894\n\n[insight1]: https://dovetailapp.com/projects/14109fbc-dfdd-4204-a54e-9c80ba8b7bba/insights/cddfa05e-61a9-4aea-9363-b417758c483a\n\n[insight2]: https://dovetailapp.com/projects/14109fbc-dfdd-4204-a54e-9c80ba8b7bba/insights/a93aa597-cabf-414b-9d95-ddef414b3303\n\n\n* The `child` test results should indent using a left padding of `32px`.\n* The `child` results item container should have its height reduced to `10px 8px`.\n* The status icon in the `child` container should have its dimensions reduced to `16px`.\n* If a child container displays a warning state, the background color should be `$gray-50` - the same as the scrollable container.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-14T11:16:41.595Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T21:10:18.486Z","closed_at":"2021-03-02T21:54:12.225Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","SUS::FY22 Q1 - Done","UI polish","UX","closed::complete","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline insights","merge request widget","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"}],"author":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293655","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293655","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293655/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293655/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#293655","relative":"#293655","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#293655"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":76024916,"iid":293651,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Import requirements via CSV upload\"","description":"The following discussion from !47064 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @allison.browne started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47064#note_465317437): \n\n    \u003e Just noting that we should probably have a method in a service rather than calling the worker directly in the controller per our [abstraction guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/reusing_abstractions.html#abstractions).

This is documented for `only:changes` in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#using-onlychanges-without-pipelines-for-merge-requests, and I've validated that it applies to `rules:changes` as well. The stated reason for this is:\n\n\u003e In this case, a previous SHA is used to calculate the diff, which is equivalent to git diff HEAD~\n\nI don't understand how that explanation fits, though. I could easily be wrong, but can't we implement this feature as follows:\n\nFor any commit that has 1 parent, as is common with new-branch commits that are not usually new root branches in most project workflows, `git diff HEAD~` shows the contents of HEAD, and we should be able to base changes rules on that.\n\nIn the general case, can we not calculate diffs using something like (pseudocode):\n\n```\n# This returns a list of commits, starting with the SHA of HEAD, and then each of its parents\nfor each commit in `git rev-list --parents -n1 HEAD`\n  `git diff $SHA..HEAD --name-only`\n```\n\nIf files are included in the diff of HEAD with any of its parents, then they can be considered to have changed for CI purposes. This should work for merge commits, and should even support octopus merges (\u003e2 parents) for free.\n\nFixing this bug would provide a lot of value for monorepo-style repos in which many independent jobs could be run, but it's desirable to limit the number of jobs that do run. For example, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/tanka-deployments deploys several different things, and attempts to use rules:changes to limit what runs. We do want to produce deployment diffs from branch commits though, and end up doing this for everything on new branches due to this bug, which is rather expensive.\n\nUsing a more general diff strategy like this might benefit other parts of GitLab. Removing coupling between order of parents in a merge commit and other parts of the system might have prevented minor regressions such as not showing diffs for merge commits, which was fixed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/merge_requests/2868.\n\n\n\n### Proposal\n:warning: There is an ongoing discussion about the proposed solution, see more info in the following [thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293645#note_908057543).   \nThe proposed solution based on the comment below will allow solving this problem branch pipelines (without using merge request pipelines, proving users to explicitly define which branch we should compare to\n\n\n\n```yaml\ntest:\n  script: ./run tests\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH\n      changes:\n        paths:\n          - my/monorepo/project\n        compare_to:\n          branch: master\n          tag: v1.0 # out of scope for MVC\n          sha: abcd1234 # Out of scope for MVC\n  ```\n\n:rotating_light: **NOTE:**  In the above example, it would be a compare of `branch` OR `tag` OR `sha` but NOT all 3.\n\n\n## Implementation Table\n\n\u003c!--\n_NOTE: If the issue is not part of an epic, the implementation table can be removed.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a user getting started with pages, I would like to find examples that I can start using immediately instead of searching through the pages documentation and trying to find this myself.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to locate pages easily and able to deploy their pages environments with minimal clicks\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nToday when a user selects pages under settings before pages are configured, there is the following helper text: `Learn how to upload your static site and have it served by GitLab by following the documentation on GitLab Pages.`\n\nWe could make the user's like a bit easier by also supplying the link to GitLab pages examples: \nhttps://gitlab.com/pages \n\n![image](/uploads/9ae5b7f77da290ff11dfed4dba687b03/image.png)\n\nSo new helper text would be:\n\nSee the [GitLab Pages documentation](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/pages/index.md) to learn how to upload your static site and have it served by GitLab. You can also follow a [sample project](https://gitlab.com/pages) or use a [GitLab CI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates).\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nWhat this looks like today (before configuration of pages):\n\n![image](/uploads/f9b2b640276061a7083eb3252e3c17cf/image.png)\n\n\nWhat this looks like today (after configuration of pages):\n\n![image](/uploads/c5863e15b9f72ddde98390c65e6252fc/image.png)\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

/\u003e\n\n### Cause\n\n`Show whitespace changes` uses an `input` and a `label` element. All labels are assigned a heavier `font-weight`.  \n`Show one file at a time` uses `GlFormCheckbox`, which does not have the heavier weight for its `label`.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe `Show whitespace changes` checkbox should be updated to a `GlFormCheckbox`.\n\n### Known complexity\n\nThe way this dropdown is tested causes some issues with testing. Switching to the encapsulated `GlFormCheckbox` component and triggering a click there circumvents the stubbed Vuex actions in the tests and triggers the real action, leading to lots of code running that shouldn't.

Investigation: Codequality template job on gitlab.com shared runners is slow","description":"### Summary\n\nIn a technical investigation of CodeQuality execution time, we produced a runner configuration solution that works well for customers who host their own runners, whether they use self-hosted or SaaS GitLab. Because the runner configuration required is different than that permissible on the gitlab.com shared runners, the solution doesn't work for all customers.\n\nWe should consider another change that would help to speed up CodeQuality execution on our own shared runners. The savings via runner configuration are [dramatic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267930#note_463506845), so any similar improvement here has the potential to produce meaningful cost savings.\n\nWe should investigate what we can do with the dependency proxy on GitLab dot com, including interacting with ~\"group::package\" and ~\"Engineering Productivity\" to get their feedback on how we can best proceed to speed up CodeQuality and also reduce our hits to the Dockerhub repository, as in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/283929.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nInclude the CodeQuality template in a project CI pipeline. gitlab-org/gitlab for example.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAn analysis that should take less than a minute takes over twenty minutes, because it has to fetch several docker images.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nA CodeQuality job execute in under 5 minutes. (@drewcimino made up this goal with no real basis)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nWe got this far with private runners. Inspiring stuff!\n\n![image](/uploads/48ed287f967191ec19cc5e259674788e/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe believe a read-through cache would achieve significant time savings.

first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWhile issue type \"detail pages\" are subtly different, the headers are essentially the same. We also don't differentiate between issue types on the issue list, or on boards. So, in those contexts, there's currently no visual indication that someone is looking at different issue types. How can we help people more quickly understand which issue type they are looking at?\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\nAllow people to quickly distinguish different issue types, visually. Especially in those contexts where multiple issue types will appear simultaneously, for example, on issue lists and boards.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nBegin associating icons with particular issue types:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-02-04_at_11.13.51_AM](/uploads/86a04db5033361486ea8527f1a7fdd75/Screen_Shot_2021-02-04_at_11.13.51_AM.png)\n\nThese icons would start showing up in the issue type headers, on issue lists, and on boards:\n\n| Issue type headers | Issue types on the issue lists | Issue types on boards |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Headers](/uploads/8e44c70cf02274e2ae215d9f899bb92d/Headers.png) | ![Frame_208](/uploads/19e24ded70d427406bb0b4da763d4115/Frame_208.png)| ![Boards](/uploads/78a8f138fec231c90838b419ad4d6800/Boards.png)|\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!--  Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.\nRead the

finds vulnerabilities (as intended). This folder should be ignored when scanning the project.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun dependency scanning on the `gemnasium` project.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNo error reported.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-10_at_15.13.47](/uploads/a1d9c2c9c0d36b0aeba00756dff1894b/Screen_Shot_2020-12-10_at_15.13.47.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nAdd  `testdata` to `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`, either in the [project CI config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L7) or in the [CI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml). This depends https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292457.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Add `testdata` and `fixtures` to `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`, either in the [CI config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) or in the [CI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) if this is generic enough.\n- [x] Remove `SEARCH_IGNORED_DIRS` from [CI config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/.gitlab-ci.yml#L7). This is no longer needed.\n- [x] Drop the [`before_script`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.9/.gitlab-ci.yml#L53) that deletes all files in the `fixtures` and `testdata` directories\n\n### Testing\n\nChange will be implicitly tested by Gemnasium test pipeline, test projects","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-10T20:17:03.588Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:47:15.341Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T17:20:59.739Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::pipelines","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":19,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292813","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292813","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292813/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292813/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#292813","relative":"#292813","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#292813"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2725,"epic":{"id":23576,"iid":2725,"title":"Dependency Scanning - Complete to Loveable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2725","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75919837,"iid":292811,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve SAML Timeout Experience","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. \n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nWe implemented the [7-day timeout for SAML groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217367) for GitLab.com which requires users to re-auth into their SAML provider. This requires users to click to trigger a SAML log-in to check if they still have access to their IdP. This isn't the best user experience.\n\n![image](/uploads/b14631bde4602df2f30801968628f9be/image.png)\n\n### Proposal \n\nWe should improve this experience by making a request out to the SAML provider when the 7-day limit has expired and not require a user click to do so. This is a common pattern used in other enterprise applications.\n\n\n\n\u003c!-- Read the labels descriptions on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels to find the appropriate labels. Consider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

handled by the middleware, which ultimately causes a `500 Internal Server Error` response.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`$ go get` with a user where the 2-factor authentication is enabled.\n\n**Note**: From trying to reproduce the issue, the error only happens if when sending the password, the GitLab account password is used instead of a personal access token. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nReturn a `500 Internal Server Error`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nReturn a `401 Unauthorized`.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n*

update status of vulnerabilities in Vulnerability Reports","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps. They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n## Release Notes\n\nIt is currently possible to select and bulk dismiss multiple vulnerabilities from a Vulnerability Report. This is helpful in quickly removing redundant occurrences or false positive. However, you must still open up individual vulnerability details to change status to anything other than Dismissed. This is inefficient for doing routine activities such as resolving all vulnerabilities no longer detected by securing scanners.\n\nThis bulk actions enhancement addresses this limitation. Selecting one or more vulnerabilities from a Vulnerability Report will now present the option to set any status. You can even move vulnerabilities back to Detected if they need further triage evaluation. Combined with the filtering capabilities, it is easier than ever to isolate and take action on a specific subset of vulnerabilities all at once.\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nIt is currently possible to select and bulk Dismiss multiple vulnerabilities from a Vulnerability Report. This is helpful in quickly removing redundant occurrences or false positive. However, you must still open up individual vulnerability details to change status to anything other than Dismissed. This enhancement makes it possible to bulk update vulnerabilities to any status.\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227284)\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated. The plan can also\ncall-out responsibilities for other team members or teams.\n--\u003e\n\n- [x] ~frontend As of today, the `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/selection_summary.vue` already allows the user to select multiple vulnerabilities and dismiss them. We have to extend this functionality, and allow the user to change the status of the bulk selection instead of allowing only to dismiss them. We can probably reuse the same component that will be created https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285470 for changing the status. Then we'll need to create an input so that the user can specify the Reason and implement the buttons. Clicking on the button should trigger a confirm modal and we should commit the action only when the user confirms the modal.  \n\n- [ ] ~~For the reason box, the ~backend is going to accept either `comment` or `dismissal_reason` as an argument. I'd personally prefer `dismissal_reason` more as it's more descriptive.

But, when you've used the [Packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#list-packages) to list packages, you may have noticed that the job token does not work. This is problematic if you are trying to list existing packages in your registry so as to avoid creating and uploading duplicate packages. \n\nMoving forward, the Packages API will support authenticating with the `CI_JOB_TOKEN`. Hopefully, this helps streamline your CI workflows and makes your life a little easier. \n\n### Problem to solve \nAs a Developer, I would like to list packages using the `CI_JOB_TOKEN`, so that I can understand which packages are in my project's registry and avoid uploading duplicate name/versions. It is already possible with a normal API token. Trying to do this with `CI_JOB_TOKEN` results in 401 error.\n\n\n### Proposal \nThe Packages API will support authentication using the job token. This will allow users to use the token as expected. \n\nThere are actually two endpoints that list packages:\n\n1. [Within a project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#within-a-project) (support is being added via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91437)\n1.

Such as [listing package files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#list-package-files), [deleting a package](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#delete-a-project-package)?

In the face of these potentially large data processing demands, ~\"group::optimize\" chose to implement a once-per-month update to minimize the ongoing cost (data processing time) and risk (performance degradation and query timeouts) involved with calculating the data for each segment.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDevOps Adoption data should continue to have a timeframe of \"calendar months\", but the current month's data should be updated daily.\n\n### Related links\n\n- This issue was prompted by [a discussion in another issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271250#note_463312385).","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-09T17:04:59.251Z","updated_at":"2021-04-30T09:54:38.546Z","closed_at":"2021-01-21T09:47:59.757Z","closed_by":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","group::optimize","priority::1","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"}],"author":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3482158,"username":"pshutsin","name":"Pavel Shutsin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3482158/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pshutsin"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292516","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292516","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292516/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292516/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#292516","relative":"#292516","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#292516"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75845221,"iid":292515,"project_id":278964,"title":"Toggling file-by-file mode on an MR will cause links to diffs force the file-by-file on users who follow those links","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\nWe recently rolled out a feature (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233898) and one aspect generated some discussion within the Frontend folks of Code Review.\n\nOpening this issue to discuss this widely and see if we're comfortable with this approach or if we should revisit this detail.\n\nWhen the user toggles the mode, `?fileViewMode=single` or `?fileViewMode=all` gets appended to the URL.\n\nAfter that, if users copy a link to a diff file or line number, this parameter will be carried in that URL. \n\nExample: [Link to a line number](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49298/diffs?fileViewMode=single#5ad64ff6455e7343b07e410069f79f65d801255a_2_1)\n\nThis essentially forces a user-preference on whoever follows that link.\n\nThis implementation detail is optional.

Create an Ultimate subscription \n2. Add some users\n3. Set some of them as Guests\n4. Create GitLab generated bots (ex: [Support Bot](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk.html#support-bot-user), [Project bot](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#project-bot-users))\n5. Block some users\n6. Check the number of `Billable Users` on Admin\u003eDashboard, Admin\u003eLicense, Admin\u003eDashboard\u003eUsers Statistics \n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIn the Admin Dashboard and License page the number of `Billable Users` doesn't match the number of `Billable Users` displayed on the Users Statistics page. After testing, it is determined that the value displayed on the Users Statistics page is incorrectly counting GitLab generated Bots, Guest users (Ultimate) and users without projects or groups (Ultimate) as billable users.\n\n### Additional questions to answer/verify during investigation\n\n1. When a trial license is loaded, are Guest users counted in the Billable Users count?\n1. When users are added during the trial, is the daily [active user count](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/models/historical_data.rb#L15) recorded and later referenced by the [max historical count](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/models/historical_data.rb#L30)?\n1. When the customer ran gitlab-rails runner 'User.all.each { |u| puts u.username unless !u.using_license_seat? }' | wc -l they get 60 users (UI shows 80).

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nVariable DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS behaviour changed to pre-filter\n\nFor users of the Depedency Scanning variable DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS we are introducing a breaking change, it will now pre-filter. This change applied to all versions asthe change is being backported. December 22, 2021 forward gemnasium considers DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS when searching for supported projects and will pre-filter out those that match. Pre-filtering prevents the analyzer from logging warning or failing when processing dependency files that have been explicitly excluded using DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS.\n\nYou should not need to take any action, however if you were expecting this post-filtering behaviour you will no longer have this data available to you in logs or artifacts.\n\nThe previous behaviour was causing failures and unexpected errors for users and after discussions we found that this, pre-filter as opposed to post filter,  was the more expected and desired behaviour.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-dependency-scanning\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nGemnasium can be configure to filter specific files and directories using the `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variable, but this is implemented as a post-filter, which causes issues:\n- when the excluded build file, dependency file, or lock file can't be processed\n- when the analyzer only scans one file/directory, and it automatically picks up the one being excluded\n\nThe workaround is to remove the files being excluded prior to the scan, in the `before_script` of the scanning job.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n\n### Proposal \n\nMake Gemnasium consider `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` when searching for supported projects, and skip files that match this CI file (pre-filtering). Pre-filtering would prevent the analyzer from logging warning or even failing when processing dependency files that have been explicitly excluded using `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`.\n\n### Further details\n\nGemnasium relies on the `pathfilter` package of the [common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) library to set up a path filter based on the CLI options. After the scan, this filter is passed to `Report.ExcludePaths` (`report` package) to remove excluded files from vulnerabilities and dependency files.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Update gemnasium https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/217\n   - Make its `finder` use `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`, and add unit tests\n   - Change existing image test for `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`, and introduce a broken file to prove that it's skipped (no parsing error)\n- [x] Update gemnasium-python\n   - Update dependencies: `gemnasium` module\n   - Change `main.go` similar to what's been done in `gemnasium` project\n   - Add image test for `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` (using broken `requirements.txt`) if image tests are available; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333829\n- [x] Update gemnasium-maven\n   - Port the changes to `gemnasium-python`.\n   - Also skip extra files returned by the builders, if they match `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change\n\n### Documentation\n\nTBD. See [discussion](#note_740641019).\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n`DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` is already tested in the context of `gemnasium` but there's no distinction b/w pre-filter and post-filtering, so we need an image test where a broken file is skipped, and the scan is successful.\n\nThis should be ported to gemnasium-maven and gemnasium-python (with broken dep. file or broken build file) once they have image integration tests. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333829.\n\n### Available Tier\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers no longer need a workaround to skip files that they don't want to scan, in particular in the context of gemnasium-maven and gemnasium-python since these only scan a single project.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-09T10:57:44.987Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T07:30:31.541Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T07:47:01.091Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Technical Writing","backend","breaking change","bug::performance","customer","devops::secure","documentation","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","priority::2","quad-planning::complete-action","release post item","release post item::in review","section::sec","tw-weight::3","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292457","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292457","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292457/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292457/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#292457","relative":"#292457","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#292457"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6558,"epic":{"id":325256,"iid":6558,"title":"Reduce the number Dependency Scanning CI jobs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6558","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":75817364,"iid":292445,"project_id":278964,"title":"Invalid CI minutes quota can be displayed for nested groups","description":"## Problem\n\nDuring the [refactoring of CI Minutes quota](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49009#note_460212193) we found out that we might show `namespaces/_shared_runner_status.html.haml` for namespaces that are not root namespaces.\n\nThis partial uses `CI::Minutes::Quota` to show usage data for the given namespace.\n\nThe [condition we use](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d5edc1b6b219b62712471175e383ff4f28fbdee6/ee/app/views/namespaces/_shared_runner_status.html.haml#L4) to avoid displaying the partial does not guard against non-root namespaces:\n\n```ruby\n- if namespace.any_project_with_shared_runners_enabled?\n```\n\nIn case of non-root namespace we would show invalid data because `Ci::Minutes::Quota` would return an [\"Unlimited\" quota report if the namespace is not a root namespace](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d5edc1b6b219b62712471175e383ff4f28fbdee6/ee/app/models/ci/minutes/quota.rb#L22).

`AuthorizedProjectsWorker` to use database replica for reads","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292242, we investigate improving the read workload coming from he `AuthorizedProjectsWorker`. This worker has two phases:\n\n1. Read: Calculate \"fresh\" permissions for the user\n1. Write: In a transaction, remove full set of old permissions and insert full set of new ones\n\nsidekiq jobs generally don't use read-only load balancing. This issue is about allowing this worker to perform its reads from replicas (if we can) - which offloads the heavy query from the primary.\n\nThis is a specific example worker for the broader topic discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/566.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-09T08:45:37.485Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:35:00.081Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T06:53:59.211Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["Category:Database","Engineering Allocation","backend","database","devops::data_stores","group::database","missed:13.11","missed:13.12","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292443","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292443","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292443/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/292443/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#292443","relative":"#292443","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#292443"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3343,"epic":{"id":55478,"iid":3343,"title":"Improve performance of AuthorizedProjectsWorker","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3343","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 16, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
