But a few days after we started locking artifacts (that is, not simply clearing through the oldest artifacts in this index which is ordered by `expire_at`) performance became very poor. I think this is because this index has the entirety of the table in it, and we're attempting to filter for `locked = 2` which this index is not good at.\n\n### Proposal for a new index\n\nI suggest we add a new partial index tailored to this operation. While it is a highly specific index, I would recommend introducing it explicitly as a temporary index that will be removed when the backlog operation has finished and we remove the worker. The worker will live until 16.0, and the index would be removed at that point if not earlier. I propose we add:\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX tmp_index_job_artifacts_with_unknown_locked_status ON ci_job_artifacts USING btree (expire_at, job_id) WHERE locked = 2 AND expire_at IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis accomplishes two main things:\n\n1. Bringing artifacts with unknown locked status close to each other in an index to decrease the duration of index scans\n2. Excludes artifacts without `expire_at` values, since those artifacts are job traces that we don't want to process.\n\nWe've considered creating an index of `locked = 2` artifacts before, but decided against it because it would take a great deal of time to build as it would have included every row in the table. However, now with the job traces no longer having an expiration date we can use the two conditions together to build a partial index containing less than 200m rows.\n\nBonus things:\n\n1. We can drop the non-temporary index `index_ci_job_artifacts_on_expire_at_and_job_id` earlier than expected, since I believe this background process is the only workflow that sends queries to it. For good measure, we would build the new index and not drop this old one until we see it remaining completely idle for a significant period of time.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-18T21:58:15.765Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T19:15:54.809Z","closed_at":"2022-06-01T17:38:36.152Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew

They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\n\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\u003c!--\nA brief explanation of the why, not the what or how. Assume the reader doesn't know the\nbackground and won't have time to dig-up information from comment threads.\n--\u003e\n\nThe `LastCommit` Vue component currently retrieves HTML from Rails and renders it. This is a potential XSS vector which we should remove by migrating the server-side HTML over to client-side Vue components. We previously tried to address this using `v-html-safe` which introduced a rendering bug. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84862#note_908331969 for discussion.\n\nTo enable the frontend to begin constructing the HTML on the client side, we need to expose all the data used in the HTML via the [GraphQL LastCommitResolver](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a430cca9df0f44ca1b68a15c9c063eccbd22daab/app/graphql/resolvers/last_commit_resolver.rb#L11)\n\n\n## Implementation guide\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated.

Add a new `CommitSignatureType` to `app/graphql/types/`. This will be a multi-type field with the following possible types:\n   1. `CommitSignatures::GpgSignatureType`\n   2. `CommitSignatures::X509SignatureType`\n2. Add `GpgSignatureType` to `app/graphql/types/commit_signatures/` which exposes the following fields:\n   1. `user`\n   2. `verification_status`\n   3. `commit_sha`\n   4. `project`\n   5. `gpg_key_user_name`\n   6. `gpg_key_user_email`\n   7. `gpg_key_primary_keyid`\n3. Add an `X509Certificate` type to `app/graphql/types/` which exposes the fields on the [X509Certificate model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ed7496baa022608ab36a3609448fd861b8c49347/app/models/x509_certificate.rb)\n4. Add a `X509Signature` type to `app/graphql/types/commit_signatures/` which exposes the following fields:\n   1. `user`\n   2. `verification_status`\n   3. `commit_sha`\n   4. `project`\n   5. `x509_certificate`\n4. Expose the `CommitSignatureType` through the `:signature` field on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ed7496baa022608ab36a3609448fd861b8c49347/app/graphql/types/commit_type.rb\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n# ~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\nOther settings you might want to include when creating the issue.\n\n# /assign @\n# /epic \u0026\n--\u003e\n\n## Verification steps\n\u003c!--\nAdd verification steps to help GitLab team members test the implementation. This is particularly useful\nduring the MR review and the ~\"workflow::verification\" step. You may not know exactly what the\nverification steps should be during issue refinement, so you can always come back later to add\nthem.\n\n1. Check-out the corresponding branch\n1. ...\n1.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207474\n\nThis issue is to cleanup the `confidential_notes` feature flag, after the feature flag has been enabled by default for an appropriate amount of time in production.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::product planning\" \n- Most appropriate

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout

When we get a 204 - No Content on the initial poll, data is `undefined`\n\n`Object.keys(data)` causes an exception. We need to update `initExtensionPolling` to also expect the full response object so we can also do perhaps the following patch:\n\n## Note\n\nWith this patch we would need to update existing widgets with `enablePolling` to pass the full response.\n\nIt just feels odd to handle the headers in the multi-poll scenario and not the single endpoint scenario.

Boot Rest API discovery","description":"Java Spring Boot is one of the most popular ways to develop web APIs, especially for enterprise customers. This makes it a great first framework to perform API Discovery of.\n\n#### Goal\n\nGenerate an OpenAPI schema from a typical Spring Boot application that does not already produce its own schema, without running the application.\n\n#### Solution outline\n\n1. Target the compiled artifact\n    - We could integrate into the build process, but it would be hard to do so reliably given the number of build systems and their customizations. We would also have to account for build system versioning.\n    - Since Java artifacts are (reasonably) well-defined, targeting the compiled artifact creates a smaller amount of variation that we have to account for.\n1. Require the user to provide the Java runtime\n    - Choosing the correct runtime (both flavor and version) would significantly increase complexity, and risk incompatibilities with user code. The user should already have the SDK on which they produced their JVM-based artifact in the first place.\n    - This means that the solution will not be delivered via Docker, but will need to be executable on the user's runner.\n1. Store the solution in a package registry\n    - Since we are not relying on Docker, we will need another mechanism for delivering the executable solution. GitLab's [Package Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/) can store the executable, and the solution template could fetch (e.g. via curl) the executable from the registry and then execute it.\n    - We will need an additional project to expose the Package Registry, since the source project will be private.\n1. Don't run any user code\n    - Minimize side effects; user code could do anything\n    - It is impossible to completely prevent user code from running. Static initializers run when the class is loaded, which we will have to do in order to reflect on the metadata. There is not, as far as I know or can find, such thing as [reflection-only load](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/how-to-load-assemblies-into-the-reflection-only-context) in Java\n    - Consider [preventing the process from using the network](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25681670/disable-internet-access-for-jvm) to minimize side effects in case user code does run\n1. Use [SpringDoc OpenAPI](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi) to do the heavy lifting.\n    - SpringDoc knows how to interpret the Spring Boot metadata and translate it into an OpenAPI schema.   \n    - SpringDoc OpenAPI is designed to be used at runtime, which is not an option. However, mostly what it does is read metadata, which is available. So we will need to investigate if/how it can be used in a \"reflection-only\" mode.\n      - Because we will not be running the code, we can only generate a schema based on metadata. If the user is manipulating config at runtime in a way that is not exposed through metadata, the schema we generate may be inaccurate.\n1. ~~Matching versions~~ (not necessary)\n    - We could require the user to specify the version of Spring Boot (and possibly other dependencies) they are using. However, this goes against our goal of minimal configuration, so we should try not to require that if we can.\n    - We will need to determine how closely to the app's version of Spring Boot we want to match. Same minor version seems like a reasonable first attempt, but we may need to work around compatibility issues caused by version mismatches.  \n    - There are two reasons why determining the app's dependency versions might not be as straightforward as it would seem:\n        - Spring Boot is made up of many libraries. If the app is following best practices, they should be using the same version for all of their Spring Boot dependencies. However, there are many reasons why apps end up using different versions for some dependencies. We will have to figure out how to resolve to a single version to be compatible with.\n        - Because there is no concept of \"assemblies\" in Java, the actual identity of a dependency is mostly lost from the final artifact; only the filename remains visible. Java doesn't require the filename to have any information about the dependency in it. Fortunately the Maven repository format - used by both Maven and Gradle, the two dominant Java build systems - includes the version number in the filename. So we should be able to rely on this, and any edge case where such a filename is not included would be unsupported.\n1. ~~Dynamically load Spring Boot dependencies~~ (not necessary)\n    - Because we are determining what version to use dynamically, we cannot simply put Spring Boot on our own classpath. We will need to either download the corresponding version of required Spring Boot dependencies prior to or at runtime, or bundle all supported versions of required dependencies in our own executable and load the correct one at runtime. I lean towards the latter, to minimize the reliance on external network connectivity and associated transient failures. But it might depend on what that does to artifact size.\n\n#### Supported scenarios\n- Java 8, 11, 17 (LTS versions)\n    - Latest Spring Boot still supports Java 8 (!), and it's an LTS.\n    - Document support for the LTS versions, but note that non-LTS versions should also work.\n- Spring Boot 2.x\n    - 1.5 was released more than 5 years ago. We can note that it should work but we won't officially support it.\n- Artifact types:\n    - :white_check_mark: [Spring Boot Executable JAR](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html#appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.jar-structure)\n    - :white_check_mark: [Spring Boot Executable WAR](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html#appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.war-structure)\n    - :white_check_mark: [WAR](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19199-01/816-6774-10/a_war.html)\n    - :white_check_mark: [uber-JAR](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/index.html)\n        - ~~Unlike the other formats here, a shaded uber-JAR completely destroys the identify of its dependencies - even their filenames - in the process of creating the artifact. If knowing the version of the app's dependencies is important, we would need another way of determining them.~~\n        - It doesn't appear that we _need_ to know the version of Spring Boot in use, so we can likely support this as well.\n- Build systems\n    - :white_check_mark: Maven with SprintBoot plugin\n    - :white_check_mark: Maven without SpringBoot plugin\n    - :white_check_mark: Gradle with SpringBoot plugin\n    - :white_check_mark: Gradle without SpringBoot plugin\n        - Spring Boot pushes the plugins pretty strongly, but it is certainly possible to build a container-dependent WAR or an executable uber-JAR without them. As long as the resulting artifact is one of the supported types, the build system shouldn't matter.\n\n#### Out of scope for v1\n- **JAX-RS**: Spring Boot supports defining endpoints via JAX-RS annotations instead of its own annotations. However, SpringDoc does not support JAX-RS. The [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) library does support JAX-RS; we can consider adding support for it in the future.\n- **Kotlin**: although it is very likely that a Spring Boot application written in Kotlin would \"just work\", explicit support for that scenario can come later\n\n#### Project setup\n\n1. [x] Create project for code `api-discovery-src`\n    1. [x] Make @mikeeddington an Owner\n    - Do we want one repository for `api-discovery-src`, or a separate repository for each supported language (e.g. `api-discovery-java-src`)?\n1. [ ] Create CI template to use in testing\n    1. [ ] Save generated OpenAPI document as job artifact\n1. [ ] Create initial build and test jobs\n1. [ ] Find or create a pet store example project to test against\n1. [ ] Create an entry python script that looks for Java assets and launches java+spring -\u003e openapi tool\n    1. [ ] *.war, *.jar, *.class\n    - Can we assume that any Java assets that we find are what we want to analyze? Or do we need to the user to specify the artifact?\n    - Given that we will be executing on the user's runner, we should keep the dependencies to a minimum. Recommend against using Python and stick to shell scripts.\n    - How do we handle OS/shell differences in our template?\n1. Main code will be written in Kotlin\n    - [Why?](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362659#note_1024146231)\n\n#### Open questions / spikes\n\n1. :white_check_mark: Can SpringDoc be run in \"offline\" mode, i.e. without actually running the web app or user code?\n    - By creating our own Spring Context and wiring up Spring Boot, SpringDoc and the user code, we can invoke the `OpenAPIResource` bean and generate the schema\n    - Controllers are wired up as Singletons by default, which Spring creates eagerly by default. We can post-process all bean definitions to define them as `Lazy`, to prevent their eager creation.\n    - SpringDoc uses Spring APIs which have the side effect of creating the controller beans, but it doesn't actually need the controllers; those calls have to be intercepted to prevent the bean creation\n1. :white_check_mark: How do we find the customer code to register? Can we scan everything on the classpath?\n    - Running a component scan on \"*\" and excluding \"org.springframework.*\" seems to work. We can also exclude other known packages (like \"org.springdoc.*\") for safety.\n1. :white_check_mark: How to determine what version of Spring Boot the app is using?\n    - ~~How do we normalize different versions of Spring Boot assemblies being used?~~\n    - ~~Is this necessary? SpringDoc [seems to claim](https://springdoc.org/faq.html#_what_is_the_compatibility_matrix_of_springdoc_openapi_with_spring_boot) that its latest version can work all the way back to Spring Boot [1.5.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v1.5.0.RELEASE) (Jan 2017) and [2.0.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.0.0.RELEASE) (Feb 2018).~~\n        - ~~The other problem would be if our custom Spring context setup has to be version dependent; but that seems unlikely.~~\n    - SpringDoc works with all versions of Spring Boot we would care to support, so we don't _need_ the Spring Boot version.\n    - If we want to know the Spring Boot version (for logging, or to provide more tailored messaging, for example), we can pull it from the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file inside the artifact using `JarFile`, IF the artifact was built with the Spring Boot plugin.\n1. ~~If API Discovery needs to load different versions of its own dependencies to match different versions of target app dependencies, what's the best way to do that?~~\n1. :white_check_mark: Can we prevent the API Discovery process from using the network, to minimize side effects in case user code is executed? What restrictions will that place on what API Discovery can do?\n    - There are several ways to use the Java [`SecurityManager`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html) to prevent access to the network. The most straightforward way would be to create a custom `SecurityManager` and set it at the start of the `main` method. \n1. :white_check_mark: What versions of Spring Boot should we support? What exactly should \"support\" mean in this context: testing, documentation, promise of bug fixes? Does GitLab have a standard definition of \"supported\"?\n    - For example, we could say \"we have tested against 2.3 and believe it works, but since it is no longer supported by Spring, we do not commit to fixing any issues that only affect 2.3\"\n    - Spring seems to have a pretty aggressive timeline on support; 2.4 came out in November of 2020, and knowing enterprise upgrade efforts I am confident that many companies on older versions have not upgraded yet.\n    - See [Supported scenarios](#supported_scenarios)\n    - 5 years is a nice round number, which also happens to align with 2.0, another nice round number.\n\n#### Other resources\n\n- [Example of Spring Boot REST API](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/)\n- [OpenApi Sprint Boot generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-maven-plugin) -- This converts OpenAPI into Spring Boot. Could be useful for writing the reverse.\n- [Spring Boot support graph](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support)\n    - 3.0 will be released in November\n    - 2.3 went out of commercial support in August\n    - 2.4 is out of basic support and will be out of commercial support in February\n- [Oracle Java Support Roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-17T21:48:22.640Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T03:19:44.319Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T18:06:49.969Z","closed_by":{"id":1523140,"username":"DavidNelsonGL","name":"David Nelson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1523140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DavidNelsonGL"},"labels":["Category:API Security","backend","devops::secure","documentation","group::dynamic analysis","milestone::p1","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":1523140,"username":"DavidNelsonGL","name":"David Nelson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1523140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DavidNelsonGL"}],"author":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1523140,"username":"DavidNelsonGL","name":"David Nelson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1523140/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DavidNelsonGL"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362659","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":2},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 8 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362659","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362659/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362659/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#362659","relative":"#362659","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#362659"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7539,"epic":{"id":438861,"iid":7539,"title":"API Discovery","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7539","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":108706978,"iid":362657,"project_id":278964,"title":"Maven request forwarding to Maven Central","description":"### Context\n\nAs part of the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8081, this issue proposes extending the package request forwarding feature that GitLab offers for PyPI and npm to include Maven. That means that when you try to install a package from your GitLab package registry and it's not found, GitLab will forward the request to Maven-Central.\n\n#### Benefits\n\nThe reason a customer would want this is so that they don't have to include Maven Central in their configuration files for each developer. They could simplify the configurations for all of their developers and just include their GitLab instance, group, or project. \n\n#### A path to virtual registries\n\nThinking beyond the MVC, this issue also defines a clear path toward delivering virtual registries. The plan will be to build a request forwarding feature. Then turn it into a proxy. Then add caching. Then add the ability to configure up to 10 external remote Maven repositories. \n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the Maven repository so that when a package is not found in the GitLab repository, it automatically forwards the request to Maven central and installs the package from there. \n\nThe MVC will implement this at the instance-level to be consistent with forwarding of other formats (npm/pypi) and will be behind a feature flag to allow us to enable/disable for specific groups.\n\n#### Settings\n\nIt's possible that some users may not want this setting turned on. But the problem is that the setting is currently at the instance level. That's where the epic, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8067, comes into play. We will cascade the setting from the instance -\u003e group -\u003e subgroup. \n\nUntil the above is done, this feature will be behind a feature flag in limited availability but customers can request that we enable it for them. And of course, self-managed customers can do the same. \n\n#### Metrics\n\nTrack the number of requests forwarded per day. Similar to the metrics we have for npm and PyPI\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features

Imagine we have `limit: 3` and the following `ci_job_artifacts` records:\n\n| id | created_at |\n|----|------------|\n| 1  | 00:01      |\n| 2  | 00:02      |\n| 3  | 00:01      |\n| 4  | 00:04      |\n| 5  | 00:05      |\n\nThis could happen because `created_at` is set before the ID: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5819113\n\nThe `next_batch(limit: 3)` could return the ids in the order `1, 3, 2` since we do `order(:created_at)`. As we store `last_job_artifact_id: batch.last.id` when we finish the batch (which is `2` in this example). We may count the record with ID `3` again in `next_batch(limit: 3) --\u003e 3, 4, 5`.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWe should `order(:id)` so we have like-with-like comparison. But note that this may not be as simple as it sounds. We need to ensure that the index will still be used and the query will still be performant. In the past, when initially we tried to use `order(:id)` here, it was taking very long.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-17T16:33:52.287Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T09:46:19.479Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T07:28:50.997Z","closed_by":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"labels":["CI artifacts","Category:Build Artifacts","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline insights","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"}],"author":{"id":1758950,"username":"iamricecake","name":"Erick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1758950/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamricecake"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5251734,"username":"morefice","name":"Max Orefice","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a910912e24727d7eef579cd047f7651?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/morefice"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362640","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362640","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362640/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362640/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#362640","relative":"#362640","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#362640"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":108692587,"iid":362635,"project_id":278964,"title":"[License Compliance Widget Extension] - Backend - Add denied_licenses count to the collapsed license report endpoint.","description":"As a follow up to:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356336\n\n## Description\n\nAdd field to indicate `denied_licenses` count.

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations.

This finding relates to the insights of that research and further discussions of current features.\n\nArtifact menus can get extremely long. There can be over 100 artifacts listed within a single menu on the pipelines list page, and it makes it impossible to find a single artifact quickly. \n\n**Example:**\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-05-17_at_10.36.57_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/4284326c0937a511b30923e38169e956/Screen_Shot_2022-05-17_at_10.36.57_AM.png)\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a search bar to the menu so the user can search for a file. Update `ellipsis` to `download` icon and add a `chevron` indicating it is a dropdown.\n\n[:paintbrush: Designs in design management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362632/designs/artifacts-search.png)\n\nFor future iterations, we may make the search more advanced.\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

been enabled by default for an appropriate amount of time in production.\n\nThis feature flag has been in production since %\"14.9\" with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81489.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6419 for more context.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group:certify\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#f_service-desk` or `#g_product-planning`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @cablett or @johnhope\n- PM: @mjwood \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nAs of this writing, this feature flag has been default_enabled for ~3 months, so removal of the feature flag should be low risk. In the case of any issues the MR to remove the feature flag can be reverted.\n\n### Cleaning up the feature flag\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `use_received_header_for_incoming_emails` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete use_received_header_for_incoming_emails --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete use_received_header_for_incoming_emails --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete use_received_header_for_incoming_emails`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-17T09:01:35.672Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T15:49:34.145Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T21:08:22.631Z","closed_by":{"id":3717078,"username":"cablett","name":"charlie

if there's more than one backup process running, and it appears the backup code doesn't protect against this:  eg - a lock/PID file mechanism to identify the duplication\n\nSupport has been

Then the backup will cease running, and the concequence is likely to be customers who didn't know they had no backups.   So, ideally, the second backup needs to take reasonable steps to check if there's actually an existing backup running, and with bias towards trying to make a backup.\n\nAlternatively, segregate the temporary working directories. Perhaps make it optional, so a GitLab upgrade can \"request\" its own separate part of the filesystem, as a database backup won't use much space.   \n\n### Relevant logs and/or

It is a good idea to structure your merge requests this way as well:\n\n1. Modify database schemas to prepare to add Geo support for Alert Metric Images\n1. Implement Geo support of Alert Metric Images behind a feature flag\n1. Release Geo support of Alert Metric Images\n\nIt is also a good idea to first open a proof-of-concept merge request. It can be helpful for working out kinks and getting initial support and feedback from the Geo team. As an example, see the [Proof of Concept to replicate Pipeline Artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56423).\n\nYou can look into the following examples of MRs for implementing replication/verification for a new blob type:\n- [Add db changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60935) and [add verification for MR diffs using SSF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63309)\n- [Verify Terraform state versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58800)\n- [Verify LFS objects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63981)\n\n### Modify database schemas to prepare to add Geo support for Alert Metric Images\n\nYou might do this section in its own merge request, but it is not required.\n\n#### Add the registry table to track replication and verification state\n\nGeo secondary sites have a [Geo tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/geo.md#tracking-database) independent of the main database. It is used to track the replication and verification state of all replicables. Every Model has a corresponding \"registry\" table in the Geo tracking database.\n\n- [x] Create the migration file in `ee/db/geo/migrate`:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rails generate migration CreateAlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry --database geo\n  ```\n\n- [x] Replace the contents of the migration file with the following. Note that we cannot add a foreign key constraint on `alert_management_alert_metric_image_id` because the `alert_management_alert_metric_images` table is in a different database. The application code must handle logic such as propagating deletions.\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class CreateAlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry \u003c Gitlab::Database::Migration[1.0]\n    disable_ddl_transaction!\n\n    def up\n      ApplicationRecord.transaction do\n        create_table :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry, id: :bigserial, force: :cascade do |t|\n          t.bigint :alert_management_alert_metric_image_id, null: false\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :created_at, null: false\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :last_synced_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :retry_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :verified_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_started_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_retry_at\n          t.integer :state, default: 0, null: false, limit: 2\n          t.integer :verification_state, default: 0, null: false, limit: 2\n          t.integer :retry_count, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n          t.integer :verification_retry_count, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n          t.boolean :checksum_mismatch, default: false, null: false\n          t.binary :verification_checksum\n          t.binary :verification_checksum_mismatched\n          t.text :verification_failure, limit: 255\n          t.text :last_sync_failure, limit: 255\n\n          t.index :alert_management_alert_metric_image_id, name: :index_alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_on_alert_management_alert_metric_image_id, unique: true\n          t.index :retry_at\n          t.index :state\n          # To optimize performance of AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.verification_failed_batch\n          t.index :verification_retry_at, name:  :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_failed_verification, order: \"NULLS FIRST\",  where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = 3))\"\n          # To optimize performance of AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.needs_verification_count\n          t.index :verification_state, name:  :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_needs_verification, where: \"((state = 2)  AND (verification_state = ANY (ARRAY[0, 3])))\"\n          # To optimize performance of AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.verification_pending_batch\n          t.index :verified_at, name: :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_pending_verification, order: \"NULLS FIRST\", where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = 0))\"\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    def down\n      drop_table :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] If deviating from the above example, then be sure to order columns according to [our guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/ordering_table_columns.md).\n\n- [x] Add the new table to the GitLab Schema defined in [`ee/lib/ee/gitlab/database/gitlab_schemas.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/database/gitlab_schemas.yml).\n\n   ```yaml\n   alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry: :gitlab_geo\n   ```\n\n- [x] Run Geo tracking database migrations:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rake db:migrate:geo\n  ```\n\n- [x] Be sure to commit the relevant changes in `ee/db/geo/structure.sql`\n\n### Add verification state fields on the Geo primary site\n\nThe Geo primary site needs to checksum every replicable so secondaries can verify their own checksums. To do this, Geo requires fields on the Model. Add verification state fields to a separate table. Consult a database expert if needed.\n\n#### Add verification state fields to a new table\n\n- [x] Create the migration file in `db/migrate`:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rails generate migration CreateAlertManagement::MetricImageStates\n  ```\n\n- [x] Replace the contents of the migration file with:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class CreateAlertManagement::MetricImageStates \u003c Gitlab::Database::Migration[2.0]\n    VERIFICATION_STATE_INDEX_NAME = \"index_alert_management_alert_metric_image_states_on_verification_state\"\n    PENDING_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME = \"index_alert_management_alert_metric_image_states_pending_verification\"\n    FAILED_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME = \"index_alert_management_alert_metric_image_states_failed_verification\"\n    NEEDS_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME = \"index_alert_management_alert_metric_image_states_needs_verification\"\n\n    enable_lock_retries!\n\n    def up\n      create_table :alert_management_alert_metric_image_states, id: false do |t|\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_started_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_retry_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verified_at\n        t.references :alert_management_alert_metric_image, primary_key: true, default: nil, index: false, foreign_key: { on_delete: :cascade }\n        t.integer :verification_state, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n        t.integer :verification_retry_count, limit: 2\n        t.binary :verification_checksum, using: 'verification_checksum::bytea'\n        t.text :verification_failure, limit: 255\n\n        t.index :verification_state, name: VERIFICATION_STATE_INDEX_NAME\n        t.index :verified_at, where: \"(verification_state = 0)\", order: { verified_at: 'ASC NULLS FIRST' }, name: PENDING_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME\n        t.index :verification_retry_at, where: \"(verification_state = 3)\", order: { verification_retry_at: 'ASC NULLS FIRST' }, name: FAILED_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME\n        t.index :verification_state, where: \"(verification_state = 0 OR verification_state = 3)\", name: NEEDS_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME\n      end\n    end\n\n    def down\n      drop_table :alert_management_alert_metric_image_states\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] If deviating from the above example, then be sure to order columns according to [our guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/ordering_table_columns.md).\n\n- [x] Add the new table to the GitLab Schema defined in [`lib/gitlab/database/gitlab_schemas.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/gitlab_schemas.yml) with the databases they need to be added to.\n\n   ```yaml\n   alert_management_alert_metric_image_states: :gitlab_main\n   ```\n\n- [x] Run database migrations:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rake db:migrate\n  ```\n\n- [x] If `alert_management_alert_metric_images` is a high-traffic table, follow [the database documentation to use `with_lock_retries`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/migration_style_guide.md#when-to-use-the-helper-method)\n\n- [x] Be sure to commit the relevant changes in `db/structure.sql`\n\nThat's all of the required database changes.\n\n### Implement Geo support of Alert Metric Images behind a feature flag\n\n#### Step 1. Implement replication and verification\n\n- [x] Add the following lines to the `alert_management_alert_metric_image` model to accomplish some important tasks:\n  - Include `::Geo::ReplicableModel` in the `AlertManagement::MetricImage` class, and specify the Replicator class `with_replicator Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageReplicator`.\n  - Include the `::Geo::VerifiableModel` concern.\n  - Delegate verification related methods to the `alert_management_alert_metric_image_state` model.\n  - For verification, override some scopes to use the `alert_management_alert_metric_image_states` table instead of the model table.\n  - Implement the `verification_state_object` method to return the object that holds\n    the verification details\n  - Override some methods to use the `alert_management_alert_metric_image_states` table in verification-related queries.\n\n  At this point the `AlertManagement::MetricImage` class should look like this:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class AlertManagement::MetricImage \u003c ApplicationRecord\n    ...\n    include ::Geo::ReplicableModel\n    include ::Geo::VerifiableModel\n\n    delegate(*::Geo::VerificationState::VERIFICATION_METHODS, to: :alert_management_alert_metric_image_state)\n\n    with_replicator Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageReplicator\n\n    mount_uploader :file, AlertManagement::MetricImageUploader\n\n    has_one :alert_management_alert_metric_image_state, autosave: false, inverse_of: :alert_management_alert_metric_image, class_name: 'Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageState'\n\n    after_save :save_verification_details\n\n    scope :with_verification_state, -\u003e(state) { joins(:alert_management_alert_metric_image_state).where(alert_management_alert_metric_image_states: { verification_state: verification_state_value(state) }) }\n    scope :checksummed, -\u003e { joins(:alert_management_alert_metric_image_state).where.not(alert_management_alert_metric_image_states: { verification_checksum: nil } ) }\n    scope :not_checksummed, -\u003e { joins(:alert_management_alert_metric_image_state).where(alert_management_alert_metric_image_states: { verification_checksum: nil } ) }\n\n    scope :available_verifiables, -\u003e { joins(:alert_management_alert_metric_image_state) }\n\n    # Override the `all` default if not all records can be replicated.

It is called when\n        # we want to know which records to replicate. This is not easy to automate\n        # because for example:\n        #\n        # * The \"selective sync\" feature allows admins to choose which namespaces #   to replicate, per secondary site. Most Models are scoped to a\n        #   namespace, but the nature of the relationship to a namespace varies\n        #   between Models.\n        # * The \"selective sync\" feature allows admins to choose which shards to\n        #   replicate, per secondary site. Repositories are associated with\n        #   shards. Most blob types are not, but Project Uploads are.\n        # * Remote stored replicables are not replicated, by default. But the\n        #   setting `sync_object_storage` enables replication of remote stored\n        #   replicables.\n        #\n        # Search the codebase for examples, and consult a Geo expert if needed.\n      end\n\n      override :verification_state_table_class\n      def verification_state_table_class\n        AlertManagement::MetricImageState\n      end\n    end\n    ...\n\n    def alert_management_alert_metric_image_state\n      super || build_alert_management_alert_metric_image_state\n    end\n\n    ...\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Implement `AlertManagement::MetricImage.replicables_for_current_secondary` above.\n- [x] Ensure `AlertManagement::MetricImage.replicables_for_current_secondary` is well-tested. Search the codebase for `replicables_for_current_secondary` to find examples of parameterized table specs. You may need to add more `FactoryBot` traits.\n- [x] Add the following shared examples to `ee/spec/models/ee/alert_management_alert_metric_image_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n    include_examples 'a replicable model with a separate table for verification state' do\n      let(:verifiable_model_record) { build(:alert_management_alert_metric_image) } # add extra params if needed to make sure the record is included in `available_verifiables`\n      let(:unverifiable_model_record) { build(:alert_management_alert_metric_image) } # add extra params if needed to make sure the record is NOT included in `available_verifiables`\n    end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/app/replicators/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_replicator.rb`. Implement the `#carrierwave_uploader` method which should return a `CarrierWave::Uploader`, and implement the class method `.model` to return the `AlertManagement::MetricImage` class:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class AlertManagement::MetricImageReplicator \u003c Gitlab::Geo::Replicator\n      include ::Geo::BlobReplicatorStrategy\n      extend ::Gitlab::Utils::Override\n\n      def self.model\n        ::AlertManagement::MetricImage\n      end\n\n      def carrierwave_uploader\n        model_record.file\n      end\n\n      override :verification_feature_flag_enabled?\n      def self.verification_feature_flag_enabled?\n        # We are adding verification at the same time as replication, so we\n        # don't need to toggle verification separately from replication. When\n        # the replication feature flag is off, then verification is also off\n        # (see `VerifiableReplicator.verification_enabled?`)\n        true\n      end\n\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Generate the feature flag definition fileы by running the feature flag commands and following the command prompts:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/feature-flag --ee geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_replication --type development --group 'group::geo'\n  bin/feature-flag --ee geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_verification --type development --group 'group::geo'\n  ```\n\n- [x] Add this replicator class to the method `replicator_classes` in\n  `ee/lib/gitlab/geo.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  REPLICATOR_CLASSES = [\n    ::Geo::PackageFileReplicator,\n    ::Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageReplicator\n  ]\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/spec/replicators/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_replicator_spec.rb` and perform the necessary setup to define the `model_record` variable for the shared examples:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageReplicator do\n    let(:model_record) { build(:alert_management_alert_metric_image) }\n\n    include_examples 'a blob replicator'\n    include_examples 'a verifiable replicator'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/app/models/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry \u003c Geo::BaseRegistry\n    include ::Geo::ReplicableRegistry\n    include ::Geo::VerifiableRegistry\n\n    MODEL_CLASS = ::AlertManagement::MetricImage\n    MODEL_FOREIGN_KEY = :alert_management_alert_metric_image_id\n\n    belongs_to :alert_management_alert_metric_image, class_name: 'AlertManagement::MetricImage'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Update `REGISTRY_CLASSES` in `ee/app/workers/geo/secondary/registry_consistency_worker.rb`.\n- [x] Add a custom factory name if needed in `def model_class_factory_name` in `ee/spec/support/helpers/ee/geo_helpers.rb`.\n- [x] Update `it 'creates missing registries for each registry class'` in `ee/spec/workers/geo/secondary/registry_consistency_worker_spec.rb`.\n- [x] Add `alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry` to `ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections` in `config/initializers_before_autoloader/000_inflections.rb`.\n- [x] Create `ee/spec/factories/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  FactoryBot.define do\n    factory :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry, class: 'Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry' do\n      alert_management_alert_metric_image # This association should have data, like a file or repository\n      state { Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.state_value(:pending) }\n\n      trait :synced do\n        state { Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.state_value(:synced) }\n        last_synced_at { 5.days.ago }\n      end\n\n      trait :failed do\n        state { Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.state_value(:failed) }\n        last_synced_at { 1.day.ago }\n        retry_count { 2 }\n        last_sync_failure { 'Random error' }\n      end\n\n      trait :started do\n        state { Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.state_value(:started) }\n        last_synced_at { 1.day.ago }\n        retry_count { 0 }\n      end\n\n      trait :verification_succeeded do\n        verification_checksum { 'e079a831cab27bcda7d81cd9b48296d0c3dd92ef' }\n        verification_state { Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry.verification_state_value(:verification_succeeded) }\n        verified_at { 5.days.ago }\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/spec/models/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry, :geo, type: :model do\n    let_it_be(:registry) { create(:geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry) }\n\n    specify 'factory is valid' do\n      expect(registry).to be_valid\n    end\n\n    include_examples 'a Geo framework registry'\n    include_examples 'a Geo verifiable registry'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Add the following to `spec/factories/alert_management_alert_metric_images.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  trait(:verification_succeeded) do\n    with_file\n    verification_checksum { 'abc' }\n    verification_state { AlertManagement::MetricImage.verification_state_value(:verification_succeeded) }\n  end\n\n  trait(:verification_failed) do\n    with_file\n    verification_failure { 'Could not calculate the checksum' }\n    verification_state { AlertManagement::MetricImage.verification_state_value(:verification_failed) }\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Make sure the factory also allows setting a `project` attribute. If the model does not have a direct relation to a project, you can use a `transient` attribute. Check out `spec/factories/merge_request_diffs.rb` for an example.\n\n- [x] Following [the example of Merge Request Diffs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63309) add a `Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageState` model in `ee/app/models/ee/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_state.rb`:\n\n  ``` ruby\n  module Geo\n    class AlertManagement::MetricImageState \u003c ApplicationRecord\n      include EachBatch\n      include ::Geo::VerificationStateDefinition\n\n      self.primary_key = :alert_management_alert_metric_image_id\n\n      belongs_to :alert_management_alert_metric_image, inverse_of: :alert_management_alert_metric_image_state\n\n      validates :verification_failure, length: { maximum: 255 }\n      validates :verification_state, :alert_management_alert_metric_image, presence: true\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Add a `factory` for `alert_management_alert_metric_image_state`, in `ee/spec/factories/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_states.rb`:\n\n  ``` ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  FactoryBot.define do\n    factory :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_state, class: 'Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageState' do\n      alert_management_alert_metric_image\n\n      trait(:checksummed) do\n        verification_checksum { 'abc' }\n      end\n\n      trait(:checksum_failure) do\n        verification_failure { 'Could not calculate the checksum' }\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n#### Step 2. Implement metrics gathering\n\nMetrics are gathered by `Geo::MetricsUpdateWorker`, persisted in `GeoNodeStatus` for display in the UI, and sent to Prometheus:\n\n- [x] Add the following fields to Geo Node Status example responses in `doc/api/geo_nodes.md`:\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_checksum_total_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_checksummed_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_checksum_failed_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_synced_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_failed_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_registry_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_verification_total_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_verified_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_verification_failed_count`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_synced_in_percentage`\n  - `alert_management_alert_metric_images_verified_in_percentage`\n- [x] Add the same fields to `GET /geo_nodes/status` example response in\n  `ee/spec/fixtures/api/schemas/public_api/v4/geo_node_status.json`.\n- [x] Add the following fields to the `Sidekiq metrics` table in `doc/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.md`:\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_checksum_total`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_checksummed`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_checksum_failed`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_synced`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_failed`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_registry`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_verification_total`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_verified`\n  - `geo_alert_management_alert_metric_images_verification_failed`\n\nAlert Metric Image replication and verification metrics should now be available in the API, the `Admin \u003e Geo \u003e Nodes` view, and Prometheus.\n\n#### Step 3. Implement the GraphQL API\n\nThe GraphQL API is used by `Admin \u003e Geo \u003e Replication Details` views, and is directly queryable by administrators.\n\n- [x] Add a new field to `GeoNodeType` in `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  field :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registries, ::Types::Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistryType.connection_type,\n        null: true,\n        resolver: ::Resolvers::Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistriesResolver,\n        description: 'Find Alert Metric Image registries on this Geo node',\n        feature_flag: :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_replication\n  ```\n\n- [x] Add the new `alert_management_alert_metric_image_registries` field name to the `expected_fields` array in `ee/spec/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type_spec.rb`.\n- [x] Create `ee/app/graphql/resolvers/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registries_resolver.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Resolvers\n    module Geo\n      class AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistriesResolver \u003c BaseResolver\n        type ::Types::Geo::GeoNodeType.connection_type, null: true\n\n        include RegistriesResolver\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/spec/graphql/resolvers/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registries_resolver_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Resolvers::Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistriesResolver do\n    it_behaves_like 'a Geo registries resolver', :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/app/finders/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_finder.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistryFinder\n      include FrameworkRegistryFinder\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/spec/finders/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_finder_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistryFinder do\n    it_behaves_like 'a framework registry finder', :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_type.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Types\n    module Geo\n      # rubocop:disable Graphql/AuthorizeTypes because it is included\n      class AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistryType \u003c BaseObject\n        include ::Types::Geo::RegistryType\n\n        graphql_name 'AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry'\n        description 'Represents the Geo replication and verification state of a alert_management_alert_metric_image'\n\n        field :alert_management_alert_metric_image_id, GraphQL::ID_TYPE, null: false, description: 'ID of the Alert Metric Image'\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Create `ee/spec/graphql/types/geo/alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry_type_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe GitlabSchema.types['AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry'] do\n    it_behaves_like 'a Geo registry type'\n\n    it 'has the expected fields (other than those included in RegistryType)' do\n      expected_fields = %i[alert_management_alert_metric_image_id]\n\n      expect(described_class).to have_graphql_fields(*expected_fields).at_least\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [x] Add integration tests for providing AlertManagement::MetricImage registry data to the frontend via the GraphQL API, by duplicating and modifying the following shared examples in `ee/spec/requests/api/graphql/geo/registries_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  it_behaves_like 'gets registries for', {\n    field_name: 'alertManagmentMetricImageRegistries',\n    registry_class_name: 'AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistry',\n    registry_factory: :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_registry,\n    registry_foreign_key_field_name: 'alertManagmentMetricImageId'\n  }\n  ```\n\n- [x] Update the GraphQL reference documentation:\n\n  ```shell\n  bundle exec rake gitlab:graphql:compile_docs\n  ```\n\nIndividual Alert Metric Image replication and verification data should now be available via the GraphQL API.\n\n#### Step 4. Handle batch destroy\n\nIf batch destroy logic is implemented for a replicable, then that logic must be \"replicated\" by Geo secondaries. The easiest way to do this is use `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` to bulk insert a delete event for each replicable.\n\nFor example, if `FastDestroyAll` is used, then you may be able to [use `begin_fast_destroy` and `finalize_fast_destroy` hooks, like we did for uploads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69763).\n\nOr if a special service is used to batch delete records and their associated data, then you probably need to [hook into that service, like we did for job artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79530).\n\nAs illustrated by the above two examples, batch destroy logic cannot be handled automatically by Geo secondaries without restricting the way other teams perform batch destroys. It is up to you to produce `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` attributes before the records are deleted, and then enqueue `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` after the records are deleted.\n\n- [x] Ensure that any batch destroy of this replicable is replicated to secondary sites\n- [x] Regardless of implementation details, please verify in specs that when the parent object is removed, the new `Geo::Event` records are created:\n\n```ruby\n  describe '#destroy' do\n    subject { create(:alert_management_alert_metric_image) }\n\n    context 'when running in a Geo primary node' do\n      let_it_be(:primary) { create(:geo_node, :primary) }\n      let_it_be(:secondary) { create(:geo_node) }\n\n      it 'logs an event to the Geo event log when bulk removal is used', :sidekiq_inline do\n        stub_current_geo_node(primary)\n\n        expect { subject.project.destroy! }.to change(Geo::Event.where(replicable_name: :alert_management_alert_metric_image, event_name: :deleted), :count).by(1)\n\n        payload = Geo::Event.where(replicable_name: :alert_management_alert_metric_image, event_name: :deleted).last.payload\n\n        expect(payload['model_record_id']).to eq(subject.id)\n        expect(payload['blob_path']).to eq(subject.relative_path)\n        expect(payload['uploader_class']).to eq('AlertManagement::MetricImageUploader')\n      end\n    end\n  end\n```\n\n### Release Geo support of Alert Metric Images\n\n- [x] In the rollout issue you created when creating the feature flag, modify the Roll Out Steps:\n  - [x] Cross out any steps related to testing on production GitLab.com, because Geo is not running on production GitLab.com at the moment.\n  - [x] Add a step to `Test replication and verification of Alert Metric Images on a non-GDK-deployment. For example, using GitLab Environment Toolkit`.\n  - [x] Add a step to `Ping the Geo PM and EM to coordinate testing`. For example, you might add steps to generate Alert Metric Images, and then a Geo engineer may take it from there.\n- [x] In `ee/config/feature_flags/development/geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_replication.yml`, set `default_enabled: true`\n- [x] In `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type.rb`, remove the `feature_flag` option for the released type:\n\n  ```ruby\n  field :alert_management_alert_metric_image_registries, ::Types::Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistryType.connection_type,\n        null: true,\n        resolver: ::Resolvers::Geo::AlertManagement::MetricImageRegistriesResolver,\n        description: 'Find Alert Metric Image registries on this Geo node',\n        feature_flag: :geo_alert_management_alert_metric_image_replication # REMOVE THIS LINE\n  ```\n\n- [x] Run `bundle exec rake gitlab:graphql:compile_docs` after the step above to regenerate the GraphQL docs.\n\n- [x] Add a row for Alert Metric Images to the `Data types` table in [Geo data types support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.md#data-types)\n- [x] Add a row for Alert Metric Images to the `Limitations on replication/verification` table in [Geo data types support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.md#limitations-on-replicationverification). If the row already exists, then update it to show that Replication and Verification is released in the current version.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-17T01:34:37.930Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T15:37:28.082Z","closed_at":"2022-10-14T15:04:18.215Z","closed_by":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","automation:ml","devops::systems","feature::addition","group::geo","section::enablement","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It is a good idea to structure your merge requests this way as well:\n\n1. Modify database schemas to prepare to add Geo support for Issuable Metric Images\n1. Implement Geo support of Issuable Metric Images behind a feature flag\n1. Release Geo support of Issuable Metric Images\n\nIt is also a good idea to first open a proof-of-concept merge request. It can be helpful for working out kinks and getting initial support and feedback from the Geo team. As an example, see the [Proof of Concept to replicate Pipeline Artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56423).\n\nYou can look into the following examples of MRs for implementing replication/verification for a new blob type:\n- [Add db changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60935) and [add verification for MR diffs using SSF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63309)\n- [Verify Terraform state versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/58800)\n- [Verify LFS objects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63981)\n\n### Modify database schemas to prepare to add Geo support for Issuable Metric Images\n\nYou might do this section in its own merge request, but it is not required.\n\n#### Add the registry table to track replication and verification state\n\nGeo secondary sites have a [Geo tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/geo.md#tracking-database) independent of the main database. It is used to track the replication and verification state of all replicables. Every Model has a corresponding \"registry\" table in the Geo tracking database.\n\n- [ ] Create the migration file in `ee/db/geo/migrate`:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rails generate migration CreateIssuableMetricImageRegistry --database geo\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Replace the contents of the migration file with the following. Note that we cannot add a foreign key constraint on `issuable_metric_image_id` because the `issuable_metric_images` table is in a different database. The application code must handle logic such as propagating deletions.\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class CreateIssuableMetricImageRegistry \u003c Gitlab::Database::Migration[1.0]\n    disable_ddl_transaction!\n\n    def up\n      ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do\n        create_table :issuable_metric_image_registry, id: :bigserial, force: :cascade do |t|\n          t.bigint :issuable_metric_image_id, null: false\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :created_at, null: false\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :last_synced_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :retry_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :verified_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_started_at\n          t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_retry_at\n          t.integer :state, default: 0, null: false, limit: 2\n          t.integer :verification_state, default: 0, null: false, limit: 2\n          t.integer :retry_count, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n          t.integer :verification_retry_count, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n          t.boolean :checksum_mismatch, default: false, null: false\n          t.binary :verification_checksum\n          t.binary :verification_checksum_mismatched\n          t.text :verification_failure, limit: 255\n          t.text :last_sync_failure, limit: 255\n\n          t.index :issuable_metric_image_id, name: :index_issuable_metric_image_registry_on_issuable_metric_image_id, unique: true\n          t.index :retry_at\n          t.index :state\n          # To optimize performance of IssuableMetricImageRegistry.verification_failed_batch\n          t.index :verification_retry_at, name:  :issuable_metric_image_registry_failed_verification, order: \"NULLS FIRST\",  where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = 3))\"\n          # To optimize performance of IssuableMetricImageRegistry.needs_verification_count\n          t.index :verification_state, name:  :issuable_metric_image_registry_needs_verification, where: \"((state = 2)  AND (verification_state = ANY (ARRAY[0, 3])))\"\n          # To optimize performance of IssuableMetricImageRegistry.verification_pending_batch\n          t.index :verified_at, name: :issuable_metric_image_registry_pending_verification, order: \"NULLS FIRST\", where: \"((state = 2) AND (verification_state = 0))\"\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    def down\n      drop_table :issuable_metric_image_registry\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] If deviating from the above example, then be sure to order columns according to [our guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/ordering_table_columns.md).\n- [ ] Run Geo tracking database migrations:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rake db:migrate:geo\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Be sure to commit the relevant changes in `ee/db/geo/structure.sql`\n\n### Add verification state fields on the Geo primary site\n\nThe Geo primary site needs to checksum every replicable so secondaries can verify their own checksums. To do this, Geo requires fields on the Model. Add verification state fields to a separate table. Consult a database expert if needed.\n\n#### Add verification state fields to a new table\n\n- [ ] Create the migration file in `db/migrate`:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rails generate migration CreateIssuableMetricImageStates\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Replace the contents of the migration file with:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class CreateIssuableMetricImageStates \u003c Gitlab::Database::Migration[2.0]\n    VERIFICATION_STATE_INDEX_NAME = \"index_issuable_metric_image_states_on_verification_state\"\n    PENDING_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME = \"index_issuable_metric_image_states_pending_verification\"\n    FAILED_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME = \"index_issuable_metric_image_states_failed_verification\"\n    NEEDS_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME = \"index_issuable_metric_image_states_needs_verification\"\n\n    enable_lock_retries!\n\n    def up\n      create_table :issuable_metric_image_states, id: false do |t|\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_started_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verification_retry_at\n        t.datetime_with_timezone :verified_at\n        t.references :issuable_metric_image, primary_key: true, null: false, foreign_key: { on_delete: :cascade }\n        t.integer :verification_state, default: 0, limit: 2, null: false\n        t.integer :verification_retry_count, limit: 2\n        t.binary :verification_checksum, using: 'verification_checksum::bytea'\n        t.text :verification_failure, limit: 255\n\n        t.index :verification_state, name: VERIFICATION_STATE_INDEX_NAME\n        t.index :verified_at, where: \"(verification_state = 0)\", order: { verified_at: 'ASC NULLS FIRST' }, name: PENDING_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME\n        t.index :verification_retry_at, where: \"(verification_state = 3)\", order: { verification_retry_at: 'ASC NULLS FIRST' }, name: FAILED_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME\n        t.index :verification_state, where: \"(verification_state = 0 OR verification_state = 3)\", name: NEEDS_VERIFICATION_INDEX_NAME\n      end\n    end\n\n    def down\n      drop_table :issuable_metric_image_states\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] If deviating from the above example, then be sure to order columns according to [our guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/ordering_table_columns.md).\n\n- [ ] Run database migrations:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/rake db:migrate\n  ```\n\n- [ ] If `issuable_metric_images` is a high-traffic table, follow [the database documentation to use `with_lock_retries`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/migration_style_guide.md#when-to-use-the-helper-method)\n\n- [ ] Be sure to commit the relevant changes in `db/structure.sql`\n\nThat's all of the required database changes.\n\n### Implement Geo support of Issuable Metric Images behind a feature flag\n\n#### Step 1. Implement replication and verification\n\n- [ ] Add the following lines to the `issuable_metric_image` model to accomplish some important tasks:\n  - Include `::Geo::ReplicableModel` in the `IssuableMetricImage` class, and specify the Replicator class `with_replicator Geo::IssuableMetricImageReplicator`.\n  - Include the `::Geo::VerifiableModel` concern.\n  - Delegate verification related methods to the `issuable_metric_image_state` model.\n  - For verification, override some scopes to use the `issuable_metric_image_states` table instead of the model table.\n  - Implement the `verification_state_object` method to return the object that holds\n    the verification details\n  - Override some methods to use the `issuable_metric_image_states` table in verification-related queries.\n\n  At this point the `IssuableMetricImage` class should look like this:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class IssuableMetricImage \u003c ApplicationRecord\n    ...\n    include ::Geo::ReplicableModel\n    include ::Geo::VerifiableModel\n\n    delegate(*::Geo::VerificationState::VERIFICATION_METHODS, to: :issuable_metric_image_state)\n\n    with_replicator Geo::IssuableMetricImageReplicator\n\n    mount_uploader :file, IssuableMetricImageUploader\n\n    has_one :issuable_metric_image_state, autosave: false, inverse_of: :issuable_metric_image, class_name: 'Geo::IssuableMetricImageState'\n\n    after_save :save_verification_details\n\n    scope :with_verification_state, -\u003e(state) { joins(:issuable_metric_image_state).where(issuable_metric_image_states: { verification_state: verification_state_value(state) }) }\n    scope :checksummed, -\u003e { joins(:issuable_metric_image_state).where.not(issuable_metric_image_states: { verification_checksum: nil } ) }\n    scope :not_checksummed, -\u003e { joins(:issuable_metric_image_state).where(issuable_metric_image_states: { verification_checksum: nil } ) }\n\n    scope :available_verifiables, -\u003e { joins(:issuable_metric_image_state) }\n\n    # Override the `all` default if not all records can be replicated. For an\n    # example of an existing Model that needs to do this, see\n    # `EE::MergeRequestDiff`.\n    # scope :available_replicables, -\u003e { all }\n\n    def verification_state_object\n      issuable_metric_image_state\n    end\n    ...\n\n    class_methods do\n      extend ::Gitlab::Utils::Override\n      ...\n\n      # @param primary_key_in [Range, IssuableMetricImage] arg to pass to primary_key_in scope\n      # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation\u003cIssuableMetricImage\u003e] everything that should be synced to this node, restricted by primary key\n      def self.replicables_for_current_secondary(primary_key_in)\n        # This issue template does not help you write this method.\n        #\n        # This method is called only on Geo secondary sites. It is called when\n        # we want to know which records to replicate. This is not easy to automate\n        # because for example:\n        #\n        # * The \"selective sync\" feature allows admins to choose which namespaces #   to replicate, per secondary site. Most Models are scoped to a\n        #   namespace, but the nature of the relationship to a namespace varies\n        #   between Models.\n        # * The \"selective sync\" feature allows admins to choose which shards to\n        #   replicate, per secondary site. Repositories are associated with\n        #   shards. Most blob types are not, but Project Uploads are.\n        # * Remote stored replicables are not replicated, by default. But the\n        #   setting `sync_object_storage` enables replication of remote stored\n        #   replicables.\n        #\n        # Search the codebase for examples, and consult a Geo expert if needed.\n      end\n\n      override :verification_state_table_class\n      def verification_state_table_class\n        IssuableMetricImageState\n      end\n    end\n    ...\n\n    def issuable_metric_image_state\n      super || build_issuable_metric_image_state\n    end\n\n    ...\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Implement `IssuableMetricImage.replicables_for_current_secondary` above.\n- [ ] Ensure `IssuableMetricImage.replicables_for_current_secondary` is well-tested. Search the codebase for `replicables_for_current_secondary` to find examples of parameterized table specs. You may need to add more `FactoryBot` traits.\n- [ ] Add the following shared examples to `ee/spec/models/ee/issuable_metric_image_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n    include_examples 'a replicable model with a separate table for verification state' do\n      let(:verifiable_model_record) { build(:issuable_metric_image) } # add extra params if needed to make sure the record is included in `available_verifiables`\n      let(:unverifiable_model_record) { build(:issuable_metric_image) } # add extra params if needed to make sure the record is NOT included in `available_verifiables`\n    end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/replicators/geo/issuable_metric_image_replicator.rb`. Implement the `#carrierwave_uploader` method which should return a `CarrierWave::Uploader`, and implement the class method `.model` to return the `IssuableMetricImage` class:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class IssuableMetricImageReplicator \u003c Gitlab::Geo::Replicator\n      include ::Geo::BlobReplicatorStrategy\n      extend ::Gitlab::Utils::Override\n\n      def self.model\n        ::IssuableMetricImage\n      end\n\n      def carrierwave_uploader\n        model_record.file\n      end\n\n      override :verification_feature_flag_enabled?\n      def self.verification_feature_flag_enabled?\n        # We are adding verification at the same time as replication, so we\n        # don't need to toggle verification separately from replication. When\n        # the replication feature flag is off, then verification is also off\n        # (see `VerifiableReplicator.verification_enabled?`)\n        true\n      end\n\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Generate the feature flag definition fileы by running the feature flag commands and following the command prompts:\n\n  ```shell\n  bin/feature-flag --ee geo_issuable_metric_image_replication --type development --group 'group::geo'\n  bin/feature-flag --ee geo_issuable_metric_image_verification --type development --group 'group::geo'\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add this replicator class to the method `replicator_classes` in\n  `ee/lib/gitlab/geo.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  REPLICATOR_CLASSES = [\n    ::Geo::PackageFileReplicator,\n    ::Geo::IssuableMetricImageReplicator\n  ]\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/replicators/geo/issuable_metric_image_replicator_spec.rb` and perform the necessary setup to define the `model_record` variable for the shared examples:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::IssuableMetricImageReplicator do\n    let(:model_record) { build(:issuable_metric_image) }\n\n    include_examples 'a blob replicator'\n    include_examples 'a verifiable replicator'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/models/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  class Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry \u003c Geo::BaseRegistry\n    include ::Geo::ReplicableRegistry\n    include ::Geo::VerifiableRegistry\n\n    MODEL_CLASS = ::IssuableMetricImage\n    MODEL_FOREIGN_KEY = :issuable_metric_image_id\n\n    belongs_to :issuable_metric_image, class_name: 'IssuableMetricImage'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Update `REGISTRY_CLASSES` in `ee/app/workers/geo/secondary/registry_consistency_worker.rb`.\n- [ ] Add a custom factory name if needed in `def model_class_factory_name` in `ee/spec/services/geo/registry_consistency_service_spec.rb`.\n- [ ] Update `it 'creates missing registries for each registry class'` in `ee/spec/workers/geo/secondary/registry_consistency_worker_spec.rb`.\n- [ ] Add `issuable_metric_image_registry` to `ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections` in `config/initializers_before_autoloader/000_inflections.rb`.\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/factories/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  FactoryBot.define do\n    factory :geo_issuable_metric_image_registry, class: 'Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry' do\n      issuable_metric_image # This association should have data, like a file or repository\n      state { Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry.state_value(:pending) }\n\n      trait :synced do\n        state { Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry.state_value(:synced) }\n        last_synced_at { 5.days.ago }\n      end\n\n      trait :failed do\n        state { Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry.state_value(:failed) }\n        last_synced_at { 1.day.ago }\n        retry_count { 2 }\n        last_sync_failure { 'Random error' }\n      end\n\n      trait :started do\n        state { Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry.state_value(:started) }\n        last_synced_at { 1.day.ago }\n        retry_count { 0 }\n      end\n\n      trait :verification_succeeded do\n        verification_checksum { 'e079a831cab27bcda7d81cd9b48296d0c3dd92ef' }\n        verification_state { Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry.verification_state_value(:verification_succeeded) }\n        verified_at { 5.days.ago }\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/models/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistry, :geo, type: :model do\n    let_it_be(:registry) { create(:geo_issuable_metric_image_registry) }\n\n    specify 'factory is valid' do\n      expect(registry).to be_valid\n    end\n\n    include_examples 'a Geo framework registry'\n    include_examples 'a Geo verifiable registry'\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add the following to `spec/factories/issuable_metric_images.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  trait(:verification_succeeded) do\n    with_file\n    verification_checksum { 'abc' }\n    verification_state { IssuableMetricImage.verification_state_value(:verification_succeeded) }\n  end\n\n  trait(:verification_failed) do\n    with_file\n    verification_failure { 'Could not calculate the checksum' }\n    verification_state { IssuableMetricImage.verification_state_value(:verification_failed) }\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Make sure the factory also allows setting a `project` attribute. If the model does not have a direct relation to a project, you can use a `transient` attribute. Check out `spec/factories/merge_request_diffs.rb` for an example.\n\n- [ ] Following [the example of Merge Request Diffs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63309) add a `Geo::IssuableMetricImageState` model in `ee/app/models/ee/geo/issuable_metric_image_state.rb`:\n\n  ``` ruby\n  module Geo\n    class IssuableMetricImageState \u003c ApplicationRecord\n      include EachBatch\n      include ::Geo::VerificationStateDefinition\n\n      self.primary_key = :issuable_metric_image_id\n\n      belongs_to :issuable_metric_image, inverse_of: :issuable_metric_image_state\n\n      validates :verification_failure, length: { maximum: 255 }\n      validates :verification_state, :issuable_metric_image, presence: true\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add a `factory` for `issuable_metric_image_state`, in `ee/spec/factories/geo/issuable_metric_image_states.rb`:\n\n  ``` ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  FactoryBot.define do\n    factory :geo_issuable_metric_image_state, class: 'Geo::IssuableMetricImageState' do\n      issuable_metric_image\n\n      trait(:checksummed) do\n        verification_checksum { 'abc' }\n      end\n\n      trait(:checksum_failure) do\n        verification_failure { 'Could not calculate the checksum' }\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n#### Step 2. Implement metrics gathering\n\nMetrics are gathered by `Geo::MetricsUpdateWorker`, persisted in `GeoNodeStatus` for display in the UI, and sent to Prometheus:\n\n- [ ] Add the following fields to Geo Node Status example responses in `doc/api/geo_nodes.md`:\n  - `issuable_metric_images_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_checksum_total_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_checksummed_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_checksum_failed_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_synced_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_failed_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_registry_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_verification_total_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_verified_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_verification_failed_count`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_synced_in_percentage`\n  - `issuable_metric_images_verified_in_percentage`\n- [ ] Add the same fields to `GET /geo_nodes/status` example response in\n  `ee/spec/fixtures/api/schemas/public_api/v4/geo_node_status.json`.\n- [ ] Add the following fields to the `Sidekiq metrics` table in `doc/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.md`:\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_checksum_total`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_checksummed`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_checksum_failed`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_synced`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_failed`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_registry`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_verification_total`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_verified`\n  - `geo_issuable_metric_images_verification_failed`\n- [ ] Add the following to the parameterized table in the `context 'Replicator stats' do` block in `ee/spec/models/geo_node_status_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  Geo::IssuableMetricImageReplicator | :issuable_metric_image | :geo_issuable_metric_image_registry\n  ```\n\nIssuable Metric Image replication and verification metrics should now be available in the API, the `Admin \u003e Geo \u003e Nodes` view, and Prometheus.\n\n#### Step 3. Implement the GraphQL API\n\nThe GraphQL API is used by `Admin \u003e Geo \u003e Replication Details` views, and is directly queryable by administrators.\n\n- [ ] Add a new field to `GeoNodeType` in `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  field :issuable_metric_image_registries, ::Types::Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistryType.connection_type,\n        null: true,\n        resolver: ::Resolvers::Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistriesResolver,\n        description: 'Find Issuable Metric Image registries on this Geo node',\n        feature_flag: :geo_issuable_metric_image_replication\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add the new `issuable_metric_image_registries` field name to the `expected_fields` array in `ee/spec/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type_spec.rb`.\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/graphql/resolvers/geo/issuable_metric_image_registries_resolver.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Resolvers\n    module Geo\n      class IssuableMetricImageRegistriesResolver \u003c BaseResolver\n        type ::Types::Geo::GeoNodeType.connection_type, null: true\n\n        include RegistriesResolver\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/graphql/resolvers/geo/issuable_metric_image_registries_resolver_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Resolvers::Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistriesResolver do\n    it_behaves_like 'a Geo registries resolver', :geo_issuable_metric_image_registry\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/finders/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry_finder.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Geo\n    class IssuableMetricImageRegistryFinder\n      include FrameworkRegistryFinder\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/finders/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry_finder_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistryFinder do\n    it_behaves_like 'a framework registry finder', :geo_issuable_metric_image_registry\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry_type.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  module Types\n    module Geo\n      # rubocop:disable Graphql/AuthorizeTypes because it is included\n      class IssuableMetricImageRegistryType \u003c BaseObject\n        include ::Types::Geo::RegistryType\n\n        graphql_name 'IssuableMetricImageRegistry'\n        description 'Represents the Geo replication and verification state of a issuable_metric_image'\n\n        field :issuable_metric_image_id, GraphQL::ID_TYPE, null: false, description: 'ID of the Issuable Metric Image'\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Create `ee/spec/graphql/types/geo/issuable_metric_image_registry_type_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # frozen_string_literal: true\n\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  RSpec.describe GitlabSchema.types['IssuableMetricImageRegistry'] do\n    it_behaves_like 'a Geo registry type'\n\n    it 'has the expected fields (other than those included in RegistryType)' do\n      expected_fields = %i[issuable_metric_image_id]\n\n      expect(described_class).to have_graphql_fields(*expected_fields).at_least\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Add integration tests for providing IssuableMetricImage registry data to the frontend via the GraphQL API, by duplicating and modifying the following shared examples in `ee/spec/requests/api/graphql/geo/registries_spec.rb`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  it_behaves_like 'gets registries for', {\n    field_name: 'IssuableMetricImageRegistries',\n    registry_class_name: 'IssuableMetricImageRegistry',\n    registry_factory: :geo_issuable_metric_image_registry,\n    registry_foreign_key_field_name: 'IssuableMetricImageId'\n  }\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Update the GraphQL reference documentation:\n\n  ```shell\n  bundle exec rake gitlab:graphql:compile_docs\n  ```\n\nIndividual Issuable Metric Image replication and verification data should now be available via the GraphQL API.\n\n#### Step 4. Handle batch destroy\n\nIf batch destroy logic is implemented for a replicable, then that logic must be \"replicated\" by Geo secondaries. The easiest way to do this is use `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` to bulk insert a delete event for each replicable.\n\nFor example, if `FastDestroyAll` is used, then you may be able to [use `begin_fast_destroy` and `finalize_fast_destroy` hooks, like we did for uploads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69763).\n\nOr if a special service is used to batch delete records and their associated data, then you probably need to [hook into that service, like we did for job artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79530).\n\nAs illustrated by the above two examples, batch destroy logic cannot be handled automatically by Geo secondaries without restricting the way other teams perform batch destroys. It is up to you to produce `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` attributes before the records are deleted, and then enqueue `Geo::BatchEventCreateWorker` after the records are deleted.\n\n- [ ] Ensure that any batch destroy of this replicable is replicated to secondary sites\n- [ ] Regardless of implementation details, please verify in specs that when the parent object is removed, the new `Geo::Event` records are created:\n\n```ruby\n  describe '#destroy' do\n    subject { create(:issuable_metric_image) }\n\n    context 'when running in a Geo primary node' do\n      let_it_be(:primary) { create(:geo_node, :primary) }\n      let_it_be(:secondary) { create(:geo_node) }\n\n      it 'logs an event to the Geo event log when bulk removal is used', :sidekiq_inline do\n        stub_current_geo_node(primary)\n\n        expect { subject.project.destroy! }.to change(Geo::Event.where(replicable_name: :issuable_metric_image, event_name: :deleted), :count).by(1)\n\n        payload = Geo::Event.where(replicable_name: :issuable_metric_image, event_name: :deleted).last.payload\n\n        expect(payload['model_record_id']).to eq(subject.id)\n        expect(payload['blob_path']).to eq(subject.relative_path)\n        expect(payload['uploader_class']).to eq('IssuableMetricImageUploader')\n      end\n    end\n  end\n```\n\n### Release Geo support of Issuable Metric Images\n\n- [ ] In the rollout issue you created when creating the feature flag, modify the Roll Out Steps:\n  - [ ] Cross out any steps related to testing on production GitLab.com, because Geo is not running on production GitLab.com at the moment.\n  - [ ] Add a step to `Test replication and verification of Issuable Metric Images on a non-GDK-deployment. For example, using GitLab Environment Toolkit`.\n  - [ ] Add a step to `Ping the Geo PM and EM to coordinate testing`. For example, you might add steps to generate Issuable Metric Images, and then a Geo engineer may take it from there.\n- [ ] In `ee/config/feature_flags/development/geo_issuable_metric_image_replication.yml`, set `default_enabled: true`\n- [ ] In `ee/app/graphql/types/geo/geo_node_type.rb`, remove the `feature_flag` option for the released type:\n\n  ```ruby\n  field :issuable_metric_image_registries, ::Types::Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistryType.connection_type,\n        null: true,\n        resolver: ::Resolvers::Geo::IssuableMetricImageRegistriesResolver,\n        description: 'Find Issuable Metric Image registries on this Geo node',\n        feature_flag: :geo_issuable_metric_image_replication # REMOVE THIS LINE\n  ```\n\n- [ ] Run `bundle exec rake gitlab:graphql:compile_docs` after the step above to regenerate the GraphQL docs.\n\n- [ ] Add a row for Issuable Metric Images to the `Data types` table in [Geo data types support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.md#data-types)\n- [ ] Add a row for Issuable Metric Images to the `Limitations on replication/verification` table in [Geo data types support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.md#limitations-on-replicationverification). If the row already exists, then update it to show that Replication and Verification is released in the current version.\n\nRelated to

request","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen using GitLab's GraphQL API to query for pipelines of more than one merge request at once, GitLab will return the same list of pipelines for each merge request.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nGo to https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer and execute this query:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  project(fullPath: \"gitlab-org/gitlab\") {\n    mergeRequests(iids: [\"47250\", \"47251\"]) {\n      nodes {\n        id\n        title\n        pipelines(first: 1) {\n          nodes {\n            id\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example Project\n\nReproduced on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThis is the query result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"project\": {\n      \"mergeRequests\": {\n        \"nodes\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/MergeRequest/77504100\",\n            \"title\": \"Add note for jest spec best practices\",\n            \"pipelines\": {\n              \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                  \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/Ci::Pipeline/215473328\"\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/MergeRequest/77503306\",\n            \"title\": \"Docs: Edited Go Proxy topic\",\n            \"pipelines\": {\n              \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                  \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/Ci::Pipeline/215473328\"\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the same pipeline, `gid://gitlab/Ci::Pipeline/215473328`, is provided as a result for both merge requests.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI expect this result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"project\": {\n      \"mergeRequests\": {\n        \"nodes\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/MergeRequest/77504100\",\n            \"title\": \"Add note for jest spec best practices\",\n            \"pipelines\": {\n              \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                  \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/Ci::Pipeline/215473328\"\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/MergeRequest/77503306\",\n            \"title\": \"Docs: Edited Go Proxy topic\",\n            \"pipelines\": {\n              \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                  \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/Ci::Pipeline/214196176\"\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that each merge request has a different pipeline associated with it.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nSee code blocks above.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI am not familiar with this code, so I don't know.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-16T22:40:43.682Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T14:07:45.293Z","closed_at":"2022-05-19T14:52:42.619Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex

 View and update weight","description":"## Problem\n\n1. Several customers have vocalized the desire to add weight directly to an epic. This is useful when doing ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) estimation before an epic is decomposed into smaller vertical slices and estimated by a development team. \n1. As we move towards work items with Tasks as the first step, users will naturally want to be able to set a weight on a Task. Given that issues already have `weight` as a field, we need to consider how weight ought to behave within this new model. \n\n## Proposal\n\n- A user can set a numeric weight on any work item into an `Weight` field.\n\nIn the example below, `Tasks` do not have a weight field.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\nWe started off with showing shared runner usage data to users by adding a `Shared runner usage` tab under Group \u003e\u003eAnalytics\u003e\u003eCI/CD page. Later, after understanding that analytics is a paid feature, we decided to show the information on the Group Settings\u003e\u003eShared runner usage page through https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355666.\n\nNow the same information is available at 2 places\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nThe `Shared runner usage` info for group  should be displayed in the same way as for namespace, under settings\u003e\u003eusage quota page. Not under the Analytics\u003e\u003eCI/CD.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove `Shared runner usage` tab from under Analytics\u003e\u003eCI/CD\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members\n\nPlease consider performing a threat model for the code changes that are introduced as part of this feature.

Here is [an example](https://storage.googleapis.com/sitespeed-results-gitlab/sourcecode-repo_browser_js/2022-04-13-09-52-18/scripts.html). You can script the behavior of visiting multiple pages, clicking links, and performing any action you wish.\n\u003e \n\u003e ### Purpose\n\u003e \n\u003e The purpose of this issue is to iterate on how we measure performance.  We want to monitor the performance of a complete user journey (workflow).  \n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e ### What am I being asked to do?\n\u003e \n\u003e - [ ] 1. Identify the top 3 or 5 most popular User worklows\n\u003e - [ ] 2. Identify the 3 to 5 slowest User workflows\n\u003e - [ ] 3. Identify logic that is used in multiple places that if improved would deliver a more **far reaching positive performance improvement**  \n\u003e - [ ] 4. Work with PM and UX to determine the User Journey to script for this OKR based on what was identified in (1-3 above)\n\u003e - [ ] 5. Run the script for 3 runs and share the results in this issue\n\u003e - [ ] 6. Create an issue that investigates opportunities for performance improvements for the slowest step(s)\n\u003e \n\u003e ### Example of a User Journey (Workflow)\n\u003e \n\u003e Measure the total time for this workflow:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. User clicks on a repository\n\u003e 2. User makes a change\n\u003e 3. User opens an MR\n\u003e 4. User clicks Merge \n\u003e \n\u003e The goal is to measure the time it takes for each step and try to identify which steps are the slowest steps in the process and determine whether or not we dan optimize those steps.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-16T14:58:43.785Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T12:01:22.619Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T07:42:25.402Z","closed_by":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","performance-refinement","section::dev","tooling","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"}],"author":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362512","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362512","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362512/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362512/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#362512","relative":"#362512","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#362512"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":108620693,"iid":362509,"project_id":278964,"title":"Issue any http requests when users view an openapi document and click on buttons","description":"**[HackerOne report #1563383](https://hackerone.com/reports/1563383)** by `yvvdwf` on 2022-05-09, assigned to @kmorrison1:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nHello,\n\nThe santization of a swagger openapi viewer does not exclude `form` tag. Consequently attackers may introduce a `form` which allows to send arbitrary POST requests to the server. PUT, DELETE, PATH requests can be achieved by setting value of`_method` field.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. In an existing project or create a new one, add a file, `openapi-form.yml` (you can change the basename but it needs to contain `openapi` word and the `.yml` extension is important) with the following content:  \n```yaml  \nopenapi: 3.0.0  \ninfo:  \n  title: Sample API  \nservers:  \n  - url: /api/v4  \npaths:  \n  /users/5212593:  \n    put:  \n      description: Click `Try it out` then `Execute` buttons to get bounty.  \n      operationId: api  \n      parameters:  \n        - name: admin  \n          value: true\n\n```  \n2. After committing the file, view it and click on `Try it out` then `Execute` buttons. You will see a POST request to `/api/v4/users/5212593`. This is an example to escalate my account as Admin.\n\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAttackers may trick users to perform unattended actions, such as (1) add attackers to Admin or a private group, (2) add attackers' SSH key, etc.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nThis example is in private mode, please tell me if you cannot access: https://gitlab.com/yvvdwf/xss/-/blob/master/openapi-form.yml#/default/api\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe sanitization does not exclude `form` tag\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe `form` tag should be excluded\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nAttackers may trick users to perform unattended actions, such as (1) add attackers to Admin or a private group, (2) add attackers' SSH key, etc.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_2022-05-09_at_13.45.59.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/b082561f-6380-4e9c-8c39-f4a322880f33/Screenshot_2022-05-09_at_13.45.59.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-16T14:38:48.310Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T12:04:54.484Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T18:02:34.469Z","closed_by":{"id":4019091,"username":"djadmin","name":"Dheeraj Joshi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/57dccb416bfcfac947a69c53c5585128?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djadmin"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-79","bug::vulnerability","devops::secure","frontend","group::dynamic analysis","priority::3","section::sec","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":4019091,"username":"djadmin","name":"Dheeraj Joshi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/57dccb416bfcfac947a69c53c5585128?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djadmin"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4019091,"username":"djadmin","name":"Dheeraj Joshi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/57dccb416bfcfac947a69c53c5585128?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djadmin"},"user_notes_count":50,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-07-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362509","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362509","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362509/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/362509/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#362509","relative":"#362509","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#362509"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":108620466,"iid":362508,"project_id":278964,"title":"Navbar search field does not expand properly when user is not logged in","description":"### Summary\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84187 we introduced a change to expand the navbar search field on focus to provide the user with additional room with searches.

View a page where the search bar is present while not logged in\n2. Focus the search field\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nThe search field does not stay right aligned to the content while growing in size when focused.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nThe search field should remain anchored to the right and grow in size to the left (matching how it functions for logged in users).\n\n\n#### Additional considerations\nSince we also have less content in the navbar for non-logged in users, we can also consider not hiding the logo/menu for smaller screens like we do now. However, I'm thinking we should probably wait and handle that in a separate issue once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/86348 has been decided/merged, as that will change the

updated to `operational` category. \n\n-  **Business Justification:** To better support the current CS services provided to the field, and to be more consistent in collecting usage data from all types of customers, SM \u0026 SaaS.\n- **Why does CS need this:** This will allow for further analysis into feature usage for our SM customers and help us become consistent with the usage data we collect for SaaS customers.\n- **How will this be used:** Once these metrics are classified as `operational`, it will allow us to collect usage from our SM customers on cloud licensing, and therefore help us build additional reporting to analyze SM customer usage of Gitlab features.\n\n\n## Approval\nApproved by Operational Metrics DRI here:

flag] Rollout of `ci_show_all_projects_with_usage_sorted_descending`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout the update (gitlab#195487) to show the projects list sorted by amount_used on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_show_all_projects_with_usage_sorted_descending` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline execution\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-execution`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @ffarukh @katrinleinweber @fabiopitino \n- PM: @jheimbuck_gl\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nUsage Quotas page to display the following improvements to the breakdown of the usage by project:\n\n|Before | After |\n| --- | --- |\n| Projects in sub-groups not displayed | Projects in sub-groups are displayed |\n| Projects were not sorted | Projects sorted by highest consumption first |\n| All projects shows (including irrelevant) | Projects with 0 usage are filtered out |\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nFeature implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83680 is immediately viable.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n* We may see unexpected errors in Sentry \n* We may see unexpected increase in database time filtering and sorting the data on large groups.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n* Unexpected errors in https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+UsageQuotasController related to the Usage Quotas page\n* Performance of `Groups::UsageQuotasController` https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/87c67ac0-d814-11ec-aade-19e9974a7229\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\nSame as above\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_show_all_projects_with_usage_sorted_descending false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-13T08:38:15.257Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T13:25:53.853Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T13:25:53.825Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio
