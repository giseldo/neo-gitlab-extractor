Lately we've added the ability to override variables in a job, In this release, we've extended this ability so you can now decide if certain conditions are met and subsequently override pipeline variables, providing you with more flexibility when configuring your pipelines.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nRules define when certain jobs can be run, but they could also provide overrides for configuration. This would be a handy way to set up rules for when certain policies or variables should be set. One example use case would be making cache-policy settable by “rules” to say for example that you only want to update the cache pull-push on master and not on branches. Another could be setting `interruptible` using various rules.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn this issue, we only add `variables` to the workflow `rules`.\n\nAdd `variables` to rules to specify variables.

This can help you by decreasing your reliance on external dependencies and decrease your average build times. \n\nThe problem is that if you continue to use the feature the cache will begin to fill up with a lot of stale data. You can always clear the cache using the [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dependency_proxy.html). But GitLab should have a standard TTL and eviction policy for clearing the cache so that we don't waste money on storage. \n\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a daily job that will remove all artifacts from the Dependency Proxy that are more than 90 days old. \n\n#### Why this is important\n\nWe are actively discussing how to grow adoption of this feature, including expanding the scope to allow for pulling container images from Amazon (ECR) and Google's (GCR) container registries. This could result in many more images being added to the cache and object storage. \n\nWhen a new/unknown artifact is cached at time `T`, set its TTL to `T+90`. The artifact should be removed from the cache after 90 days. \n\n#### Why 90 days\n\nI chose 90 days because that is the most common setting for the Container Registry cleanup policy, as seen in the pie chart below. Also, the majority of policies are set up to run daily. \n\n![CleanuppoliciesCadenceusageping](/uploads/4e1835f70f83d7d91699bf3eebf240eb/CleanuppoliciesCadenceusageping.png)\n![Cleanuppoliciessettingsofdaystoremoveimagesusageping__2_](/uploads/0dda240bfc404fbd2273d92bde2b8ce6/Cleanuppoliciessettingsofdaystoremoveimagesusageping__2_.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-16T23:35:27.069Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T23:00:26.097Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T19:43:53.190Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Proxy","Deliverable","Package:P1","backend","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","reliability","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":37,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/294187","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/294187","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/294187/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/294187/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#294187","relative":"#294187","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#294187"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76159983,"iid":294185,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Add filter to hide dismissed alerts\"","description":"The following discussion from !49975 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @ohoral started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49975#note_468500175): \n\n    \u003e it is advised against testing vm properties.

Even in such a scenario, following risks are present:\n\n1. Abuse of the Gitlab instance as a proxy to port scan remote targets (I know there are a lot of such proxies out there, but still there should at least be an option to disallow this)\n\n2. Disclosure of origin IP address + User agent of Gitlab instance when its running behind a load  balancer or services like Cloudflare for DDoS protection.\n\nTherefore, I think this endpoint should not be public by default and enforcing authentication might be a good idea allowing a toggle to disable it if one is aware of potential risks here.\n\nThanks!\n\n####  Impact\n\n- Origin IP address

recently [uses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/899cc9b0a475fd247b3d9003f855df3876e853f1/app/assets/javascripts/notebook/cells/output/html.vue#L29) `Dompurify` to sanitize data. Dompurify allows `data-*` attributes by default. When using `data-*` attributes with the presence of  `rails-ujs`,   attackers might trick victims to execute any javascript.\n\nThe following attack scenario triggers an alert when you click anywhere on the blob viewer screen of notebooks. Since gitlab allows sending API requests via Javascript in Web browsers, attackers may perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims, such as, escalate permissions, access to private objects, etc.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. In a project, create a file `xss.ipynb` with the following content (**note** edited with a known safe payload):\n\n```JSON  \n{\n \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [  \n  {  \n   \u0026#34;cell_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;markdown\u0026#34;,  \n   \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: [  \n        \u0026#34;\u0026lt;a data-type=script data-remote=true href=\u0026#39;https://gitlab.com/ankelly/pipeline_payload/-/jobs/[REDACTED]/artifacts/raw/data/alert.js\u0026#39; style=\u0026#39;position:fixed;z-index:9999;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;CLICK ANYWHERE TO SHOW POPUP\u0026#34;  \n   ]  \n  }]  \n}\n```\n\n2. When viewing this file, you might notice that there exists a transparent layer that is on the topmost. This layer intercepts any event clicks. Once you click *anywhere* you should see a popup.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nOnce victims click anywhere on the screen of notebook viewer, attackers might execute their javascript. Since gitlab allows sending API requests via Javascript in Web browsers, attackers may perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims, such as, escalate permissions, access to private objects, etc.\n\n#####  Examples\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/yvvdwf/notebook/-/blob/master/xss.ipynb\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`data-*` attributes  are not removed when sanitizing.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`data-*` attributes  should be removed when sanitizing.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nOnce victims click anywhere on the screen of notebook viewer, attackers might execute their javascript. Since gitlab allows sending API requests via Javascript in Web browsers, attackers may perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims, such as, escalate permissions, access to private objects, etc.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-16T19:29:11.917Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T12:38:30.160Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T06:34:49.564Z","closed_by":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-79","devops::create","frontend","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-03-16","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/294128","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/294128","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/294128/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/294128/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#294128","relative":"#294128","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#294128"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76153786,"iid":294126,"project_id":278964,"title":"Encountering `Projects::UpdateRepositoryStorageService::SameFilesystemError` when excluding `destination_storage_name` parameter","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n\nNels update 2020-12-16:\n\nSearched for: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all\u0026utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026state=all\u0026label_name[]=bug\u0026search=SameFilesystemError\n\nResults: 0\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nEncountering `Projects::UpdateRepositoryStorageService::SameFilesystemError` when excluding `destination_storage_name` parameter when invoking a `POST` request to the `projects/\u003cproject_id\u003e/repository_storage_moves` API.\n\nSource: [Sentry.gitlab.net](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/staginggitlabcom/issues/2407090/?query=is%3Aunresolved)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important.

Care should be taken to ensure that the selection algorithm also use the `filesystem_id` for destination candidates when comparing them against the source shard.\n\nA simple filter ought to be sufficient.  Something like the following: `candidates_sans_source = candidate_destination_shards.reject_if { |destination_candidate_shard| Gitlab::GitalyClient.filesystem_id(destination_candidate_shard) == Gitlab::GitalyClient.filesystem_id(repository_storage_move.project.respository_storage) }`\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/projects/update_repository_storage_service.rb#L22\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/application_setting_implementation.rb#L329\n\nThe implementation found in the latter: `normalized_repository_storage_weights.max_by { |_, weight| rand**(1.0 / weight) }.first` appears to present a challenge to the approach of filtering by a normalization on `filesystem_id`, since the `pick_repository_storage` routine is ignoring the application setting key.  The filter operation may have to target the values for the `normalized_repository_storage_weights` mapping, but that could be complicated since the filtering apparatus described in the proposed above relies on methods (like `Gitlab::GitalyClient#filesystem_id`) and a `repository_storage_move.project.respository_storage` parameter which are not available to `ApplicationSettingImplementation#pick_repository_storage`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-16T19:23:48.877Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T10:39:56.190Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T21:25:18.761Z","closed_by":{"id":228150,"username":"proglottis","name":"James

It currently use `Dompurify` to allow only `\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;` tag and [*all DOM attributes*](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a73629186ff0b6469a3c794f11c13bee7ae3b8e0/ee/app/assets/javascripts/audit_events/components/table_cells/html_table_cell.vue#L16) of this tag. This allows attackers to introduce any DOM attributes and when combining with other existing javascript functions on gitlab, attackers might trick victims to do any  PUT requests. \n\nThe following attack scenario allows setting a normal account as administrator.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n**as Attackers**\n\n1.  In any existing project, or create a new project, go to `Operations/Feature Flags`, click `New feature flag` button.  \n2. Fill the form in `New feature flag` as the following:\n\n- Name: `XSS` (or anything, it is not important)  \n- Description: `\u0026lt;strong style=\u0026#34;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:99999\u0026#34; data-url=\u0026#34;/api/v4/users/USER_ID?admin=true\u0026#34; class=js-usage-consent-action\u0026gt;`. In the url above, please replace `USER_ID` by your user ID that is existing  in your gitlab instance.  \n- Click `Create feature flag` to save the flag\n\n**as Admin**  \n1. Go to `Admin area/Monitoring/Audit log`.  After opening the `Audit log`, you might notice that there exists a transparent layer on the topmost. That layer intercept any click events.  \n2. Click anywhere (to set the attacker as administrator)\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAttackers might use this vulnerable to escalate permission.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe descriptions of feature flags are not sanitized correctly.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAny DOM attributes of `\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;` tags in the description of feature flags should be eliminated.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:  \n`sudo gitlab-rake

needs to re-review the updates to make sure they meet the project standards and can be approved.\n\nCurrently, the only way to accomplish this would be requiring the reviewer to remove themselves and re-add them, or ping them in a comment inside of GitLab (or outside) to request this.\n\nThese are prone to error and unclear behavior on what the specific ask of the reviewer is.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWhen reviewers are assigned, authors should have the ability to request a re-review of their contribution. This would provide a notification to the reviewer(s) via email and To-Do so that they know they need to look at a Merge Request again.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-15T21:57:00.331Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T09:08:21.152Z","closed_at":"2021-02-09T08:33:52.533Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","GitLab Core","Technical Writing","UX","devops::create","direction","docs::feature","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::code review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"}],"author":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293933","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293933","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293933/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293933/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#293933","relative":"#293933","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#293933"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5074,"epic":{"id":163755,"iid":5074,"title":"MR Reviewer Handoff and Workflow","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5074","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76105566,"iid":293932,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update Cilium agent module to support L7 rules","description":"Implementation plan:\n -

first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nRemove the `Total duration` statistic from the `Project -\u003e Analytics -\u003e CI/CD` page\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-12-15_at_11.53.51](/uploads/2a0f29bb437e986e387f501d92348c24/Screen_Shot_2020-12-15_at_11.53.51.png)\n\n\n### Further details\n\nAs part of our current efforts to reduce the LCP (Largest Content Paint) metrics across GitLab, the Analytics -\u003e CI/CD page current has among the highest LCP numbers, and while https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48267 has helped reduced this number a bit, on production the \"Total duration\" metric it's causing a 500 error due to significant amount of time that the query needs to run on the GitLab project. Smaller projects are unaffected if the number of pipelines are low but as the number of pipelines increases, the query will start taking significantly more time until it times out.\n\nThe proposed solution involves removing this metric from both the frontend and backend, since there's no easy way to calculate this metric even with optimizations to it.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThis is part of a workstream to automate iteration cadences and support more flexibility for teams that share projects. The full problem statement can be found here -- https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5077#problems-to-solve\n\n### Proposal\n\n- BE\n  - handle automatic creation of iterations within a cadences\n    - have a background job that generates future iterations based on future iterations setting\n  - when the option to automatically roll open issues from a closed iteration to the next iteration is enabled, automatically move open issues to the next iteration and ensure the `relative_position` of all issues rolling over is higher than the other issues that are also in the next iteration. \n   - background job tied to iteration close event to move issues to next iteration\n* FE\n  * handle iteration source change\n    * dropdown to pick new iterations source\n    * UI/UX to handle the change of the source, maybe some wizard to map iterations from one source to another to allow for issues migration ?\n\nThis is the third step towards https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5077#note_467401527\n\n### Further details\n\nAllows historical data to be migrated into the project from external services.\n\n### UX \u0026 Vertical Feature Slices\n\n![New_cadence_-_automated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/77ceb6ad6e77ea26c08ef7a93ed9d9df/New_cadence_-_automated.png)\n\n* [ ] I can disable `Automated Scheduling` (default to enabled)\n* [ ] If `Automated Scheduled` is disabled, I cannot change or interact with any other fields except `Description`, `Name`, and `Roll Over Issues`.\n* [ ] I can enter the start date for the first Iteration.\n* [ ] I can select the duration (in weeks) for each Iteration within my cadence from a drop down list with values of `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`\n* [ ] I can select the number of future iterations i want to always have automatically scheduled from a list with the following values -- `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, or `10`\n* [ ] All fields are required except `Description` and `Roll Over Issues`, when `Automated Scheduling` is enabled. When it is disabled, only `Name` is required. `Roll Over Issues` and `Automated Scheduling` is enabled by default for new cadences. For existing cadences, `Roll Over Issues` is enabled by default.  \n* [ ] When `Automated Scheduling` is enabled and the required fields are defined, I can either click a button to create the cadence or to cancel the creation process.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-15T17:02:05.949Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:00:24.630Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T12:21:45.502Z","closed_by":{"id":5965371,"username":"jlear","name":"Jake Lear","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5965371/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jlear"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","GitLab Starter","Next Up","Technical Writing","backend","devops::plan","direction","documentation","frontend","group::project management","missed:13.11","missed:13.12","missed:14.0","missed:14.1","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","section::dev","tw-weight::5","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"}],"author":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"user_notes_count":45,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293867","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":13,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 13 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293867","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293867/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293867/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#293867","relative":"#293867","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#293867"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5077,"epic":{"id":163847,"iid":5077,"title":"Support multiple, automated Iteration Cadences","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5077","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76097010,"iid":293865,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document docker-in-docker usage for API Fuzzing","description":"### Problem\n\nAPI Fuzzing CI Template supports a docker-in-docker usage model that has not been documented.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDocument the docker-in-docker variables and provide an example project.\n\nTasks:\n\n1.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\nWhen you are troubleshooting a pipeline that is behaving unexpectedly you may want to look at all the jobs with a particular status. That would require looking at the full list of jobs or using the GitLab API to get all the data and manipulate it outside the application which is a bad workflow and takes you out of GitLab where you can fix the issue.\n\nNow you can filter for Job Status directly on the Job Page so you can see all jobs with the same status in GitLab.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nUsers are expecting the same experience as the [Pipelines page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines), where they can filter or search pipelines by: \n\n- User/Trigger \n- Branch name \n- Tag name \n- Status \n- Source  \n\nthe [Jobs page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs) has no search or filtering capability, making it difficult to search for occurrences of a specific job in case of troubleshooting.\n\n### User experience goal\n\nAdd Job Status filtering capabilities in the Jobs index page.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow user filter by Job status on [Jobs page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs):\n\n### Documentation\n\nYes, we will need additional documentation \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT

aren't `master` and were not getting any data in the .csv download for [group code coverage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#repositories-analytics).\n\n### Problem\n\nWe fixed our existing ~bug by fetching our daily coverage for the default branch.\n\nThis is quite slow today according to our [SQL query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49630#query-2-default_branch-true-new).\n\n### Solution\n\nWe have an [existing index](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/db/structure.sql#L20931) which will improve the ~performance of this ~feature that we **must use**.\n\nI think this is the time to refactor our [DailyBuildGroupReportResultsFinder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/finders/ci/daily_build_group_report_results_finder.rb) by making it more flexible:\n\nThis will help us to get rid of [DailyBuildGroupReportResultsByGroupFinder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/finders/ci/daily_build_group_report_results_by_group_finder.rb) and unify our business logic at a central place by following existing patterns we have today ([ProjectsFinder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/finders/projects_finder.rb)).\n\nHere a proposal for it:\n\n```ruby\ndef initialize(params: {}, current_user: nil)\n  @params = params\n  @current_user = current_user\nend\n\ndef execute\n  return none unless query_allowed?\n\n  collection = Ci::DailyBuildGroupReportResult.recent_results(query_params, limit: params[:limit])\n  collection = filter_report_results(collection)\nend\n\nprivate\n\ndef filter_report_results(collection)\n  collection = by_coverage(collection)\n  collection = by_projects_ids(collection)\n  collection = by_ref_path(collection)\n  collection = by_date(collection)\n  collection\nend\n\ndef by_coverage(items)\n  items.with_coverage\nend\n\ndef by_projects_ids(items)\n  params[:project_ids].present? ? items.by_projects(params[:project_ids]) : items\nend\n\ndef by_ref_path(items)\n  params[:ref_path].present? ? items.where(ref_path: params[:ref_path]) : items.with_default_branch\nend\n\ndef by_date(items)\n  params[:start_date].present? ? items.by_date(params[:start_date]) :

secure analyzer projects to use consistent QA expectation location","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nSecure analyzers currently store expectation files in `qa/expect/\u003cproject-name\u003e-\u003cbranch-name\u003e`, for example:\n\n[`qa/expect/typescript-yarn-tsx`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/eslint/-/blob/8a7698b6baf5f8a521e59de84531233161e195d0/.gitlab-ci.yml#L57)\n\nThe above expectation is located in `typescript-yarn-tsx`, where `typescript-yarn` is the test project name and the branch is `tsx-FREEZE`.\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to formally document a naming convention in the `README.md` for the [tests/common](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/common/#secure-analyzers) project, as well as update all existing dependency scanning and SAST analyzers to use this pattern.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Proposal\n\nDetermine the best location pattern to use. Currently we're using `qa/expect/\u003cproject-name\u003e-\u003cbranch-name\u003e`, however, this naming convention is ambiguous. For example, if we consider the path `java-maven-cli-opts`, it's not possible to know if the project name is `java-maven-cli` and the branch name is `opts` or if the project is `java-maven` and the branch is `cli-opts`. For this reason, I would prefer to use the pattern `\u003cproject-name\u003e/\u003cbranch-name\u003e`, which in this case would result in the unambiguous pattern `java-maven/cli-opts`.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nUse the following expectation location pattern:\n\n* `qa/expect/\u003cproject-name\u003e/gl-\u003creport_type\u003e-report.json` for the default branch and default test case\n* `qa/expect/\u003cproject-name\u003e/\u003cbranch-name|test-case\u003e/gl-\u003creport_type\u003e-report.json` for a specific branch and/or a specific test case\n\nEnsure the QA tests of the following projects use the provided expectation location pattern:\n\n- [ ] ~~SAST~~\n   -

Also, since the addition of filters/facets for some of these content types (ex: Issues/MRs) in a left sidebar, this has caused a shift in page layout based on which content type is selected (when no filters exist for a content type the layout goes full width). It would also be ideal to have all filters/facets (including content types) in a shared region of the page.\n\n### Proposal\nTransition the current content type tabs to be navigation elements within the left sidebar.

This contradiction leads to disabling DNS rebinding attack protection, thus exposing local networks. Let\u0026#39;s me detail.\n\n`Outbound Requests` setting allows requests to certain domains and local IP addresses that hooks and services may access while maintain DNS rebinding attack protection with the others. For example, in the following setting, we want to allow to access to only `192.168.0.120` and prohibit from accessing the other local IP addresses.\n\n{{Image: Please see `outbound-requests-setting.png`}}\n\nHowever this is not the case in the implementation of `validate!` function: Once the admin allows a local IP address, attackers may access any other local IPs.\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n_As Administrator_:\n\n Go to `Admin Area/Settings/Network`, then `Outbound Requests` section. Set the parameters in this section as in the image, Ex:\n\n- Allow requests to the local network from web hooks and services: No  \n- Allow requests to the local network from system hooks: No  \n- Local IP addresses and domain names that hooks and services may access:  `192.168.0.120`  \n- Enforce DNS rebinding attack protection: **YES**  \n- Click `Save changes`\n\n_As attacker_\n\nIn an existing project, or create a new project, go to `Settings/Webhooks`. Set the parameters in Webhooks as the following:\n\n- URL: `http://a.192.168.0.120.3times.127.0.0.1.1time.repeat.gitlab.dyn.yvvdwf.me:9121/scrape?target=unix:///var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket\u0026amp;check-keys=*`  \n- The other parameters are not important, you can ignore them.  \n- Click `Add webhook`  \n- After being saved, in the `Project Hooks (1)` area, click `Test/Push events`.  \n- You should see the entire Redis content as result, otherwise, if you got errors, click `Test/Push events`again to retry.   \n- The interval between success and fail tests depends on DNS cache. You should change the local default DNS resolver to `8.8.8.8`, for example, set `nameserver 8.8.8.8` as content of `/etc/resolve.conf`\n\n{{Image: Please see `retry-rquests-when-fail.png `}}\n\n_Note_\n\nAttacker can be aware about local IP `192.168.0.120` by automatically trying one by one. There are [about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network) 18M local IP addresses. If he can probe 3 IPs per seconds, he needs 18M/3/3600/24 = ~70 days. He can easily reduce this since nothing prevents him from creating 10 different accounts and 10 checking threads running in parallel for each account. This probing time increases if administrator add a port number together with IP addresses.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nOnce administrator allows *only* one local IP address, attackers may have **full** access to any other local IP addresses. \n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nI think that the bug is in [validate!](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f6ffe2d82963643d4f7b360a9eb1c59dd181ad63/lib/gitlab/url_blocker.rb) function:\n\n```ruby  \naddress_info = get_address_info(uri,

[uri, nil] unless address_info\n\nip_address = ip_address(address_info)  \n-return [uri, nil] if domain_allowed?(uri) || ip_allowed?(ip_address, port: get_port(uri))  \n+return [uri, nil] if domain_allowed?(uri)\n\nprotected_uri_with_hostname = enforce_uri_hostname(ip_address, uri, dns_rebind_protection)\n\n+return protected_uri_with_hostname if ip_allowed?(ip_address, port: get_port(uri))  \n```\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:  \n`sudo gitlab-rake

to that pipeline run. In version previous to 13.6.2, variables could be set with a null value. Now, in 13.6.2, variables added with no value assigned appear to no get applied to the pipeline. I have conditions for some jobs that simply check:\n\n```\nrules:\n    - if: '$RUN_ALL_CHECKS != null'\n```\n\nIf variables are applied with a value, then they appear in the pipeline.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nManually create a pipeline, add a variable with no value. Variable does not appear applied to pipeline or the jobs.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNo variable applied\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nVariable applied with no value\n\n### Proposal \n\nI would change the filter function to not filter out variables that do not have a value. Since it seems some users rely on that.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-14T17:07:30.272Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T07:07:23.431Z","closed_at":"2021-04-30T13:22:49.019Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["CI variables","Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","approaching-SLO","automation:ml","automation:ml wrong","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","missed-SLO","priority::3","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"}],"author":{"id":4125953,"username":"trickyhead","name":"Richard Head","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/51ced0e20428ba797cbd434724dc2e83?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trickyhead"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293700","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293700","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293700/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293700/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#293700","relative":"#293700","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#293700"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5124,"epic":{"id":175714,"iid":5124,"title":"Bugs: Variables","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5124","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":76044859,"iid":293697,"project_id":278964,"title":"x.509-signed commits to not display as \"Verified\"/\"Unverified\" as do GPG-signed commits","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

Analytics side bar link and -/analytics redirect don't match","description":"### Summary\n\nOn a Group page, clicking the **Analytics** link in the sidebar navigates to the **Value Stream Analytics** page (for example: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/value_stream_analytics?created_after=2020-11-14\u0026created_before=2020-12-13\u0026value_stream_id=531).\n\nHowever, navigating directly to `https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics` redirects to the **Contribution Analytics** page (for example: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/contribution_analytics).\n\nIntuitively, the sidebar link and the `-/analytics` redirect should point to the same page.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Navigate to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org and click the **Analytics** sidebar link\n   - This will navigate you to the **Value Stream Analytics** page: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/value_stream_analytics?created_after=2020-11-14\u0026created_before=2020-12-13\u0026value_stream_id=531\n- Paste `https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/` into your browser's address bar\n   - This will navigate you to the **Contribution Analytics** page: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/contribution_analytics\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nA few possible fixes:\n\n1. Update the `-/analytics` redirect to instead point to the **Value Stream Analytics**\n   - **Pros:** Very easy. Consistent with the decision made in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210317 (and implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/27277)\n   - **Cons:** Reinforces an inconsistency. Currently, all other sidebar links point to the _first_ sub-item. The **Analytics** sidebar item is the only exception.\n1. Update the **Analytics** sidebar item to point to the **Contribution Analytics** page\n   - **Pros:** Consistent with the rest of the sidebar design\n   - **Cons:** Undoes the decision made in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210317 (and implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/27277)\n1. Do \u003cspan\u003e#\u003c/span\u003e1, and also move the **Value Stream Analytics** subitem to the top of the list.\n   - **Pros:** Consistent with current sidebar design, and doesn't undo https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210317\n   - **Cons:** This option seems to have already been considered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210317#note_306326669, and decided against for some reason :thinking:","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-14T15:24:43.524Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T21:02:54.632Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T20:38:45.959Z","closed_by":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","backend","devops::manage","group::optimize","priority::4","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"}],"author":{"id":493585,"username":"nfriend","name":"Nathan Friend","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cd23f74a33fc7d8dfe081948696551a5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nfriend"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4512390,"username":"djensen","name":"Dan Jensen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4512390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/djensen"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293689","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293689","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293689/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/293689/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#293689","relative":"#293689","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#293689"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76039601,"iid":293685,"project_id":278964,"title":"Many environments strategies break the row","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nReproducible on `.com` When adding many long environment strategies to a Feature Flag the tokens are displayed weirdly.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important.

Trace polling was kicked off before a job was started and if visibility was hidden. This caused a great deal of strain on Redis. This has now been fixed. Although it introduced a UI regression where if you cancel a job and then retry it, the job trace is not fetched immediately. The user will have to refresh the UI one time to get the job trace and kick off polling. This can be seen in the below video.\n\n![cancel-retry-trace-bug](/uploads/b9b8e4b0ec5f6e58befa3aaa1fe0781f/cancel-retry-trace-bug.mov)\n\n### Bug Theory\n\nWe now check a jobs state before kicking off trace polling. Meaning if the job has not started or does not have a trace, we do not start trace polling. When you cancel a job then retry a job you are redirected to the same view (current implementation). Most likely on that redirect your job will be in a pending state, which means we will not kick off trace polling (because the job has not started). I suspect the previous implementation of always trace polling no matter the jobs state was to prevent issues like this but we don't want to do that because of the server resources it will eat up.\n\n### Related MRs up to this point\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48516\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49752\n\n### Potential solution\n\nLet's revert the work done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48516 \u0026\u0026 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49752 and move back to polling the trace endpoint all the time to prevent race conditions.

These variables can be instance, group, or project CI/CD variables. This improvement provides you with more flexibility to define pipelines. You can copy the same `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to multiple projects and use variables to alter its behavior. This allows for less duplication in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and reduces the need for complicated per-project configuration. \n\n\n### Problem\nCurrently we don't expand some variables before sending them to the runner\ne.g. An environment URL that uses multi-level variable dependencies. E.g. in the example below, `environment.url` currently resolves to `https://${STACK_NAME}.example.com` instead of `https://appname-my-test-branch.example.com` when `CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG=my-test-branch`:\n\n```yaml\n.deploy:\n  environment:\n    name: ${ENVIRONMENT_NAME}\n    url: https://${MAIN_DOMAIN}\n  variables:\n    MAIN_DOMAIN: ${STACK_NAME}.example.com\n    STACK_NAME: appname-${ENVIRONMENT_NAME}\n\nproduction:\n  extends: .deploy\n  variables:\n    ENVIRONMENT_NAME: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}\n```\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\u003c!--\nA brief explanation of the why, not the what or how.
