Description\n\nThere's a lot of technical debt in our CSS. The preferred way to pay this off is by migrating CSS classes to utility classes. This also forces us to use a strict range of values.\n\nLet's clean up the styles for `frequent-items-` classes by using utility classes in their stead. This should also solve the problem describes in the [Problem Context](#problem-context) section. \n\nThis will be much easier to do once we remove the `combined_menu` feature flag https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324086.\n\n## Investigation\n\n- Here's where most of these classes are [defined](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/2f6ef640ebdfb586d2c6b07b1a1ca8688df0e969/app/assets/stylesheets/framework/dropdowns.scss#L839).\n- Here's the [Vue app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/1876d8dde1db7e1e2b6af6698ed8177c05beed5f/app/assets/javascripts/frequent_items/components/app.vue#L126) where we use most of these classes.\n\n## Problem Context\n\n### Summary\n\nAs reported in the [feedback issue for the top navigation menu](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332635#note_608384748), there is a mixture of `rem` and `px` based units in the stylesheet that seems to be causing unexpected scroll behavior in the menu container for some browsers using non-standard font sizes. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open the `Menu`\n1. Navigate to Projects\n\nIf there are several frequently used projects in the list, the contents of that container can overflow and cause a scroll bar to appear. This was observed on Linux / Firefox v88\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFrequently used projects list displays a scroll bar\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe size of the container should expand (within reason) to support larger font sizes.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/4857bdfea7c46716f8984996b347ffcc/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T13:06:13.470Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T18:50:41.351Z","closed_at":"2022-09-27T18:50:41.323Z","closed_by":{"id":5212466,"username":"ericschurter","name":"Eric Schurter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5212466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ericschurter"},"labels":["Category:Navigation \u0026 Settings","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","missed:14.3","section::dev","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T11:37:08.063Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T10:17:05.475Z","closed_at":"2022-01-10T10:17:05.459Z","closed_by":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","devops::secure","feature flag","group::threat insights","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"}],"author":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334380","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":25},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"25 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334380","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334380/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334380/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334380","relative":"#334380","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334380"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89157321,"iid":334358,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add README file when creating new Security Policy Project","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.

Story\n\nAs product owner, I want to ensure that a trial license expires at the end of the trial period, so that I can prevent unauthorized access to an expired trial license.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAs noted in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334317#note_948703484), SM trial licenses already work the way this user story proposes. However, we don't enforce the presence of an expiration date for legacy licenses (trial or not) and the proposal is to take care of that. \n\n- [x] Update gitlab-license gem validation to require an expiration date - https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-license/-/merge_requests/16\n- [x] Tag/release new version of the gitlab-license gem \n- [x] Update the gem version in CDot - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5071\n- [x] Update the gem version in GL.com - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92479\n- [~] Update CustomersDot `expires_at` validation to apply to all licenses, not only cloud ones\n- [~] Update CustomersDot `expires_at` constraint to not allow null values\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- a trial license has a 30 day active period (TBC)\n- a trial license that is cancelled is deactivated at the end of the trial period\n\n## Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nI would be surprised if these tests are not already written for this, but in the case they aren't:\n\nTests should exist to ensure that the trial licenses, after expiration, are no longer able to perform specific functions.\n\n```ruby\n# pseudo\n\nsubject(:license) { create(:license, trial: true) }\n\nit 'expires' do\n  license.expire!\n  aggregate_failures do\n    expect(license).to be_expired\n    expect(current_group.plan).to

It's incomplete feature-wise, and will likely become increasingly stale as time goes on due to design churn of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5710 and https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3534. In fact, it's *already* stale based on the discussions in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267504 (e.g., see this thread: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267504#note_572527697).\n\n### Alert implementation commit\n\nThis adds the alert, as originally designed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12896, to the security MR widget.\n\nThe design is being rethought at the moment, perhaps in large part due to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5710, which is an effort to redesign all merge request widgets.\n\nThis alert implementation is almost certainly not going to be part of the eventual design (as far as I can tell), but the general structure of how to implement it is here (minus tests).\n\nNote that several unrelated GraphQL queries were modified (id fields were added to various entities) due to a manifestation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326101.\n\n### \"Show when target branch has security reports, but source branch doesn't\" implementation commit\n\nSpecifically, this makes the security MR widget show when the source branch is based on an old commit of the target branch, such that it isn't configured to run any security scans. Meanwhile, the target branch has advanced and *is* configured to run security scans. This gives an opportunity to prompt the user to rebase the source branch, in order to run security scans.\n\nIt should be noted that this is a rare edge case, and I'm not sure how worthwhile it is to actually handle it. A project is only likely to enable security scanning *once*, and once it has, any new branches created after it are unaffected. Only a few existing MRs, based on an old commit of the target branch, would show this, until they're rebased. To put this another way, the window when this is likely to happen for a given project is brief, and happens probably only once in a given project's lifetime.\n\nThis minimal implementation exposes the `security_reports_up_to_date?` field to the frontend, as per the second example in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/275818.\n\nUnfortunately, more work need to be done, as the MR widget renders in this case with a successful status, and message \"Security scanning detected no vulnerabilities\" which is not correct - security scanning did not even run!\n\nExactly *what* should be rendered instead varies from design to design, so it's not clear what to actually implement right now. As with the previous commit, this may become clearer with https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5710.\n\n### Job failure alert\n\nAs mentioned above, this was the original design, but is now stale (the intended design is TBD).\n\n![image](/uploads/1df4deb507af3b9dc19c276652fd315d/image.png)\n\n### Widget shown when target branch has security reports, but source branch doesn't\n\nAs described above, the implementation doesn't show the right message/status for this case, but the design is TBD.\n![image](/uploads/e562f1a620c466ad6074bc5108b4b24c/image.png)\n\nMR at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64608","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-22T16:54:27.228Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T17:24:21.327Z","closed_at":"2021-06-22T17:24:21.098Z","closed_by":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","auto updated","devops::secure","frontend","group::threat insights","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"}],"author":{"id":5412787,"username":"nmccorrison","name":"Neil McCorrison","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5412787/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmccorrison"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":553096,"username":"markrian","name":"Mark Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/553096/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markrian"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334307","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334307","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334307/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334307/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334307","relative":"#334307","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334307"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4427,"epic":{"id":114169,"iid":4427,"title":"Step 1: MR Security Widget refactor","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4427","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89109743,"iid":334304,"project_id":278964,"title":"DevOps Adoption -

But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-22T05:47:36.929Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T05:43:28.273Z","closed_at":"2021-10-05T05:43:19.458Z","closed_by":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","bug::performance","devops::manage","feature flag","group::authentication and authorization","missed:14.1","section::dev"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334234","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":22},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"22 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334234","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334234/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334234/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334234","relative":"#334234","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334234"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89064771,"iid":334233,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create ci database in CI","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64289, we have the ability to have a new `ci` database.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1.

See that Epic for a broader description of the feature.\n\nThere are currently some PG triggers that maintain the `projects.has_external_wiki` cache in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/49916.\n\nThe triggers contain `WHEN` clauses for when `type = 'ExternalWikiService'`, these will need to be changed to trigger when `type_new = 'Integrations::ExternalWiki'` instead. \n\nThe process for this would be to drop the old triggers and recreate new triggers. This will need to be done inside a transaction. As there will be _other_ triggers maintaining the `type_new` values (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333506) the caches should continue to work as before.\n\n(Note: A related trigger https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/51852 operates on the `category` column so does not need to be updated).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-21T04:51:51.857Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:39:27.036Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T14:15:44.034Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Stretch","backend","database","devops::manage","group::integrations","missed:14.2","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334127","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334127","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334127/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334127/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334127","relative":"#334127","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334127"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6177,"epic":{"id":288464,"iid":6177,"title":"Data migration: Change `integrations.type` values to reflect new namespaced models","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6177","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89001171,"iid":334121,"project_id":278964,"title":"External users are initially invited to create a project","description":"Context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64268#note_604516706\n\n![image](/uploads/f821268d7b0acde5ee3f79f717ebf281/image.png)\n\nWhen impersonating (or logging in as) an external user, I notice they are invited to create a project in the landing page.

See: https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin/issues/191#issuecomment-831972567\n\nSo perhaps this can be fixed with an dependency update.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. [ ] Update gradle init script `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/license-finder/-/blob/main/config/files/.gradle/init.gradle` to use new version of `license-gradle-plugin` (`v0.16.1`).\n1. [ ] Add integration test to `spec/integration/java/` to test analyzer behavior with gradle 7.\n1. [ ] Bump version of the analyzer and add changelog entry.\n1.

try to delete a branch with `%2F` in its name you will really delete the another branch with the almost name but with `/` instead of `%2F` being able to bypass protected branch user confirmation modal dialog\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a branch with a slash in its name, for example `test/feat1`  \n2. Protect the branch `test/feat1`  \n3. Create another branch with name `test%2Ffeat1`\n\n![1_branches_list.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8a7ec7a6-2d68-45be-8ebb-2635ba73b729/1_branches_list.png)\n\n4.

\"external\" (to that group) shared group, here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61366/diffs#3dcbcc79b02d356b3680761a34fa3cf7a8416ac4_187_187\n\nWe should also consider rendering a badge for when an external group is shared with a project, too, which means the `membership_type` will be `project_invite`, because those billable members also cannot be removed directly.\n\n# Proposal\n\nAdd an additional badge/condition, here:
