This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe CI variable `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE`, supported by all Dependency Scanning analyzers based on [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium), is not documented in [Dependency Scanning documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html), though it might be useful when configuring offline scanner.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nAs a user, I can easily understand how to use the CI variable to disable fetching the gemnasium DB at runtime.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCurrently, `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE` [is true by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.10.0/scanner/scanner.go#L38) and it causes Gemnasium-based analyzers to [update the local gemnasium-db clone using git](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.10.0/advisory/repo.go#L118).\n\nSince this feature can be useful for community contributors, our engineers, and since the equivalent `BUNDLER_AUDIT_UPDATE_DISABLED` env var is already documented in our user doc, it is the best place to add this one too.\n\n1. For consistency we must rename `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE` to `GEMNASIUM_UPDATE_DISABLED`, with a default value of `false` (in other words, by default, the `gemnasium` DB will be updated when a scan is run).\n\n   1. Rename `envVarDBUpdate` to `envVarDBUpdateDisabled` and `DB_UPDATE` to `DB_UPDATE_DISABLED` in [gemnasium/scanner/scanner.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/8e1557c/scanner/scanner.go#L27-27)\n   1. Update `Usage` in [gemnasium/scanner/scanner.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/8e1557c/scanner/scanner.go#L40-40) to reflect change in behaviour, using similar wording to [bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/blob/87254e2/analyze.go#L29-29):\n   \n      ```\n      Do not update the gemnasium-db git repo before scanning (default: false)\n      ```\n   1. Update the [gemnasium README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/8e1557c/README.md) to include a section on `Running the analyzer in airgapped or internal networks`, similar to the [description used in bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/blob/87254e2/README.md#L24-33)\n\n1. Update the [Dependency Scanning docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f6e06d4ddb7/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#L174-174)\n   1. Update the [Configuring specific analyzers used by dependency scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f6e06d4ddb7/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#L174-174) section to include details about the `GEMNASIUM_UPDATE_DISABLED` variable, using similar wording to the [`BUNDLER_AUDIT_UPDATE_DISABLED` variable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f6e06d4ddb7/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#L194-194)\n   1. Add a new section to document both approaches for users who want to use an alternate DB:\n      1. using a local copy of [the gemnasium-db repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) that can act as a remote for the container and be configured with `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL` to be fetched at runtime by the container.\n      1. using a local copy of [the gemnasium-db repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) that is not acting as a remote git repository but made available by any other means (`before_script` or included in the image) to the file system of the container (and possibly configured with `GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH`).\n\n      \u0026nbsp;\n\n      Note that while this is mainly useful for offline users, this is applicable to other usages, for example, when a user wants to use a custom DB. How we want to describe it in our documentation is to be determined.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n- [x] add `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE_DISABLED` to `gemnasium` (default: `false`)\n- [x] remove `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE`\n- [x] document this variable\n- [x] add a use case for using this variable in restricted network environments\n- [x] add corresponding case for `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL`\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### Available Tier\n\n* Ultimate/Gold\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE` is renamed to `GEMNASIUM_UPDATE_DISABLED`\n- `GEMNASIUM_UPDATE_DISABLED` is documented in our user documentation\n- users clearly understand the both possible approaches to configure a different Gemnasium DB.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution.¬†--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs @fzimmer stated in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213885#note_327896598:\n\n\u003e This is a more general point where in the SSF it may be desirable to default to on but to be able to disable replication on a case-by-case reason. If you don't need packages replicated for geo-replication, we should allow users to disable it.\n\nAs we continue to support more resources with the self-service framework, unnecessary replication will become more of a problem for users who only care about replication for particular resources.\n\n\n### Intended users\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\n* [ ] Allow admins to enable/disable replication per Replicator per secondary via the web UI.\n* [ ] Migrate feature flags to the new settings so anyone who has disabled anything by feature flag is not adversely impacted\n* [ ] Add any documentation and code needed to support developers adding new resources via the self-service framework\n* [ ] Until secondary mimicry is implemented, ensure there is a warning that secondary functionality may break due to missing files\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers have an easy way to disable and enable replication for specific resources. Engineers are easily able to add this functionality for new resources using the self-service framework.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nPremium and Ultimate\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-23T03:56:24.918Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T21:42:13.499Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T21:33:09.528Z","closed_by":{"id":4554077,"username":"nhxnguyen","name":"Nick Nguyen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554077/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nhxnguyen"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::systems","group::geo","section::enablement","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

These `alpine` images are missing an important `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file which Go-based binaries use to determine the order for hostname lookups.  This means that any Secure team tool that uses a Go-based binary and attempts to communicate with an external service hosted inside the same Docker container using the `localhost` alias for `127.0.0.1` may fail in some circumstances.\n\nI spent quite a bit time tracking down a [bug in Container Scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209009) which was ultimately caused by the lack of an `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file.  The purpose of this issue is to prevent these types of bugs from occurring in the future.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\nThe file `/etc/nsswitch.conf` is used by [Name Service Switch (NSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch) to determine where the system finds things like host names, passwords, and protocol numbers.\n\nHere‚Äôs a snippet from a sample `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file:\n\n```\nhosts: files dns\n```\n\nIn this example, host information first comes from `/etc/hosts` (files), then a DNS server (dns). See [The Non-complexity of /etc/nsswitch.conf](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/26/etc-nsswitch-conf-non-complexity/) for more details.\n\n`alpine` linux based images use the [musl implementation of the C standard library](https://musl.libc.org/) instead of the [GNU C Library (glibc)](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/). Unlike `glibc`, the `musl` implementation of `libc` doesn't support `NSS`, and therefore these `alpine` linux based images don't include an `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file.\n\nGo is hardcoded to behave as glibc (dns first and then use hosts if it fails) if there is no `/etc/nsswitch.conf`. This means that on `alpine` based images, if the `localhost` hostname is used as an alias for `127.0.0.1`, a Go-based binary will ignore this value and issue an external DNS lookup for `localhost`, which in some cases will return one of the Docker-assigned IP addresses and may cause the program to fail.\n\n**Note:** This behaviour was [changed in go 1.16](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/c80022204e8fc36ec487888d471de27a5ea47e17) so that entries in the `/etc/hosts` file will take precedence.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis issue can be fixed using either of the following approaches:\n\n- Update all of the `alpine` based Docker images used by the Secure team to include an `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file using the [pattern introduced in the Container Scanning tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/blob/40da77a7a53dfed87ae477709fd223b6cc8479ac/Dockerfile#L73):\n\n   ```docker\n   RUN [ ! -e /etc/nsswitch.conf ] \u0026\u0026 echo 'hosts: files dns' \u003e /etc/nsswitch.conf\n   ```\n\n- Update all of the `alpine` based Docker images used by the Secure team to use `Go \u003e= 1.16`.\n\nThe following analyzers

And, yes, i know about wildcard environments.\n\nReference: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209866\n\nWe should improve the documentation and UI.\n\n# Proposal\n\nSo for example, we can document like:\n\n---\n\n## Sequential Deployment (or Safe Continuous Deployment)\n\nIf your project follows Continuous Deployment practice that deploys `master` branch to `production` environment with GitLab CI/CD pipelines, you might encounter the following problems *due to the asynchronous nature of pipeline jobs**:\n\n- Multiple deployment jobs run concurrently to the same environment. It makes the environment unstable because deployment script conflicted and finished in immature state.\n- An old deployment job overwrites the latest deployment. It results in an unintentional rollback. Users experience old feature sets on the `production` website even though you see that the latest deployment job successfully finished.\n\nTo address these problems, GitLab provides the following options:\n\n- Limit the pipeline job concurrency.\n- Disallows deployments for old versions.\n\n### Limit the pipeline job concurrency\n\nYou can limit the pipeline job concurrency by specifying `resource_group` keyword into your .gitlab-ci.yml. With this option, your deployment jobs run once at a time therefore you can effectively avoid deployment job conflicts to the same environment. For example,\n\n1. Pipeline-A starts running with SHA-A.\n1. Pipeline-B starts running with SHA-B (newer).\n1. Pipeline-A starts a deployment.\n1. Pipeline-B waits for the Pipeline-A's deployment is done.\n\n(and more explanation ...)\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#resource_group\n\n### Disallows deployments for old versions.\n\nYou can disallows deployments for old versions by enabling **Skip outdated deployment jobs** checkbox. With this option, when an old deployment job is about to run, the job fails as \"The deployment job is older than the previously succeeded deployment job, and therefore cannot be run\". For example,\n\n1. Pipeline-A starts running with SHA-A.\n1. Pipeline-B starts running with SHA-B (newer).\n1. Pipeline-B finishes. Now SHA-B is on the production environment.\n1. Pipeline-A fails as it's going to deploy SHA-A to the production.\n\n(and more explanation ...)\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Having multiple deployment jobs in the same pipeline results in \"The deployment job is older than the previously succeeded deployment job...\" error\n\n...","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-23T03:11:06.044Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T13:08:50.723Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T01:59:07.227Z","closed_by":{"id":4155490,"username":"marcel.amirault","name":"Marcel Amirault","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155490/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marcel.amirault"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","Release::P2","cicd::active","devops::release","docs-only","group::release","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215469","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215469","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215469/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215469/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#215469","relative":"#215469","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#215469"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33660555,"iid":215466,"project_id":278964,"title":"Change location fingerprint for Container Scanning","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nFollowing the Design conclusion of [Allow Container Scanning to scan multiple container images for a single change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6946#conclusion) we need to update the way we store the location fingerprint for Container Scanning findings\n\n### Intended users\n\nInternal: ~\"devops::secure\" \u0026 ~\"devops::defend\" \n\n### Further details\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the fingerprint used by container scanning so that the same vulnerability found in multiple distinct Docker images will not be de-duplicated and will instead be included in the final report, tied to the particular image it was found in.

This is particularly useful for GitLab.com, where this type of traffic filtering is not possible. \n\nWe should move this into Premium/Silver:\n* It's a capability related to securing the deployment, not application security: For some, it's a must-have and creates a hard barrier-to-entry when getting started with GitLab. This is particularly true for GitLab.com. This limits our ability to land-and-expand with the account to help them grow a more mature practice that does use CI/CD and ultimately be able to take advantage of Gold level functionality.\n\n* Current state disadvantages our SaaS offering: Given the importance, this extends the difference between SaaS vs. self-managed. Native functionality for IP access restriction is not necessary for self-hosted customers, because you can handle that with *any* gitlab tier at the network/LB level. However, if a customer needs to use gitlab.com and cannot host themselves (e.g. company mandate to use SaaS, they don't have the internal team to support it, etc) it forces the GTM team to sell them Gold even if it doesn't fit their needs.\n\n* Our competitors offer this in Premium-like tiers: Atlassian offers this in [Premium](https://bitbucket.org/product/premium) for Bitbucket Cloud ($6/user/month). GitHub also offers this in [Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization)($21/user/month). Both could be compared to GitLab Premium.\n\nAs part of [GitLab's process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Move-A-Feature-Down.md), this has been [discussed internally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1057) (GitLab internal only link) and approved.\n\n## Proposal\n\n* Move group-level IP access restriction from Ultimate/Gold to Premium/Silver. Update associated specs and documentation.\n\n## Issue readiness\n\n* [x]  Product: issue description is accurate with an acceptable proposal for an MVC\n* [x]  Engineering: issue is implementable with few remaining questions, is sufficiently broken down, and is able to be estimated\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nSince this is a minor change, we would probably not need any automated test changes. However, we should manually test this to ensure that a Premium user is able to access the feature and that the Gold customer did not loose it.

Releases page metadata","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen sharing links in apps like Slack, Twitter, or Facebook, metadata from the link is often extracted and used to generate nice looking thumbnails/previews. For example, here's what a link to a GitLab issue looks like when shared in Slack:\n\n![image](/uploads/788ff35b6cdc3ef5c42df48b0bd02f68/image.png)\n\nNotice the preview contains info specific to the issue being shared (title, content, author, assignees).\n\nHowever, when sharing a Release-related link, the preview only contains the generic project information:\n\n![image](/uploads/e71b59da1eacf0b46ab402ba57fa9cc3/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd metadata to all Release pages so that when a link to a Release page is shared (i.e. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v12.10.0-ee), the preview shown in Slack or similar apps contains relevant info such as a few lines from the release notes, the release date, the release title, the release creator, any associated milestones, links, etc.\n\nWe should enable this for these two pages:\n\n- The main **Releases** page (i.e. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases)\n- Individual **Release** pages (i.e. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v12.10.0-ee)\n\n### Intended users\n\nAnyone who uses Releases, but mostly [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager).\n\n### Further details\n\nI think it probably makes the most sense to expose this metadata through [Open Graph (`og:`) tags](https://ogp.me/).\n\nA handy tool for testing a page's metadata is the Facebook Debugger. For example: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fgitlab-org%2Fgitlab%2F-%2Freleases%2Fv12.10.0-ee.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nWe should only expose information that is already publicly-accessible through the webpage.\n\n### Documentation\n\nNo documentation is required for this change.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-22T17:19:55.481Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T16:15:15.598Z","closed_at":"2020-10-01T16:15:15.540Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique Alc√°ntara","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3540517/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ealcantara"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Stuff that should Just Work","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::release","internal customer","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

[Scoping access token to particular projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15666) issue will resolve this problem at the access token level. However, the bot can still be manually added as a member to another project.\n\nThis issue is to prevent the bots from being shared across multiple projects.\n\nThe feature is currently behind the `resource_access_token` feature flag with default off.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a Project Access Token\n2. The Project Bot shows up in the member list\n3. Note the project bot username\n4. Go to another project, and add the bot as a member\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nProject Bots should not be shared across multiple projects. Same should be applicable for Group Bots too (whenever applicable).\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nPrevent project bot from being added as a member to any other projects (UI + API). The only way of adding project bots to a project will be via project access tokens.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-22T16:14:55.791Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T17:20:51.339Z","closed_at":"2020-07-20T08:06:37.227Z","closed_by":{"id":1315784,"username":"ifarkas","name":"Imre

Rendering multiple Vue apps can have a performance impact on a page and is unnecessary when the apps all concentrate around a single area. It can also make maintaining and updating the entire Audit Logs/Events view more difficult.\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo facilitate moving to the new soon-to-be API we should combine these into one Vue app which will handle the eventual store and interaction between each of these

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution.¬†--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\nThis issue stems from a community contribution https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24926, which is to provide the full range of authentication options provided by AWS. The solution would allow applications running in AWS ECS environment to obtain the credentials that are needed for service authentication. For more information about AWS ECS credential management strategy, please refer to this document, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24926.\n\nIn the discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24926, @spyoungtech and @kusuriya have tested passing required environment variables to indexer, which in turn can fetch the credentials via endpoint in the ECS agent container. This solution works in our users setup. When reviewing this solution, @nick.thomas [indicated there could one rate limiting related issue and suggested passing the credentials from sidekiq side](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24926#note_327198028),\n\n\u003e An issue we've seen in the past is that having lots of parallel `gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer` processes try to pull their own credentials or read from zeroconfig endpoints leads to hitting rate limits. So it's much better to do this kind of work in sidekiq and pass the results into `gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer` via the environment.\n\n@DylanGriffith also pointed out [another benefit of doing this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/24926#note_327731774),\n\n\u003e Additional benefit to moving to Ruby would be single source of truth since we need to do this in Ruby anyway.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe could try to fetch the credentials from sidekiq in case there are no statically configured credentials, then pass them when invoking gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe need to document what AWS environment we support.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nIt would be good if we can test it in the desired AWS environment, like EC2 and ECS.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

There would be a few ways to achieve this. 1 approach was explored in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29881 where we apply `.fullscreen-layout` class to the direct `div` child of `body`.

Default Project Selection When Creating New Issue from Epic Widget","description":"\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n_JTBD: When visualizing the plan of how my strategy will be implemented, I want to display how prioritized items cascade up toward larger vision and business objectives, so I can increase alignment on the overall impact and importance of even the most granular items within my plan._\n\nWhen trying to create a new issue within the epic tree, users:\n1. Are often already confused by the `Epic` \u003c\u003e Group , `Issue` \u003c\u003e Project relationships which impacts their experience in the epic tree as they expect to be able to create an issue [-within a group-]\n1. Are not always able to find their `Project` within the dropdown\n1. Often want to create many related issues in a row. This requires many clicks and multiple searches for the same project while creating multiple issues within the same project in the epic tree.\n\n\n### Validation and feedback\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cb\u003e:microscope: Prior details from Taylor\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe new create issue from Epic widget is awesome! However, I'd be even more awesome if it defaulted to the project that I was currently in, as I commonly want to create issues alongside an epic and associate them. I like the option to be able to choose another project, but the default could be set for my current project to speed things up and make this feel more magical. \n\nSteps to reproduce: \n- Go to an epic. \n- Create a new issue from the epic issue widget\n- Notice no default project is selected by default\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-04-21_at_2.36.56_PM](/uploads/6799a7c084f775faa18a8411bd25e193/Screen_Shot_2020-04-21_at_2.36.56_PM.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cb\u003e:microscope: Prior details from Libor\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAs a user creating a new issue within the context of an Epic, the expectation is that the new issue created will be linked to the epic in which it is created under. This works as expected. \n\nBut, when prompted to name the issue and assign it to a project, I have the same expectation, where I would expect the system to know the context in which I am working in and pre-populate the project field, allowing me to optionally change it if needed. \n\nMy assumption is that new issues created in the context of an epic will most commonly also be part of the same project that the epic is in.\n\n\nAlso, in terms of performance, searching for the current project in the dropdown takes ~12sec every time. \n\nPre-populating this field with a good default should increase the perception of system performance.\n\n | Current state |\n| ------ | \n| ![Project-should-be-pre-populated](/uploads/e4eb350b1ef527ac45fd3bc45af121bd/Project-should-be-pre-populated.gif) | cell |\n\n\n### Proposal \n- Pre-populate the \"Project\" dropdown with the same project that the epic is in.\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cb\u003e:microscope: Prior details from Nadia\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\nI often need to quickly add new issues to an epic as I'm creating actionable insight issues, and adding new issues to an epic is a bit difficult for me. :breathing-intensifies: [Here's a recording of the experience of adding new issues](https://share.getcloudapp.com/v1uLDLev) to an epic, with the pain points and ideas for improvement below.\n\n- The recently used projects aren't actually recently used. I've definitely used GitLab the most, but it's not there.\n- When I search for GitLab, I don't see the result because it's below the recently used projects. I thought the search was broken. The results are there, but I can't see them unless I scroll. I'd expect for the recently used projects section to disappear when I enter a search query so I can see only the results I filtered for. Also, for some reason GitLab isn't the first on the list even though it's a 100% match.\n- If I add a second issue, I have to go through the project search process all over again. Even after I've just selected GitLab, it doesn't show up in my recently used projects. It'd be nice if it was automatically preselected based on my latest results, or at least show up at the top of my recently used projects.\n- When I add an issue, the whole section reloads and is quite slow. I'd love for the issue to just be added to the list. Perhaps the principle of optimistic UI could be applied here and we could show the added issue to the table as it loads in the background to increase the perceived performance. If there's a problem and the issue can't be saved for some reason, then we can deal with that, but most of the time the issue will be created, and we can provide instant feedback to the user.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe can start iterating on issue 3 mentioned above by implementing something similar to [our epic experience](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326183) for issues.\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Default the `Project` dropdown with the _user's_ last used project\n- **Scenario 2**: If the user has never created an issue before, there would be no default.\n\n| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/8c91ba9d8c1968cf96d8ed175c18145a/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/e5a8b070e6cc18d273ed0b954fb814a1/image.png) |","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-21T19:41:45.859Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:33:44.102Z","closed_at":"2022-09-14T21:13:56.895Z","closed_by":{"id":3509693,"username":"nicolasdular","name":"Nicolas Dular","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c4a21f15150c12ddf13fd848597cddd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolasdular"},"labels":["Next Up","SUS::Impacting","Stretch","UX","UX debt","backend","design-weight::1","devops::plan","epic tree","epics","feature flag","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::product planning","section::dev","severity::2","type::feature","usability","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":3509693,"username":"nicolasdular","name":"Nicolas Dular","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c4a21f15150c12ddf13fd848597cddd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolasdular"},{"id":3617348,"username":"uhlexsis","name":"Alexis Ginsberg","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3617348/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/uhlexsis"}],"author":{"id":5329074,"username":"tmccaslin","name":"Taylor McCaslin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5329074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tmccaslin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3509693,"username":"nicolasdular","name":"Nicolas Dular","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c4a21f15150c12ddf13fd848597cddd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nicolasdular"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215206","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215206","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215206/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215206/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#215206","relative":"#215206","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#215206"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33589573,"iid":215203,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add way to specify a custom certificate chain in the gemnasium-maven analyzer","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUsers of java projects with custom repositories and custom ca chains currently need to use a workaround in getting Dependency Scanning to work.\n\nInstead of being able to add their certificate to the analyzer via the `CI \u003e Variables`, users must instead modify the analyzer image with a `keytool` import command (see [offline maven documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#java-maven-projects) for an example).\n\nThe current state of using this analyzer with custom certificates is cumbersome and requires the editing of the ci template.

Projects with the largest repositories.\n  * (This is the most important selection aspect. The rest of these would be very nice to have, but would be more difficult to implement, and would probably require additional database tables, caching, and asynchronous workers doing some metadata analysis or querying.)\n1.

This means that I may wish to \"migrate\" the project repository to another chard, or really, clone it and delete the original.\n- I would very much like to determine which projects have no activity, so that I archive them, put them in cold-storage, or otherwise cull them from the shard fs to make room for other projectories.\n- It would also be nice to simply have access to a list of the most popular or active projects in the inventory of my installation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAs an admin, I've already tried to go about solving this problem using a custom script which executes within the context of a gitlab runner.  This is a brittle, non-sustainable approach, however, since there is no contract for the internal Rails ActiveRecord model classes.\n\nSo instead, I'd prefer to be able to invoke an HTTP API method which responds with a json format list of project details (_especially_ including the statistics.repository_size` field which is currently not included in the existing `GET /projects/` api) according to an order and set of conditions that are either provided using some parameter arguments, or else are pre-built into specific api route resources/actions, such as:\n\n- `GET /projects/largest[?limit=N]`\n- `GET /projects/most_commits[?since=date\u0026limit=N]`\n- `GET /projects/busiest[?since=date\u0026limit=N]`\n- `GET /projects/dormant[?since=date\u0026limit=N]`\n\nWhere `date` defaults to say, a month.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nThe permission level here should be admin, and a `Private-Token` header should be required, the value of which should be a token set with the lowest level appropriate for read-only access to metadata information for all projectories in the GitLab managed inventory.\n\n### Documentation\n\nAre the `~devops::create` and `~group::source code` labels sufficient here?\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n* What risks does this change pose to our availability?\n  - There should be no risks to availability.  If gathering such information is processing intensive in terms of long-running queries and so forth, then perhaps a cache/datastore with some asynchronous job workers would be recommended.\n* How might it affect the quality of the product?\n  - If some of the queries for metadata/aggregation/calculation are long-running, then this could potentially create some resource contention for serving other requests.\n* What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?\n  - Unit tests for the backend controller and service/worker implementations.\n  - Functional API tests to confirm output is expected compared to database/disk information.\n* Will it require cross-browser testing?\n  - No.\n\nTest areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that need to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended:\n* Unit test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nSuccess looks like a speedy, sustainable, contracted, API method which provides the desired metadata information about the projects which are stored and managed by a GitLab installation.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nNot sure.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nI don't think so.\n\n### Links /

Have a gitlab-ee test instance with admin access\n1. Create a project, and a Personal Access Token (PAT) for the API\n1. Create a release: `curl -H 'PRIVATE-TOKEN: $token' \"https://$instance/api/v4/projects/1/releases\" -i --data \"tag_name=1.0\u0026ref=master\"`\n1. Browse the admin page at `/admin/audit_logs` and notice the 500.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe audit event can't be parsed and a 500 error is thrown in the admin page.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe audit event should be correctly displayed.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```\n{\"method\":\"GET\",\"path\":\"/admin/audit_logs\",\"format\":\"html\",\"controller\":\"Admin::AuditLogsController\",\"action\":\"index\",\"status\":500,\"duration\":79.26,\"view\":0.0,\"db\":7.84,\"time\":\"2020-04-21T13:46:30.705Z\",\"params\":[],\"remote_ip\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"user_id\":1,\"username\":\"root\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36\",\"queue_duration\":3.1,\"redis_calls\":7,\"redis_duration_ms\":1.48,\"correlation_id\":\"1QEPoeXkfE9\",\"cpu_s\":0.08218736000003446,\"exception.class\":\"ActionView::Template::Error\",\"exception.message\":\"undefined method `strip' for :custom:Symbol\",\"exception.backtrace\":[\"ee/app/views/admin/audit_logs/index.html.haml:75\",\"ee/app/views/admin/audit_logs/index.html.haml:63:in `each'\",\"ee/app/views/admin/audit_logs/index.html.haml:63\",\"app/controllers/application_controller.rb:125:in `render'\",\"ee/lib/gitlab/ip_address_state.rb:10:in `with'\",\"ee/app/controllers/ee/application_controller.rb:43:in `set_current_ip_address'\",\"app/controllers/application_controller.rb:479:in `set_current_admin'\",\"lib/gitlab/session.rb:11:in `with_session'\",\"app/controllers/application_controller.rb:470:in `set_session_storage'\",\"app/controllers/application_controller.rb:464:in `set_locale'\",\"lib/gitlab/error_tracking.rb:34:in `with_context'\",\"app/controllers/application_controller.rb:555:in `sentry_context'\",\"lib/gitlab/application_context.rb:48:in `block in use'\",\"lib/gitlab/application_context.rb:48:in `use'\",\"lib/gitlab/application_context.rb:20:in `with_context'\",\"app/controllers/application_controller.rb:455:in `set_current_context'\",\"ee/lib/gitlab/jira/middleware.rb:19:in `call'\"]}\n```\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThis happens because `Audit::Details#humanize` will try to use the [first key in the `details` object](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/dc2b1c648e91b6d582de41f632fec110388b1a0f/ee/lib/audit/details.rb#L105-107) - however for custom messages related to the release API, it will be a symbol instead of a string (`:action:` instead of `:custom_message`) since the object looks like:\n\n```\n{\n  :action=\u003e:custom,\n  :custom_message=\u003e\"Created Release 1.0\",\n  :ip_address=\u003e\"127.0.0.1\",\n  :target_id=\u003e1,\n  :target_type=\u003e\"Release\",\n  :target_details=\u003e\"1.0\",\n  :entity_path=\u003e\"root/test-project\"\n}\n```\n\nMaybe we should change that method to look for `details[:custom_message]` instead of `details.each_value.first`? Not sure how that affects other types of events though.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-21T16:33:11.580Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T18:29:32.411Z","closed_at":"2020-05-04T23:04:05.031Z","closed_by":{"id":4375373,"username":"cat","name":"Catalin

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution.¬†--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try¬†to¬†define¬†the¬†who/what/why¬†of¬†the¬†opportunity¬†as¬†a¬†user¬†story.¬†For¬†example,¬†\"As¬†a¬†(who),¬†I¬†want¬†(what),¬†so¬†I¬†can¬†(why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nWe frequently run into Gitaly timeouts when rendering wiki pages (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199667).\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) --\u003e\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nLong-term fixes are being discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199667, this mostly involves reducing or eliminating Gitaly calls.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAs a short-term fix, we could catch these errors in Rails and render an error message instead, with a link to reload the page.\n\nThis should happen for all read-only Gitaly calls in the `Projects::WikisController` actions.\n\nThe error message should read:\n\n\u003e The page could not be displayed because it timed out. You can [view the source]() or [clone the repository locally]() instead.\n\n- `view the source` links to the raw page (same URL, but with the extension appended)\n- `clone the repository locally` links to the `/git_access` page\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n \n\n@toupeira:\n* Simulate timeouts\n* Verify the error message.\n\n@.luke:\n* Controller Test\n* Feature Test\n\n@lulalala:\n* Display of error page with refresh link\n \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nWe want to see a reduction in `Deadline Exceeded` GRPC errors when rendering wiki pages.\n\nIn Kibana I think these show up as either `Canceled` or `Unknown`.\n\nKibana dashboard: [Wiki RPC errors over time](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/kibana#/visualize/edit/c093a310-83e2-11ea-8617-2347010d3aab?_g=(filters%3A!()%2CrefreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!t%2Cvalue%3A0)%2Ctime%3A(from%3Anow-24h%2Cto%3Anow)))\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-21T15:23:58.822Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T07:07:10.526Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T17:15:50.099Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["Category:Wiki","Deliverable","backend","backend-weight::2","bug::performance","devops::create","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:13.6","quad-planning::complete-no-action","sec-planning::no-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":423116,"username":"toupeira","name":"Markus Koller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7585ed50675c4febe7619f25b44f7fe0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/toupeira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215165","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215165","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215165/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215165/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#215165","relative":"#215165","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#215165"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33577847,"iid":215164,"project_id":278964,"title":"Show correct import label and import count on Jira import form","description":"Currently, the import label for the Jira import form shows a hardcoded value of `jira-import::KEY-1`.

This would be useful for GitLab's own use of SSO in `gitlab-org` and `gitlab-com`. This idea came about from dogfooding discussions with @lmcandrew for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/-/issues/16431. \n\nCurrently, the `SSO Enforcement` requires *all* users to use SSO to access a group and its projects. This precludes GitLab from using the feature with the `gitlab-org` and `gitlab-com` groups because we have open-source projects. \n\n### Proposal\n\nI believe we can accomplish this by checking whether a user has a matching SAML identity upon accessing the group or its projects. If there's a matching identity, make sure the user has an active SSO session or send them to the IdP to authenticate. We wouldn't want to do this check on every request so there should probably be some cache, too. The flow might look like:\n\n1. User accesses a group or project where SSO is enabled.\n2. GitLab checks if the user is an actual member (as opposed to outside user accessing a public or internal project). \n3. If a member, check if the user has a matching SAML identity. \n4. If a matching identity, send through the SSO process. \n    - As an adaptation here we could skip checking for a matching identity and send all members through the SSO process.\n4. User is able to access the group and its projects as normal. \n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

This includes mails from the Email on Push feature. We unchecked \"Send from committer\".

Enable Emails on Push for a repository\n  - uncheck \"Send from committer\"\n  - enter multiple recipients, seperated by space or newline\n3. Push to the repository\n\n### Example Project\n\nThis happens on our self-hosted GitLab instance.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOnly the first recipient will receive the mail correctly signed.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution.¬†--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try¬†to¬†define¬†the¬†who/what/why¬†of¬†the¬†opportunity¬†as¬†a¬†user¬†story.¬†For¬†example,¬†\"As¬†a¬†(who),¬†I¬†want¬†(what),¬†so¬†I¬†can¬†(why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nCompliance-minded organizations require their GitLab instances and groups be auditable. This means they need access to evidence artifacts, or reports, about a particular resource. One of the most common asks for an audit is viewing a list of users and their access so it can be compared against the organization's internal company policy for access management.\n\nCurrently, customers cannot easily obtain membership data for their users without building custom API scripts and investing the time and effort into that tooling. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* The stakeholders managing a compliance program for GitLab -\u003e [Compliance Persona UX Research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/546)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nAn issue [already exists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1772) to implement an export for this; however, in the spirit of iteration, we believe it makes sense to first show a high-level sum of groups and projects for each user.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nAdd a sum of `Groups` and `Projects` to the `Users` view in the `Admin Area`.\n\n![Users_list_with_group_and_project_count](/uploads/b331c94862ff5250976551129658a686/Users_list_with_group_and_project_count.png)\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Implementation issue for project count https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249590 `2`\n- Implementation issue for group count https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/249589 `3`\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\nOnly `administrators` can view this data.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

Group Test Coverage now includes a graph of the average of all project test coverage over time to provide at a glance how test coverage for the group is trending over time.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a development team lead, I want a single image to show the current code coverage and how it's trending over time, so I can quickly get the test coverage data that [Dakota](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#dakota---the-application-development-director) is asking for and get back to work.\n\n**From the epic:** As a development team lead, I want a single page of code coverage data for my group's projects, so I can quickly get the test coverage data [Dakota](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#dakota---the-application-development-director) is asking for and get back to work.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve?

This is that graph.\n* This saves Delaney the step of creating the graph themselves after downloading the data.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n* By default include all projects that belong to a group and have jobs with coverage data calculated.\n    * This does not include sub-groups at this time. We'll cover this in a [future iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/273527).\n* By default include just the value(s) from the default branch for each project\n* We know that \"average\" of these is not a great number but by providing [links into projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215135) and [other data within the projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21550) Delaney and their team can make informed decisions. This is intended to provide a starting point for conversation.\n    * Average in this case will be (sum of job coverage values / number of jobs with coverage value)\n* Add the data to the GraphQL API for historic coverage data to build the graph of the average coverage over time @morefice can you help fill in the technical bits and schema with @mfluharty\n\n#### Frontend\n\nAdd a new section/component (`TestCoverageGraph`?) to [`group_repository_analytics.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/analytics/repository_analytics/components/group_repository_analytics.vue#L4) to handle the following:\n\n* Load recent coverage data (`codeCoverageActivities`) via ~GraphQL, see example query below\n* Display the data as a line graph using [GlAreaChart](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/charts-area-chart--default) with coverage value as the vertical axis and time as the horizontal axis - we can steal some inspiration from the `Code coverage statistics for master` section of the existing [Project Repository Analytics page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/graphs/master/charts) ([source code link](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/pages/projects/graphs/components/code_coverage.vue))\n\n\n```\n{\n  group(fullPath: \"gitlab-org\") {\n    name\n    id\n    codeCoverageActivities(startDate: \"2020-10-20\") {\n      nodes {\n        projectCount\n        averageCoverage\n        coverageCount\n        date\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNone.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Add a screenshot and a blurb to the [existing documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#repositories-analytics)\n* Add any caveats, exceptions, etc. to the documentation\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

ndjson","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently, the Project import/export very vaguely describes the compatibility matrix: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html.\n\nIt seems to define almost inifinite forward/backward compatibility of `import/export`,\nwhich is not true compared to practice on how we test it and how we use it.\n\nWe merged ndjson support for project import/export that vastly improves the process,\nmaking it memory constant and allow to much easier import/export very big projects.\nWith the %13.0 we have great opportunity to use `ndjson` by default and better define\nthe compatibility to reflect our practices.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose to better define compatibility of Project Import/Export and define a removal of support for old format:\n\n* we allow to import exported project only in GitLab newer or equal (export from %13.0 can be imported into %13.0, %13.1, and so on): as this is something that we test today as part of our testing suite\n* we do not allow to import exported project if it was created be newer version (export from %13.4 cannot be imported into %13.0): we cannot test that, as we do not actively develop the older version of GitLab to adapt and support newer structure of data\n* we define to drop the support for old format (non-ndjson) one in one of the future release, it could be %\"13.4\" \n* our practice working with project import/export says that our Support team always when working with import/export functionality requests to use matching versions of GitLab to avoid problems with data migrations, schema mismatches, renames and new structures\n\n### Results\n\nIf we would better define that we could effectively close the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35861 and https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2734.\n\n### Other links/references\n\n*

ndjson support","description":"### TL;DR\n\nWith the %13.0 and group import/export using ndjson almost finished.\nWe have great opportunity to drop old format and switchover to ndjson one.\n\nThis allows us to mark this feature as stable (from experimental) and consider\nthe major performance issues to be solved https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/199037#note_279647849.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe `group import/export` is a new feature (2-3 milestones old), and when it was shipped it was mark as subject to change. When doing that we already did know that this is unperformant and we gonna have to fix it sooner (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/199037#note_279647849).\n\nThe Project import/export already today is not defining forward and backward compatibility, where the forward compatibility is pretty much broken, as we continue adding new models.\n\nThe Group on the other hand has the same design problems: it does not define forward/backward compatibility, so, it I would assume that this not functional if you don't use matching version of GitLab. We build a safeguard into Group Import/Export to say [Introduced in GitLab 12.8 as an experimental feature. May change in future releases.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/group_import_export.html) to allow us to change the format, as we knew at a time of introduction that this is suboptimal.\n\nGiven the:\n\n* limited users (I'm aware at this moment of only our GitHost customer)\n* feature marked as experimental\n* format of data being inefficient\n* making it troublesome to support old format\n* %13.0 being a new major milestone\n\nI would say that:\n\n* it seems fully reasonable to use a new and efficient data format (ndjson)\n* mark this as a final format\n* do not provide backward compatibility for something that was experimental\n* with introduction of ndjson mark this as stable\n\n### Proposal / Documentation\n\nWe do miss a proper documentation for Group Import/Export that would define compatibility,\nkind of similar to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html.\n\nI believe we should create a user-guide for Group Import/Export documenting clearly what can be imported where.\n\nI would assume based on past experience working Project Import/Export that we should be careful how wide we define this compatibility. I think we should create for %13.0 similar document to this one, with the following expectations:\n\n* we allow to import exported groups only in GitLab newer or equal (export from %13.0 can be imported into %13.0, %13.1, and so on): this is something that we test today as part of our testing suite\n* we do not allow to import exported groups if it was created be newer version (export from %13.4 cannot be imported into %13.0): we cannot test that, as we do not actively develop the older version of GitLab to adapt and support newer structure of data\n\nThe practice says that our Support team always when working with import/export functionality requests to use matching versions of GitLab to avoid problems with data migrations, schema mismatches, renames and new structures.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Further specifics for how can we solve the problem. --\u003e\n\n### Who can address the issue\n\n\u003c!-- What if any special expertise is required to resolve this issue? --\u003e\n\n### Other links/references\n\n- https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2734\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29590","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-21T09:51:13.045Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T20:57:33.289Z","closed_at":"2020-05-13T09:54:07.207Z","closed_by":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Deliverable","Importer:Project Export/Import","Unscheduled","devops::manage","documentation","estimation::needed","group::import","milestone::p2","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},{"id":926632,"username":"joshlambert","name":"Joshua Lambert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0bdc5209b11e9c0953f80234dcb4ffb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/joshlambert"},{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delaliƒá","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"}],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzci≈Ñski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":696751,"username":"kassio","name":"Kassio Borges","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be7919dfa5d1e8b8826bf51bfc747055?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kassio"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215124","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215124","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215124/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215124/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#215124","relative":"#215124","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#215124"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2734,"epic":{"id":24334,"iid":2734,"title":"Introduce `.ndjson` as a way to process import","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2734","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33555592,"iid":215110,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST vulnerabilities show more information about the request -

This controller will live at `ee/app/controllers/groups/analytics/repositories_analytics_controller.rb` and have a `show` route that renders the HAML `show` file that we created.\n\nWe'll need to add a route to this page in the `ee/config/routes/group.rb` file. This can be done by adding the line `resource :repositories_analytics, only: [:show]` under the analytics section.\n\nWe also need to add the link to the group navbar under the analytics dropdown. We should be able to do this by adding the link to the `ee/app/helpers/ee/analytics/navbar_helper.rb` and `ee/app/helpers/ee/groups_helper.rb` files.\n\nTo download the CSV, we'll use the endpoint created in [this backend MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/27094) - specifically the index endpoint in the `app/controllers/projects/ci/daily_build_group_report_results_controller.rb` file.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nAny user should be able to get to this page / download the data.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Create documentation for this feature.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nTesting needed:\n* Appropriate level of unit/integration tests for new functionality\n* Created new E2E test requirement for this feature\n  * https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/testcases/-/issues/932\n* package-and-qa not required for this feature unless E2E test is ready first (possible)\n\nRisks:\n* Known risk of providing \"average\" coverage to possibly be misleading\n  * Should be mitigated with appropriate docs and by allowing users to download all data\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* See the [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3108).\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n[Dakota - The Application Development Director](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#dakota---the-application-development-director) is the buyer for this feature.\n\nThis will be built for ~\"GitLab Premium\"\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nThis iteration will not be cross-stage\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-21T02:55:16.944Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T13:47:59.429Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T13:23:17.411Z","closed_by":{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","UX","Verify::P1","backend","devops::verify","direction","documentation","frontend","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:13.3","quad-planning::complete-action","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233753,"iid":51,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.662Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:33.769Z","due_date":"2020-09-17","start_date":"2020-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/51"},"assignees":[{"id":1125848,"username":"samdbeckham","name":"Sam Beckham","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1125848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/samdbeckham"},{"id":3374280,"username":"mfluharty","name":"Miranda Fluharty","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3374280/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfluharty"},{"id":4554255,"username":"jj-ramirez","name":"Juan J.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?

For section entries, we display the name of the section above the approval rule, in a smaller, muted text style (if it helps, I used the classes `small` and `text-muted` in the image below).\n\n![image](/uploads/32345f62e62fda86e8412522de7fa1e8/image.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-20T15:04:00.491Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:44:26.855Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T05:46:35.465Z","closed_by":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","approvals","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","missed-deliverable","missed:13.1","quad-planning::complete-no-action","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233746,"iid":49,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:28:01.032Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:48:24.167Z","due_date":"2020-07-17","start_date":"2020-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/49"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"}],"author":{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215050","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215050","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215050/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/215050/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#215050","relative":"#215050","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#215050"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3593,"epic":{"id":68775,"iid":3593,"title":"Sectional CODEOWNERS","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3593","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":33521127,"iid":215045,"project_id":278964,"title":"LE integration for pages doesn't work for mixed-cased domains.","description":"Noticed on my own domain: SHUSHLIN.DEV\n\nIf domains is saved in mixed case, LE validation doesn't work because we search domain case-sensetively: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6657e62527b241f7cc511f9388bedc8f22aa1930/app/models/pages_domain_acme_order.rb#L22\n\n### Workaround\n\nSave domain in lowercase","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-20T14:50:45.229Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T03:03:46.228Z","closed_at":"2022-05-09T03:03:46.215Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"ü§ñ GitLab Bot ü§ñ","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Category:Pages","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","[deprecated] low hanging fruit","auto closed","backend","cicd::planning","devops::create","group::editor","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

However, this is not applied when user permission changes from maintainer to guest. \n\nAs a result, if user was previously a maintainer in the project he/she can add the project to their security dashboard and when their access levels decreases to guest, they can still view new security vulnerabilities result found in the project through their security dashboard. New security issues found in the project are reflecting back to the guest user security dashboard.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n*  User A create a private project and add user B with maintainer access  \n* User B will add the project in his security dashboard.  \n* User A reduced the user B access level to guest. Now, user B can't view any old and new security issues in the project directly  \n* User B access the project new as well as old security issues through his security dashboard and also the specific new files where the issues lies  \n* Done\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is actually very high.

One setting is `File sync capacity`, with a suggested value of `10`. Administrators are able to set this as they wish but very large values can cause issues. We should limit this to a more sane maximum.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212852\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n* Unit tests\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nAdministrators are warned when they enter a larger number and the form doesn't allow saving above this maximum\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What¬†is¬†the¬†buyer¬†persona¬†for¬†this¬†feature?¬†See¬†https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go?
