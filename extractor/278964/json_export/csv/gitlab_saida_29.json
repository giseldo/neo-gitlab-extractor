It should be fine to commit the secrets in our code, since these apps are only available in the Ecosystem workspace.\n\nOnce the Classic app flow is working, we can start updating one of the app copies to GBP:\n\n1. Make sure both copies are \"installed\" in the Ecosystem workspace.\n   - Change `application_settings` accordingly.\n1. Update the second copy to GBP:\n   - Initiate the update using the `Update to Granular Scopes` link in the sidebar.\n   - Check the migration guides, I think initially we only need the `commands` scope.\n   - Take notes about other changes that are needed (if any).\n   - Take notes how this looks from the user perspective in the Ecosystem workspace.\n     - Does the app need to be \"reinstalled\" in the workspace?\n     -

The challenge here is that we'd need to change the global `application_settings` for the Slack app, or ship some code to switch between different apps.\n    - Changing `application_settings` could be acceptable, we'd probably have to discuss this in a Change Management issue.\n  - The benefit is that the URLs are permanent, and all team members can easily access this instance.\n- Gitpod\n  - The challenge here is that the instance and URLs are not permanent, but maybe there is a way to setup a fixed URL / shared workspace.\n  - The benefit is that we can make arbitrary code changes and don't have to wait for deployments.\n\nMaybe for this issue we can just start with staging URLs, and then figure this out as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355994. We can always change the URLs later as needed.\n\nIt should also be possible to communicate with multiple instances from the same app:\n\n- For OAuth, we can add multiple allowed redirect URLs.\n- For the slash command, we can define multiple ones for different instances, with their own request URLs (e.g. `/staging`, `/gitpod`).\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Make sure you have access to:\n   - GitLab Ecosystem workspace: https://app.slack.com/client/T0187G888CD\n   - Administration for the Slack app: https://api.slack.com/apps/A676ADMV5\n1. Create a first copy of the production app:\n   - We'll keep this one as Classic for testing, so let's call it `GitLab Testing (Classic)`.\n   - Use the URL https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1 to create the app.\n   - Manually copy all the settings from the production app. The important ones are in `Slash commands` and `OAuth \u0026 Permissions`.\n   - Change the URLs (OAuth redirect URL, and slash command request URL) to staging.gitlab.com.\n   - Note down the app ID / administration URL in this issue. We'll also need the client ID and various secrets later, but we can always get those from the app administration.\n1. Create a second copy of the production app:\n   - We'll upgrade this one from Classic to GBP, so let's call it `GitLab Testing (GBP)`.\n   - Repeat the process for the first app, again using the URL

of group `alpha`, they can not use the modal to invite `alpha` to a different group `cats`. \n  - If the **Administrator** is a member of group `beta`, they **can** use the modal to invite the `beta` group to the group `cats`. \n\nThis `invite_members_group_modal` was recently fully rolled out and the feature flag cleaned up. For context, please see: \n*   [[Feature flag] Cleanup invite_members_group_modal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81940)\n*   [Cleanup invite_members_group_modal - remove controller paths](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82411)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n  1. As a regular (non-Administrator) user, create a group `codingcats`. We will invite other groups to this group. \n  1. As a regular (non-Administrator) user, create a group called `alpha`\n  1. As a regular (non-Administrator) user, create a group called `bravo`. Add the **Administrator** to the `bravo` group as **Developer**.\n  1. Log in as **Administrator**\n  1. Browse to the `codingcats` group \u003e **Group information** \u003e **Members**\n  1. Click **Invite a group**\n  1. Click the **Select a group to invite** drop-down\n  1. Observe that the `bravo` group is shown but the `alpha` group is not shown\n  1. Search for `alpha`\n  1. Observe that the `alpha` group is not found\n\n\nIf you add the **Administrator** to the `alpha` group and repeat steps **407**, the Administrator can see and invite the `alpha` group. \n  \n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.

[ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-15T09:17:58.948Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T06:09:46.031Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T06:09:45.987Z","closed_by":{"id":6354882,"username":"alberts-gitlab","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6354882/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Build Artifacts","Deliverable","Verify::P1","automation:ml","devops::verify","feature flag","feature::addition","group::pipeline insights","missed-deliverable","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","priority::1","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1212252,"iid":48,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 1-3 releases","description":"Issues which are not quite ready to schedule, but should be considered as part of the near-term roadmap.","state":"active","created_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48"},"assignees":[{"id":6354882,"username":"alberts-gitlab","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6354882/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":6354882,"username":"alberts-gitlab","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6354882/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":6354882,"username":"alberts-gitlab","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6354882/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355833","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":12,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 12 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355833","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355833/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355833/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#355833","relative":"#355833","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#355833"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"},{"id":104833288,"iid":355831,"project_id":278964,"title":"The group activity UI fails to load with 500 error","description":"\nhttps://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/3189515/?referrer=gitlab_plugin\n\n```\nPG::QueryCanceled: ERROR:  canceling statement due to statement timeout\n\n  lib/gitlab/database/load_balancing/connection_proxy.rb:110:in `block in read_using_load_balancer'\n    connection.send(...)\n  lib/gitlab/database/load_balancing/load_balancer.rb:55:in `read'\n    return yield connection\n  lib/gitlab/database/load_balancing/connection_proxy.rb:109:in `read_using_load_balancer'\n    @load_balancer.read do |connection|\n  lib/gitlab/database/load_balancing/connection_proxy.rb:54:in `select_all'\n    read_using_load_balancer(:select_all, arel, name, binds)\n  app/models/event_collection.rb:37:in `to_a'\n    relation.with_associations.to_a\n...\n(195 additional frame(s) were not displayed)\n\nActiveRecord::QueryCanceled: PG::QueryCanceled: ERROR:  canceling statement due to statement timeout\n```\n\n---\n\nCustomer is receiving 500 error when loading the activity page of their top level group.

Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nExternal users/users without privilege/guests (depends on project visibility) can access CI variables of a Gitlab project using GraphQL. The table below explains all situations that a user can access CI variables:\n\n| Project visibility | Public Project | Internal Project | Private Project |  \n| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |  \n| External user | Yes | No | No |  \n| User | Yes | Yes | No |  \n| Guest | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a project, then create a masked CI variable in the project name `PASSWORD`, disable **Protect variable** and enable **Mask variable**  \n2. From another account (no role in the project), run the following query in the GraphQL Explorer\n\n```graphql\n{\n  ciConfig(\n    projectPath: \"dcouture/public_project\"\n    content: \"include: https://[redacted]/$VARIABLE_NAME.yaml\"\n  ) {\n    errors\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3.

\"Shared Runner Usage\" page for project groups appears to be reporting seconds rather than minutes","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353062 recently made a new graph of shared runner usage available to free users. \n\nUnder a project group, the `Settings -\u003e Usage Quotas -\u003e Shared Runner Usage` page has the graphs that claim to be reporting usage in **minutes**.\n\nWhen I look at my projects, the quote usage appears incredibly high compared to my rough calculations of typical pipeline duration multiplied by number of pipelines per month. \n\nTo attempt to check my own expectations I wrote a crude program (https://gitlab.com/berrange/gitlab-pipelines) to query the GitLab API and calculate duration across pipelines. The figures I get from my program are in the ballpark of x60 smaller than reported in the graph and more in line with what I hoped would be the usage.  \n\nFor example, with the 'libosinfo' project, GitLab graphs claim an average of around 300,000 minutes / month, or 5,000 hours\n\nWhen I run my own calculation of usage for the last month (Feb 14-Mar 14) with the program linked above I get\n\n```\n$ go build\n$ ./pipelines gitlab.token  libosinfo\n.................................\n\nProject libosinfo\n   Duration: 56h55m59s\n   Pipelines: 34 (avg duration 1h40m28.205882352s)\n   Jobs: 1006 (avg duration 3m23.736580516s)\nProject osinfo-db\n   Duration: 18h3m22s\n   Pipelines: 8 (avg duration 2h15m25.25s)\n   Jobs: 202 (avg duration 5m21.792079207s)\nProject osinfo-db-tools\n   Duration: 19h17m38s\n   Pipelines: 32 (avg duration 36m10.5625s)\n   Jobs: 946 (avg duration 1m13.42283298s)\n\nGroup libosinfo\n Duration: 94h16m59s\n Pipelines: 74 (avg duration 1h16m26.743243243s)\n Jobs: 2154 (avg duration 2m37.576137418s)\n\n```\n\nThis is x53 lower than what GitLab graphs claim.\n\nThus I'm suspecting the graph is mistakenly reporting **seconds** rather than **minutes**\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Go to a project group that uses shared runners for all of its CI\n* Open the page `Settings -\u003e Usage Quotas -\u003e Shared Runner Usage`\n* Observe the number of minutes reported in the graph\n* Compare this to the sum of minutes for all jobs in all pipelines in all repositories under the project group in an equivalent 1 month period\n\n### Example Project\n\nLook at any project which is using shared runners\n\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe number of `Shared Runner Usage` minutes appears to be over-reported by a factor of x60\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe number of `Shared Runner Usage` minutes should approximately match the sum of minutes for all jobs in all pipelines in all repositories under the project group in an equivalent 1 month period\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-14T14:40:24.848Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T16:29:07.884Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T15:39:35.714Z","closed_by":{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"},"labels":["Application Limits","CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","Verify::P2","devops::verify","frontend","group::pipeline execution","priority::2","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"}],"author":{"id":109026,"username":"berrange","name":"Daniel P.

Rules in Deployment Approval UI","description":"## Release notes\n\nIn this release, we are adding additional key information for multiple approval rules in the approval UI. Now during the workflow of approving a deployment, you can see who has already approved and how many approvals are still needed and from which groups. This key information enables transparency and context for making the approval decision and also ensures compliance during an audit review.\n\n## Problem\n\nIn the initial [MVC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343864), **both** Deployment Executors and Deployment Approvers were managed in the [**same** access level](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#protecting-environments). This could be a problem that Approvers can accidentally gain an access to the critical environment, where they are supposed to approve/reject only. To resolve the problem, we should separate access levels between executors and approvers. For example:\n\n* Production Environment:\n  * Who can deploy?: @operator-group\n  * Needs approval for deployment?:\n    * At least one approval from @qa-tester-group\n    * At least one approval from @security-group\n\nIn [the previous issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345678), we added a API-basis support for the Multi Access Levels. In this issue, we extend the feature to frontend part, so that users can easily interact with the multi access levels.\n\n## Design\n\n- Add in table with approvers, approvals, approved by to give those viewing the modal the appropriate information and history behind who has approved, and who still needs to approve.\n- **Not in scope for this issue:** Cleaning up the comments section will be done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372377+\n\n| New Modal | \n| ------ | \n| ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-01_at_10.26.16_AM](/uploads/07504ccfe3ea63d2fb33d9a5f97c630a/Screen_Shot_2022-09-01_at_10.26.16_AM.png) | \n\n- **Note:** The Modal is getting busy! Moving information out of the modal will be handled in: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360503+\n- [Modal with all variations can be found here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355708/designs/Support_Approval_Rules_in_Deployment_Approval_UI.png)\n\n#### [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/JlpmnqHTSWvet6ijToZjDc/Show-multiple-deployment-approval-comments?node-id=28%3A5032)\n\n## Technical Proposal\n\n* For the project with Multiple Approval Rules, we show the proposed interface.\n  * We can send this flag to frontend via [EnvironmentHelper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/helpers/ee/environments_helper.rb).\n    * Condition: `deployment.environment.required_approval_count \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 deployment.environment.has_approval_rules? == true`\n  * If this is true, frontend requests to the [GraphQL query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/97102#query-example). Alternatively, frontend can call [Public API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deployments.html#get-a-specific-deployment), however, it doesn't include user avators.\n* For the project with Unified Approval Setting, we show the previous interface.\n  * I think this is necessary to avoid the disturbance in existing projects.\n  * We can send this flag to frontend via [EnvironmentHelper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/helpers/ee/environments_helper.rb).\n    * Condition: `deployment.environment.required_approval_count \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 deployment.environment.has_approval_rules? == false`\n  * If this is true, frontend fetches the data from `deployment_approval_data` (i.e. no change)\n  * Reference:

The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations.

For users who have projects within a group you can see the total SaaS runner usage for all the projects in the group but cannot break down the usage by project so you can make that project's pipeline more efficient.\n\nNow you can see a breakdown of SaaS runner usage by each project within a group the same as you can within your personal namespace.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nAs a group admin I want to see SaaS runner duration by project, so I can tell which projects use all my CI minutes.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the same graph `Usage by project` and table with project, saas runner usage, ci minutes columns to Group \u003e Usage Quotas.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n\n### Feature Usage Metrics\n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature?

[Project Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html). \n\nWhen you try to invite one of these users, you receive an error stating `is not included in the list` and the bot user is not added:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-03-11_at_11.20.48_AM](/uploads/777dffc94ecbfa98bda49ca99e0e4d75/Screen_Shot_2022-03-11_at_11.20.48_AM.png)\n\nShould you be able to add these bot users as members?\n* If so, it's not working (or maybe there are future plans to add this functionality?)\n* If not, can we just filter them out from the search here?\n  * Worst case, we have a regression with regards to name display and they could leak some data (ex token name)\n  * Otherwise, they're just noise and clutter\n  * The `is not included in the list` error message is not easy to understand and could be improved upon.\n\nIt is worth noting that the member invite modal is properly redacting the token name to `****` unless you have access to the project its a member of.\n\n## Plan\n\nHere is what I think we should do to resolve this\n\n- [x] Trim users from the dropdown in the invite modal to drop project bots from another project...or any project as they should already be members anyway?\n   * project bots can only belong to the project they were created for it [seems](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/0067aaa29185c28552e366283cfe8a8e05007f32/app/models/member.rb#L56-56)\n   * looks like token mgmt is handled via `/-/settings/access_tokens` route and is merely listed on the members page without the ability to change, remove, etc that member. We should likely trim project bots from our invite members modal as the `/-/settings/access_tokens` handles those.\n   * https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83651\n- [x] Enhance the messaging when the policy denies the update [here](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/f5269a7d223fa76ac6b4d6f986d5f985b7b03a3d/app/services/members/creator_service.rb#L39-39).

Our current vertical alignment is `middle`, which is the default for the markdown language. \n\nAs the cell text gets longer, it's even harder to follow it with your eye. Content in some cells may not even be initially in view when other cell content has a large height.\n\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Turn on top to be the default alignment\n- In the future, allow picking the alignment, once markown supports it. Track [issue](https://github.com/thombashi/pytablewriter/issues/13) in GitHub\n\nA left to right, top to bottom reading order will provide the best readability for tables with longer content ([F-pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/)).

Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the feature `trigger:forward`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213729) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_trigger_forward_variables` feature flag.\n\n- Introduced in: !82676\n- Improved in: !84478\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline authoring\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-authoring`\n- Best individual to reach out to: `@furkanayhan`\n- PM: `@dhershkovitch`\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect nothing changed unless [the new keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#triggerforward) is used.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf we did something wrong, bridge/trigger jobs might not pass variables to the downstream pipelines.\n\nWe can disable the feature flag.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n_Consider mentioning checks for 5xx errors or other anomalies like an increase in redirects \n(302 HTTP response status)_\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_trigger_forward_variables true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_trigger_forward_variables true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_trigger_forward_variables \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_trigger_forward_variables \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_trigger_forward_variables true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_trigger_forward_variables`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_trigger_forward_variables` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n        - [ ] Remove FF toggling logics from related E2E tests https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84438#note_913471709\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_trigger_forward_variables --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_trigger_forward_variables --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_trigger_forward_variables`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_trigger_forward_variables false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-11T08:21:24.117Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T07:33:17.962Z","closed_at":"2022-05-26T07:33:17.945Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355572","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":51,"completed_count":7},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"7 of 51 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355572","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355572/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355572/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#355572","relative":"#355572","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#355572"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104583294,"iid":355539,"project_id":278964,"title":"GitLab for Jira app: update browser alert with new copy","description":"Originally discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81126#note_860426101.\n\nWith the rollout of OAuth authentication in the GitLab for Jira app, cross-site cookies will no longer be an issue.

Redirect Vulnerability","description":"**[HackerOne report #1506126](https://hackerone.com/reports/1506126)** by `stealthy` on 2022-03-10, assigned to @nmalcolm:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\nThere is an open redirect on `https://gitlab.com/\u003cwhatever you want\u003e/@@\u003cattacker url\u003e` which can be used to redirect unsuspecting users to a malicious location.\n\n### What is an open redirect?\n\n\u003e Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.\n\u003e \n\u003e Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts may have a more trustworthy appearance. Unvalidated redirect and forward attacks can also be used to maliciously craft a URL that would pass the application's access control check and then forward the attacker to privileged functions that they would normally not be able to access.\n\u003e \n\u003e https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\n\n## Original Report\n\nThe original report shows how a BitBucket flaw can lead to BitBucket account takeover, but the HackerOne researcher and three appsec engineers were unable to turn it into a GitLab account takeover. That leaves just the open redirect.\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e Click here to expand the original report\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n## GitLab-safe How To Reproduce\n\nDon't use the researcher's infrastructure.\n\n1. Create a fresh GitLab.com and BitBucket.org account, if you don't have test ones already\n1. Visit `https://4a4e6bbf.gitlab.io/test` which @nmalcolm created as a GitLab-controlled PoC\n1. Observe the exposed authentication token\n\n\u003e `https://4a4e6bbf.gitlab.io/#access_token=\u003e\u003eREDACTED\u003c\u003c\u0026scopes=project+wiki+pullrequest+issue+account\u0026state=REDACTED\u0026expires_in=7200\u0026token_type=bearer`\n\nThe AppSec group have been added as maintainers to https://gitlab.com/4a4e6bbf so they can view / edit the PoC.\n\n---\n\n#####  Summary\n\nI bypassed Bitbucket OAuth login flow to harvest the token.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the exploit.\n\nThis is the redirect_uri parameter where `https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback` is whitelisted.  \n```  \nredirect_uri=https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback  \n```\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.17.46_AM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/6aaab77b-dde8-4ec6-b556-9c356fa22ef8/Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.17.46_AM.png)\n\nHowever, some content is allowed after /callback. The problem is that slashes are blacklisted including the Apache colon trick.\n\n* https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callbackasdfsd --\u003e Allowed  \n* https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback/.. --\u003e Blocked  \n* https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback/..; --\u003e Blocked\n\nHowever, the there is a bypass if the colon comes first. However, the server does not process this because anything after the colon is stripped.\n\n* https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback;/../ --\u003e Allowed\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.24.00_AM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/3f494519-c19f-439d-aa20-b46691896ca7/Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.24.00_AM.png)\n\nThe malicious data needs to be URL encoded for this to work correctly. However, a URL encoded colon followed by the string `/../` is blocked. Additionally, the colon traversal trick `/..;/` will not work either. Different permutations with meaningless characters in between does not work either.\n\n*  https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback%3b/../ --\u003e Blocked  \n*  https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback%3b/..;/ --\u003e Blocked  \n*  https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback%3baaa/..;/ --\u003e Blocked  \n*  https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback%3b/..;aaaa/ --\u003e Blocked\n\nIs this really solvable? Yes, there is a way using backslashes which are transformed into forward slashes later in the OAuth flow.\n\n* https://gitlab.com/users/auth/bitbucket/callback%3b\\..\\..\\..\\\u0026\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.28.59_AM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/f44e8ba3-f82d-44f4-a099-9604831c4623/Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.28.59_AM.png)\n\nNow, I chain this with an open redirect and the have the following payload.\n\n* https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fusers%2Fauth%2Fbitbucket%2Fcallback%3b%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5cjira%5c@[@]stealthy.com%5c\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.30.32_AM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/347ab392-719f-4d62-80fb-9bbd0dcc3b6b/Screen_Shot_2022-03-10_at_1.30.32_AM.png)  \n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n\n1 - Go to GitLab login and click Log in with Bitbucket.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWe will add the \"approve deployment\" button to the Environments detail view. The button should be added to the button-group component, that already exists in the UI.\n\n#### Out of scope\n\n- Showing the approval status in the UI\n- Showing the approval comment in the UI https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354508\n\n### User journey\n\nAfter a user configures deployment approvals to execute an approval or rejection of a deployment to an environment, they create a new deployment that is up for approval. Once the job for the approval starts, a new notification is sent to the approver (backend event), informing that a new item is ready for review. The approver navigates from the notification to the Environments detail page (frontend) on GitLab, where they see an option to approve or reject the deployment.\n\n#### Prototypes\n\n[:star: SEE FIGMA PROTOTYPES](https://www.figma.com/file/LKh172zFLMRVgm7USV65GS/%23351713---Environment-detail-(Deployments)-page-redesign?node-id=12%3A8453)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nOur goal is to deliver the scope of the deployment approvals flow, without incorporating elements of the \"page redesign\" that is being validated with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1841. This issue is a follow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342180/ but it only adds the approval capability to the UI (including the optional comment feature https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342439). No other interface changes are planned for this iteration.\n\nThis page is currently built on HAML.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n\nPlease consider performing a threat model for the code changes that are introduced as part of this feature. To get started, refer to our Threat Modeling handbook page https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/threat_modeling/#threat-modeling.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out to the Application Security Team (`@gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec`) to discuss any security concerns.\n--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\nYes, this will require a documentation update.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### Available Tier\n\n\u003c!-- This section should be used for setting the appropriate tier that this feature will belong to. Pricing can be found here: https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/\n\n* Free\n* Premium/Silver\n* Ultimate/Gold\n--\u003e\n\n~\"GitLab Premium\" \n\n### Feature Usage Metrics\n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature? Think about user behavior and their interaction with the product. What indicates someone is getting value from it?\n\nCreate tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n\n--\u003e\n\nNumber of unique users approving/rejecting deployments from the detail page\nNumber of approvals/rejections from the detail page\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\nUsers approve/reject deployments from the detail page (adoption). Additionally, after https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342440+ is complete, we see approver users navigating from the TODO to the environment detail page and completing the pending approval (notification -\u003e env detail page -\u003e approval action funnel conversion).\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers --\u003e\n\n- [Alex - the Application Development Manager](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#alex---the-application-development-manager)\n- [Casey - the Release and Change Management Director](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#casey---the-release-and-change-management-director)\n- [Skyler - the Chief Information Security Officer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#skyler---the-chief-information-security-officer)\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\nNo.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003c!-- Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.\nUse the

For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing?

After this, we'll try to assess which hypotheses have the most potential and start designing around them.\n\nWe will be using a few different methods, but the backbone is Spotify’s Thoughtful Execution Framework ([article](https://spotify.design/article/from-gut-to-plan-the-thoughtful-execution-framework); [PDF how-to](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c1zhnszcah7h/71ixcjK1NotIRxz9TZW0M8/96da3c42168eebc9d9afa76386d795c8/The___Thoughtful_Execution___Framework_by_Annina_Koskinen.pdf); [mural template](https://app.mural.co/template/76e5b996-2b97-427e-b0ad-c5510c93dfe2/9a0c9447-9531-441a-a671-1718ae92d311)).\n\n\u003e Any problem or untapped opportunity can be solved in multiple ways. That’s why you need to create **multiple hypotheses** for each, and assess which one returns the most **impact**.\n\u003e \n\u003e There are many kinds of templates available on how to form a good hypothesis, but the key is to articulate which **change** you are introducing, what **effect** you expect it to have, and **why**. You need to be able to **measure** the effect, otherwise the hypothesis can't be **tested**.\n\n### Problem statement\n\n\u003e How might we help [Sasha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer) navigate and triage comments, findings, and changes?\n\n## 📚 Prep materials\n\n1.

Take `issues` as an example. When a user visits an issues list, we first look up `issues_sort` column and use the stored value if one exists:\n\n```  \n# app/controllers/concerns/sorting_preference.rb#7\n   def set_sort_order(field = sorting_field, default_order = default_sort_order)\n    set_sort_order_from_user_preference(field) ||\n      set_sort_order_from_cookie(field) ||\n      params[:sort] ||\n      default_order\n  end\n```\n\nHowever, the same sort option may not be supported across all views that display an issues list. One example is sorting issues by weight. Because Weight is a ~\"GitLab Premium\" feature, we need to check for its availability for a namespace and we've been only supporting the sort option in group and project issues list.\n\n\n```rb\n# ee/app/helpers/ee/sorting_helper.rb#45\n      if viewing_issues \u0026\u0026 (@project || @group)\u0026.licensed_feature_available?(:issue_weights)\n        options.concat([weight_option])\n      end\n```\n\nThe issues list that appears in the dashboard can display issues coming from multiple namespaces. We leave out the weight sort here because checking for the feature availability can be expensive and complicated. So we should not use the sort value `weight` cached in `issues_sort` or cookie (it was the root cause of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6546. Also see the demos in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82558.)\n\n\nIn addition, we may want to consider falling back to using the first available sort option when rendering a sort dropdown instead of raising an error (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78708#note_838591859).","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-10T05:24:04.535Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T14:19:23.144Z","closed_at":"2022-06-06T06:55:10.602Z","closed_by":{"id":10216431,"username":"syarynovskyi","name":"Serhii Yarynovskyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10216431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/syarynovskyi"},"labels":["auto updated","backend","devops::plan","frontend","group::acquisition","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":10216431,"username":"syarynovskyi","name":"Serhii Yarynovskyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10216431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/syarynovskyi"}],"author":{"id":5961404,"username":"euko","name":"Eulyeon Ko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5961404/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/euko"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":10216431,"username":"syarynovskyi","name":"Serhii Yarynovskyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10216431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/syarynovskyi"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355148","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355148","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355148/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355148/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#355148","relative":"#355148","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#355148"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104519768,"iid":355137,"project_id":278964,"title":"GitHub Importer - Migrate pull request assigned reviewers","description":"## Release notes\n\nWhen importing projects from GitHub to GitLab, pull requests are imported as merge requests.
