Forks with open merge requests to each other can throw GitLab into an endless permission check loop","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nForks of projects with internal visibility with open merge requests\n\n1. allowing commits from members who can merge to the target branch\n1. targeting each other with the same branch name\n\nresult in a code loop when we check permissions for users who are not members of either projects.\n\n**This also results in the project's home page being unavailable.**\n\nThis was [reported](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/137641) (Zendesk, internal use only) by a 1,500-seat premium customer.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFirst, create a project `original/project-a` with visibility level `internal` and initialize repo with `README`.\n\nIn `original/project-a`:\n\n1. Edit `README.md` to add a line and commit the change to a new branch `test-branch`.\n1. Create a fork the project (We'll refer to this as `fork/project-a` going forward).\n\nIn `fork/project-a`:\n\n1. Edit `README.md` in `test-branch` to add a line and commit to the same branch.\n1. Create an MR with source `test-branch` and target `original/project-a:test-branch`. Check option `Allow commits from members who can merge to the target branch`.\n\nIn `original/project-a`:\n\n1. Create an MR with source `test-branch` and target `fork/project-a:test-branch`.  Check option `Allow commits from members who can merge to the target branch`.\n\nNow, log in as a user that is not a member of either project and browse to those project pages. You get a 500 error.\n\n### Example Project\n\nN/A\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n(What actually happens)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n(What you should see instead)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nHere's an annotated and abridged stack trace from when I attempt to open `https://gitlab.example.com/original/project-a`. My apologies in advance for the dank memes, I've spent several hours figuring this one out and needed some fun.\n\n```\napp/views/projects/_files.html.haml:10:in `_app_views_projects__files_html_haml___1234566409494462343_69929741437180'\napp/views/projects/show.html.haml:33:in `_app_views_projects_show_html_haml___3330509772191764956_69929735763260'\napp/views/projects/tree/_tree_header.html.haml:1:in `_app_views_projects_tree__tree_header_html_haml__3572462774810798508_69929742106660'\napp/controllers/concerns/checks_collaboration.rb:12:in `can_collaborate_with_project?'\n```\n\nAll good so far. This is the entry point of the loop.\n\n```\nlib/gitlab/user_access.rb:70:in `can_push_to_branch?'\napp/models/project.rb:2179:in `branch_allows_collaboration?'\napp/models/project.rb:2412:in `block (3 levels) in fetch_branch_allows_collaboration'\n```\n\nHere, we do:\n\n```ruby\n        merge_requests_allowing_collaboration(branch_name).any? do |merge_request|\n          merge_request.can_be_merged_by?(user)\n        end\n```\n\nNote: At this point, `branch_name` is `nil`. And for reference, from `app/models/project.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n  has_many :source_of_merge_requests, foreign_key: 'source_project_id', class_name: 'MergeRequest'\n```\n\n```ruby\n  def merge_requests_allowing_collaboration(source_branch = nil)\n    relation = source_of_merge_requests.opened.where(allow_collaboration: true)\n    relation = relation.where(source_branch: source_branch) if source_branch\n    relation\n  end\n```\n\nBecause we have an open merge request from `fork/project-a`, from here on, we're operating in the context of a `merge_request` object from `fork/project-a`.\n\n```\napp/models/merge_request.rb:1078:in `can_be_merged_by?'\n```\n\n```ruby\n  def can_be_merged_by?(user)\n    access = ::Gitlab::UserAccess.new(user, project: project)\n    access.can_update_branch?(target_branch)\n  end\n```\n\nUh oh. We just passed the `merge_request`'s `project` to `Gitlab::UserAccess`, meaning we just switched contexts from the original project to the forked project and `target_branch` as passed is `test-branch`.\n\n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3se2U9ZAJr7DW/giphy.gif)\n\n```\nlib/gitlab/user_access.rb:63:in `can_update_branch?'\nlib/gitlab/user_access.rb:70:in `can_push_to_branch?'\n```\n\nHere's what we are doing in `lib/gitlab/user_access.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n    request_cache def can_push_to_branch?(ref)\n      return false unless can_access_git?\n      return false unless project\n\n      return false if !user.can?(:push_code, project) \u0026\u0026 !project.branch_allows_collaboration?(user, ref) ### This\n\n      if protected?(ProtectedBranch, project, ref)\n        protected_branch_accessible_to?(ref, action: :push)\n      else\n        true\n      end\n    end\n```\n\nNow we're checking `test-branch` on `fork/project-a`.\n\n![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/2aNMNAPUVqQNeoL2X3/giphy.gif)\n\n```\napp/models/project.rb:2179:in `branch_allows_collaboration?'\napp/models/project.rb:2406:in `fetch_branch_allows_collaboration'\napp/models/project.rb:2412:in `block (3 levels) in fetch_branch_allows_collaboration'\n```\n\nThis should look familiar! We're back here again:\n\n```ruby\n        merge_requests_allowing_collaboration(branch_name).any? do |merge_request|\n          merge_request.can_be_merged_by?(user)\n        end\n```\n\nThis time, we're operating in the context of `fork/project-a` and `branch_name` is now `test-branch`. And since we have an open merge request from `original/project-a` also targeting `test-branch`, now we're going to run `#can_be_merged_by?` on that.\n\n```\napp/models/merge_request.rb:1078:in `can_be_merged_by?'\n```\n\n```ruby\n  def can_be_merged_by?(user)\n    access = ::Gitlab::UserAccess.new(user, project: project)\n    access.can_update_branch?(target_branch)\n  end\n```\n\nAnd now we're back to another iteration, this time on `original/project-a`.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3rgXBH2gQgG4ZsDeww/giphy.gif)\n\nWe get bounced between `fork/project-a` and `original/project-a` endlessly, until Ruby decides it has had enough.\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis happens in v12.4.2-ee.

Specifically, the `cve` property is confusing, as it does not actually contain CVE data, and as a result it should be removed. Anyone leveraging the `cve` property in the security reports, with custom scripts or as an integrator into our Secure features, you will need to stop using the `cve` property.\n\n- [x] [Release Post](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/41791#16258eba9f7a075f106c9db09de3eb65949f19f1)\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\nBased on [feedback from vendors testing integrations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMAz00jrDJNm41MOUZo_7-PAINN3l3cnS9jKt_t1D1o/edit), the `cve` property is confusing because it is not really a CVE; this is a compare key really.  Also, many types of findings won't be CVEs so this further confuses the issue.\n\nCurrently, the [common library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) uses the [CompareKey](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/blob/v2.5.3/issue/issue.go#L14) to [sort vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/blob/v2.5.3/issue/report.go#L22) having the same severity, and to [reference a vulnerability](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/blob/v2.5.3/issue/remediation.go#L12) from a remediation (auto-remediation result). It also provides code to [automatically set the compare key](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/blob/v2.5.3/issue/dependency_scanning.go#L15) of a vulnerability reported by Dependency Scanning.\n\nAuto-remediation for Dependency Scanning has been implemented in Gemnasium, and currently it only supports Yarn. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/merge_requests/5/diffs\n\nAuto-remediation for Container Scanning is currently under review. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/merge_requests/18\n\n### Proposal\n\nDeprecate the `cve` property, replace it with a `id` to be used in the `remediation.fixes` as a reference for which vulnerabilities get fixed by that remediation.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] update the [common library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common); see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common/-/merge_requests/79\n  - add new, automatically generated `id` field when encoding vulnerabilities to JSON\n  - add code comments to deprecate `Issue.CompareKey` and `Ref.CompareKey`, but keep encoding these fields to JSON\n  - add new `id` field to the vulnerability references, in remediation object\n- [ ] update all analyzers to the new version of the `common` library, so that they generate the `id` field when encoding vulnerabilities to JSON\n- update analyzers that implement auto-remediation so that they reference vulnerabilities by id\n  - [x] update [analyzers/klar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar); see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/-/merge_requests/31\n  - [x] update [analyzers/gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium); see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/64\n- [x] update shared templates used during QA for SAST and DS, and ignore the `id` when comparing the vulnerabilities; see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/85\n\nNot covered in this issue:\n- updating the Rails ~backend to handle the new `id` property: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209851\n- migrate the vulnerability feedback to not use `cve`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/205489.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] Update `Reports JSON Format` section in user documentation of DS, CS, and SAST https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29133\n- [x] Update [Secure Scanner Integration](/doc/development/integrations/secure.md) documentation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/29146\n\n### Testing\n\nThis requires E2E integration, to make sure the Rails ~backend can process new reports where the `cve` field has been removed. We've got to make sure that auto-remediation results are properly presented in the GitLab UI, for the expected vulnerabilities. This is covered by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209851 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/205489.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nNew version of JSON common security report format that includes replacement for `cve` field.

solve\n\nWhen auditing my users, I want to run a function in on an API, so I can get a list of users taking up a license seat (billable users).\n\n### Task:\n\n- [ ] Add parameter to the [GitLab admin users API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#for-admins) that would confirm whether a user is using a license seat (whether the user is billable). i.e `using_license_seat`\n\nFor reference, confirming the users that should take up a license seat: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/user.rb#L271\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nAdministrator\n\n### Possible future iterations\n\n- A way to look up billable users and their activity to determine whether the user is inactive\n- A report of inactive users\n- A way to bulk block/delete/deactivate the inactive users\n\n### Testing \u0026 Availability\n1. new search filter `using_license_seat=true` added to `api/v4/users` endpoint\n1. filter only applicable with admin access\n1. `using_license_seat` filter returns expected result when combined with other filters, e.g. `search=`, `order_by=`, and pagination filters.\n1. does not return duplicate records when user belongs different billable projects/groups\n1. result does not include inactive, ghost and bot users.\n1. guest user result is based on subscription's feature\n1. when filter set to `using_license_seat=false` it returns all users for admin\n1. does not affect existing behavior of `POST`, `GET` request to `api/v4/users` when filter is not applied","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-19T18:05:24.929Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T21:10:07.105Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T08:32:30.458Z","closed_by":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James

search for full name in mentions in comments","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen trying to mention a user, I should be able to search by the user's full name and not just the full username / first name. The current behaviour doesn't allow that \n\n### Intended users\n\nAnyone who comments on issues / MRs.\n\n### Further details\n\nIncluding an internal conversation on Slack (edited for brevity):\n\n```\nsstern  13 hours ago\nis there a ticket to @ a user and search for a combination of their name and username? Some users have a username that doesnt logically map to their full name and it makes it difficult to @ someone if you know their name but not their exact username\n\ncharlie:charlieshat:  12 hours ago\nI had this issue yesterday. I ended up searching via the assignment box :sweat_smile:\n\nsstern  11 hours ago\nya it happens to me in issues a lot, its like what was their user name? If you only type 1 char too it returns nothing.\nThe assignment box doesn't search by name does it?\n\ncharlie:charlieshat:  10 hours ago\nIt does! Give it a go :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nsstern  10 hours ago\nawesome, we should make a ticket to add that to the comments\n\ncharlie:charlieshat:  10 hours ago\nI suspect that we use a mentions library and it might involve an upstream PR. :thinking_face: please raise one anyway!\n\nsstern  10 hours ago\nthanks for the context!\n:charlieshat:\n\nheinrich  10 hours ago\nI think it already does, even in the comment boxes\n\nsstern  10 hours ago\nso… playing with it it looks like it matches first name but if there are n “Paul’s” and i type Paul Space start last name that does not work\n\nheinrich  10 hours ago\nYeah, space is tricky because it would be like the end of a mention\n\nheinrich  10 hours ago\nSame thing happens for label names with spaces\n\nsstern  10 hours ago\nso if there were 100 Heinrichs, and its limiting 5, and you were number 6\n\nsstern  10 hours ago\nsee my point?\n\ncharlie:charlieshat:  10 hours ago\n:thinking_face: I think the behaviour is different. Yes, the space is treated as the end of the word. I use the assignee search if I give up in the comment mentions - it’s definitely easier since it’s more dedicated.\n\nheinrich  10 hours ago\nYeah, the assignee search uses the whole term there because we know the whole string is for the assignee\n\ncharlie:charlieshat:  10 hours ago\nNot sure what the answer is here, it’s definitely an interesting UX problem, and probably worth bringing up as an issue.\n\ncharlie:charlieshat:  10 hours ago\nthank you so much for further context @heinrich :heart:\n\nJustin Ho  4 hours ago\nProbably a good question to ask UX about. Maybe something like Slack would be nice? Where as long as you start typing @, it begins a mention search even after clicking space. To stop it, you just click escape or continue typing. It even highlights the @mention with a tooltip indicating it might be an invalid mention.\n```\n\n### Proposal\n- We can use a Slack-like mention, where once you type the `@` character, the search continues even after you click space. You can dismiss the search with the `Esc` key.\n- We can allow to search for name without spaces. For example, if I search for `@justinho`, it should still return my account even though it doesn't match my username exactly (but it matches my name).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nNo change.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nMentions allow for a wider search scope and are easier to use.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\nIndividual Contributors\n\n### Links / references\n\n### Release Notes\n\nIt's uncommon for GitLab users to use their full name as their username. This makes it painfully difficult to find the individuals you want to `@` mention because the autocomplete only matches against usernames. As a first step towards [making autocomplete smarter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207134), you can now search for people to mention based on their username or full name.\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/issue_data_and_actions.html#mentions\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-19T07:21:43.693Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:04:23.102Z","closed_at":"2021-02-18T14:30:03.657Z","closed_by":{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","Deliverable","cm-scorecard-rec","devops::plan","direction","documentation","frontend","group::project management","missed-deliverable","missed:13.7","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production","🍉"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"}],"author":{"id":4704683,"username":"justin_ho","name":"Justin Ho Tuan Duong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4704683/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/justin_ho"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4545397,"username":"cngo","name":"Coung Ngo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4545397/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cngo"},"user_notes_count":32,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36705","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36705","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36705/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36705/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36705","relative":"#36705","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36705"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4104,"epic":{"id":89934,"iid":4104,"title":"Team Planning Category Maturity - Complete","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4104","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27199245,"iid":36702,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Enable storing of description versions","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## What\n\nRemove the `:save_description_versions` feature flag.\n\nThis is related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/10103\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"devops::plan\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#s_plan`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @engwan / @fatihacet / @felipe_artur \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n## Beta groups/projects\n\nIf applicable, any groups/projects that are happy to have this feature turned on early.

Hacker logged in into gitlab.com with victim's email address  \n4. Go to https://gitlab.com/profile to change the victim's email to hacker's email (hacker@email.com)  \n5. Hacker receive link confirmation on email (on hacker@email.com)  \n6. Done. Now victim want to register victim@email.com to gitlab and fail. So victim reset his password using forget password feature.  \n7. Then victim can login successfully after reset his password  \n8. When attacker know it, attacker visit the link on 5th step and change the email to hacker@email.com again  \n9. Attacker reset the password  \n10.

The first 30 days worth of data will be used for computing the rolling median and the second 30 days worth of data will need to be used to compute the plottable points on the duration chart.\n\nThe median line data needs to be fetched in a separate series of API requests in order to avoid slowing down displaying the duration chart.\n\nAll logic and API requests for the median line will be placed behind a feature flag `cycle_analytics_scatterplot_median_enabled`\n\nAdding a limit to the date range which is selectable will be handled in a separate issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/119111\n\n![Screenshot_2019-09-25_at_14.25.59](/uploads/38bd497fe1814b3b2832469aafe82751/Screenshot_2019-09-25_at_14.25.59.png)\n\n#### From original issue\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12183\n\n \u003e Let's have a scatterplot with the specific day of completion on the x-axis and number of days it took from `X` to `Y` as our first attempt to answer the question as to whether people are getting better with time. The chart should contain a trend line (rolling median - 30 days?)+ 25-75% quantile bands. We should have a dropdown where a user can select which stage they want to look at and they should be able to select more than one, so that the trend line will be the sum of days for those stages selected. We can have different color dots representing the different stages. If this looks too messy, we can combine the stages in 1 dot.\n\nBased on the above extract, we agreed on a single plottable point per stage and only a rolling median line.

not marked as `stored_externally`, stalling the background migration. After a while of enabling the external diffs feature, the `MergeRequests::MigrateExternalDiffsService` will enqueue the same set of `MergeRequestDiff` records over and over again because `stored_externally` is not set to `true` for them.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nJudging by the behavior observed on staging, just create 1000 MRs with no diffs, then run `MergeRequests::MigrateExternalDiffsService.enqueue!`. They won't be marked as `stored_externally`.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`MergeRequestDiff` whose `merge_request_diff_files.count == 0` are skipped by the migration.\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nEither mark the record as `stored_externally` or use a special flag that exclude them from `MergeRequestDiff.ids_for_external_storage_migration`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-18T13:22:51.125Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T16:47:53.006Z","closed_at":"2019-11-25T14:37:19.150Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Object Storage","Stuff that should Just Work","Unscheduled","devops::create","group::code review","merge requests","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":506061,"username":"ahmadsherif","name":"Ahmad Sherif","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6d0ec4213b91601956c9f801cbfe9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmadsherif"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36646","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36646","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36646/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36646/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36646","relative":"#36646","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36646"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27160228,"iid":36639,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove feature flag for share groups with groups","description":"`share_group_with_group` feature flag was introduced with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/18328 to let us deliver the feature in smaller increments.

This means, the Grafana settings also can be configured on project level.  \nWhen going to the settings, the owner or maintainer of a project has to enter the Grafana URL and the Grafana API token.\n\nWhen visiting the settings page again, the API token is presented again. Thus any other maintainer can grab the Grafana token and possibly abuse it.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a new project.  \n2. Go to `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/-/settings/operations`  \n3. Activate Grafana by adding an URL, and add a token  \n4. Add another maintainer to the project and as this user, revisit `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/-/settings/operations` and see the leaking token\n\nAlso view the attached screenshot showing this:  \n![Screenshot_20191113_195318.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8276bb38-3b71-40af-8928-e75a14ae168d/Screenshot_20191113_195318.png)\n\n### Impact\n\nThe Grafana API key is leaked to other maintainers. This is problematic because a different maintainer can simply copy this token.  \nWhen this maintainer is removed from the project, this user is still in possession of the API key. Grafana even only shows the token once (as it should be), but GitLab renders them unmasked.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe GitLab settings page leaks the Grafana API token to other maintainers by showing them in plaintext.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen using tokens, do not present them in plain. Use a masked version of it.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\nBest regards,  \nXanbanx\n\n## Impact\n\nSee above.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screenshot_20191113_195318.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/8276bb38-3b71-40af-8928-e75a14ae168d/Screenshot_20191113_195318.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-18T11:12:47.097Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T17:41:28.280Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T21:58:35.863Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Metrics","Deliverable","HackerOne","backend","devops::monitor","group::respond","priority::3","security","severity::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1001915,"iid":43,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:53:58.792Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:23:44.837Z","due_date":"2020-02-17","start_date":"2020-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/43"},"assignees":[{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-01-24","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36632","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36632","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36632/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36632/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36632","relative":"#36632","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36632"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27156654,"iid":36628,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create a rake task to cleanup unused LFS files","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUsers or admins run up against storage limits, and realize that they are using a lot of storage on LFS objects they no longer want or need. Then they find there is no way to remove them from the GitLab-managed LFS storage without deleting the project.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n\nThe Git repo is the SSOT, but the data is elsewhere, only tracked by project. So in order to know if you can delete the data, you have to scan the repo or have been tracking the pointers the whole time.\n\n#### Ideal solution\n\nTrack pointers the whole time and automatically delete objects when unreferenced. It is technically possible, and it is the most user-friendly solution. We started down this road in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/14479. But this is a large, complex MR, and from my limited understanding, more than weight 5. Especially including performance validation etc. There are apparently a lot of performance risks and pitfalls. Also it looks like existing repos weren't handled yet.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nRather than focusing on the ideal solution first, we can iterate using a boring solution:\nCreate a rake task to clean a single project in a non-performant way. Note that this would also allow us to validate our performance concerns. Maybe from there we could implement a way for project Maintainers to queue a clean, and run those single file. It's not ideal, but users would at least have some recourse. It is similar to how we handle [other cleanup tasks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/cleanup.html).\n\nThis was also proposed already in this comment: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/8922#note_244261646\n\nThe rake task could be `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:lfs_files`.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n* I believe this requires `sudo` access\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n* Add to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/cleanup.html\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n* Needs to be well tested because it otherwise may remove still needed data\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nA systems administrator can schedule to `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:lfs_files` on a per project basis e.g. over the weekend to remove LFS files that are no longer required.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n* All tiers\n\n### Links / references\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/17711\n* Release Post MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/35814","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-18T10:41:20.927Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T14:36:26.413Z","closed_at":"2020-03-23T09:19:05.902Z","closed_by":{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},"labels":["customer+","devops::systems","missed:12.6","missed:12.7","missed:12.8","release post item","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":3944199,"username":"fzimmer","name":"Fabian Zimmer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3944199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fzimmer"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":44,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36628","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36628","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36628/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36628/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36628","relative":"#36628","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36628"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":302,"epic":{"id":645,"iid":302,"title":"Make Git LFS loveable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/302","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27152332,"iid":36611,"project_id":278964,"title":"GitLab Container Registry repository names regex is not at parity with docker/registry","description":"### Summary\n\nOur `container_repository_name_regex` (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/1ce0e5a7bc241e4c5ea381b271cf789bfa4203ba/lib/gitlab/regex.rb#L22) is rejecting valid image repository names/paths, including those with a `--`.\n\nCompare against: https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/reference/regexp.go#L6-L20\n\nWe addressed this some time ago with:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/45104\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/62770\n\nBut we never came back to solve the root problem in the backend.\n\n[Reported](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/138947) (Zendesk, internal use only) by a 1,600-seat ultimate customer.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

This is a cumbersome process because 1) the flow can be time-consuming (needed for each individual fix one-by-one) and 2) when solutions are available: insight is not displayed or communicated to the user on the dashboard UI (it's only seen once the user selects to see vulnerability details, see current UX flow below).\n\n| **Current UX/UI** | \n| ------ | \n| ![0](/uploads/bd841be6800625ada35d5dc85138b528/0.png) |\n\n:movie_camera: [view MVC walkthrough](https://youtu.be/pbRhf0LHgq8)\n* 0:00 - 1:26, context and current UX\n* 1:26 - 12:12, MVC review\n* 12:12 - end, resulting issues and next steps\n\n### Further details\n\n**Context:** This is a follow-up implementation issue to the `auto-remediation` discovery https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/14059. This implementation focuses on `auto-creation of merge requests` with known solutions. There is ~\"UX research\" https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/530 underway looking at this MVC and to inform our upcoming [discovery](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36503), which is focused on `auto-merging auto-created merge requests`. Current auto-remediation capabilities will affect projects that are using dependency scanning and using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). As we evolve the UX for auto-remediation our objective is for a 1) generic auto-remediation UX that handles multiple capabilities (consistent UX across different capabilities) and 2) geting closer to out-of-box UX (meaning it works without configuration). Example of upcoming capability is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35433 (based on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/9384). \n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n\n### Proposal\n| **A. Activating feature:** If dependency and/or container scanning is configured the feature is opt-in by default. User may opt-out of the feature on the configuration screen. Option will be disabled is configuration is not complete.   | \n| ------ | \n| ![a](/uploads/a90a1c9395ad130857c139d6587abc8e/a.png) | \n\n| **B.

Findability of auto-created MRs:** The `auto-created` MRs will be created with a label assigned by the system: `GitLab-suggested-solution`. Also, could be found by the author `GitLab-Security-Bot`  | \n| ------ |\n| ![d](/uploads/e2a2724ef3a5f6235b92bc79eed8f89f/d.png) | \n\n| **E.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* User can easily setup the feature\n* User understands what current auto-fix capabilities are available\n* User can find `auto-created MRs`\n\nThese questions and more are in ~\"UX research\": https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/530\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" \n\n### Links / references\n\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n#### 1.

And it's too early - before all epics are processed -\u003e so lazy loading will not work as expected because we want to access epic issues *after* all of them are lazy-loaded. Ideally we want to avoid accessing lazy-loaded value until it's rendered.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19141 added support for epic issues lazy loading, but for now worked around the authorization system just by disabling authorization and calling epic issues authorization when rendering items. The benefit of this approach is that we filter/authorize only nodes which are going to be rendered. But to be able to filter items in this phase it introduces new type of connection - FilterableArrayConnection - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19141/diffs#d79211cf1f153d9923b2e35e6f86fcb95842be29_0_10 which extends default GraphQL Array connection but assures that items are filtered (by calling a proc) before being rendered (calling `paged_nodes` method).\n\nOne direction I tried was using `.then` method (https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/GraphQL/Execution/Lazy#then-instance_method) which in theory has a potential to avoid defining FilterableArray. IOW we would just wrap evaluation of lazy method with additional `proc` which would be clean. There are couple of obstacles though:\n\n* it's a private API method\n* we want to filter all issues at once instead of each of them separately\n\nI think this is an area where we could iterate on and eventually propose an upstream change which would allow to do filtering on lazy evaluation for only rendered items :thinking:\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19141#note_244440561","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-15T13:59:08.279Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T07:42:57.256Z","closed_at":"2021-04-06T07:42:57.153Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["GraphQL","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","bug::performance","devops::plan","group::product planning","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","workflow::solution validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

(Background and context)\n\n[Block merge request with a negative approval signal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/761), a five year old issue, is one of the most popular feature requests for Code Review, requested by at least 4 customers. The problem statement is:\n\n\u003e As a project maintainer or senior developer, when I am reviewing merge requests I may see a merge request that is problematic and needs significant work before it can be merged. It may not be a code quality problem but it might conflict with other work that is currently happening in a different team that other eligible approvers may be unaware of. I want to be able **block** (negative approval) a merge request so that it doesn't get approved and merged by other team members.\n\nA customer is interested enough that they are willing to implement the blocking behavior themselves (see related customer issue).\n\nHowever, we don't have any plans to allow blocking activities, nor is that something we've historically been very willing to see in the product. We're also very hesitant to add [new configuration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#convention-over-configuration) to the product as that can make it more complicated for new users and introduces less optimal workflows.\n\n#### What are the overarching goals for the research?\n\nIdentify and validate the problem behind [Block merge request with a negative approval signal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/761), to understand if it's a problem worth pursuing and what we need to be aware when developing a solution. This can help us guide community contributions in the right direction.\n\n#### What hypotheses and/or assumptions do you have?\n\n- Reviewers want to “block” an MR because they have a specific concerns about the MR that they would like to see addressed before the MR is merged.\n- When reviewers “block” an MR, they always try to share the “why” so that communication is clear and the team's work can be more efficient and effective.\n\n#### What research questions are you trying to answer?\n\n- What is the user's goal?\n- When does this problem occur?\n- What is the reach and impact of this problem?\n- What are the key parts of this problem?\n- What are the potential boring solutions to this problem?\n\n#### What, if any, relevant prior research already exists?\n\nSee related issues

The purpose of this issue is to implement parsers for all of the currently unsupported [Clair Vulnerability Data Sources](https://github.com/quay/clair/blob/master/Documentation/drivers-and-data-sources.md#data-sources-for-the-built-in-drivers):\n\n- [Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories) which have the format [RHSA-2019:3892](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3892).\n- [Oracle Linux Security Data](https://linux.oracle.com/security/) which have the format [ELSA-2017-1101](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2017-1101.html)\n- Possibly others?\n\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

[x] Once the code has been added to `identifier.go`, the corresponding workaround in the [container scanning project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/blob/dada0b5243f0d988a56e2c6c9d07ad20d833b860/convert/convert.go#L162-189) should be removed, and a new version of the container scanning tool should be tagged and pushed.\n    * https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/merge_requests/23\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

But you've been limited to using a project-level endpoint. For organizations with many projects or groups, this is quite inconvenient. You need to give your team a single URL for installing packages and don't want them to have to remember which package comes from where. \n\nGitLab Packages now supports a group/sub-group endpoint for pulling all of your group's NuGet packages. The endpoint currently supports downloading and searching for NuGet packages.\n\n### Problem to solve \nThe NuGet repository only allows you to publish and install packages to/from a specific project. This can be problematic for complex organizations that have many different projects nested inside of a group/sub-group. These organizations need an easy way to pull dependencies from their group. \n\n\n### Proposal \nHelp .NET/C# developers at larger organizations by introducing a group endpoint that will allow developers to install and search for packages amongst their entire group, not just a singular project. \n- Follow what we do for Maven: at the group level, locate the possible packages and return the one with the highest `id`. By avoiding the naming convention, we avoid more restrictions on the group level endpoint. [Maven packages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#group-level-maven-endpoint).\n- Only pull actions (install and search) will be supported. \n- Publishing packages will still be done with a project-level endpoint. Although they can be viewed in the group's package registry or using the [Packages API]()https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#within-a-group.\n\n### User experience goal\n- It's easy for teams to search for and install their group's NuGet dependencies### Documentation","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-14T22:18:34.930Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T08:24:47.560Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T12:41:03.701Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","NuGet Repository","Package:P1","customer","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","package:active","quad-planning::complete-action","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":64,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":28,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36423","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36423","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36423/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36423/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36423","relative":"#36423","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36423"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2271,"epic":{"id":15540,"iid":2271,"title":"GitLab NuGet (.NET) Repository","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2271","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27069691,"iid":36422,"project_id":278964,"title":"Use the Package Registry UI to view your NuGet packages' dependencies, tags and project URLs","description":"### Problem to solve\r\nThe GitLab NuGet Repository allows developers to build, publish, and share .NET packages, right alongside their source code and CI Pipelines.

solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\nUsers with serverless applications leveraging Knative are still exposed to security vulnerabilities but traditional security approaches primarily focus on classical, server focused use cases, rather than serverless. This means that users with serverless applications have to choose between using updating their app to a classic, server architecture to use security tools or use their serverless architecture without security tools in place.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nIn the future, GitLab will offer similar security capabilities, such as WAF, Threat Detection, and others, for serverless applications, much as we do for traditional Kubernetes applications.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nServerless use cases and technologies are relatively new, so this issue is proposing technical discovery for the team to learn about this space and identify next steps in terms of what we'll need to learn more about and how our security capabilities will relate to serverless use cases.\n\nSpecifically, this discovery should explore:\n\n* [ ] How would an app be deployed on serverless with GitLab \u0026 Knative?\n* [ ] What differences are there in using Knative compared with the traditional clusters GitLab has today?\n* [ ] Are our existing security tools, like WAF, Threat Detection, and `NetworkPolicy` objects able to be directly used with serverless use cases?\n   * [ ] If not, why can't they be used? Is there a reasonable path to adapting them? Do the problems they solve not apply in the serverless use case?\n* [ ] _Add other questions here organically_\n\nFollow-up issues should be created for each of these areas as necessary.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n* Answers to the questions above and technical decisions made\n* Follow-on issues created where necessary\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

[snippets dashboard](https://gitlab.com/snippets) the view [_snippets_scope_menu.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/views/snippets/_snippets_scope_menu.html.haml#L10) performs different queries to retrieve the `count` of snippets based on the `visibility_level`. \n\nBut this feels like it can be improved, besides depending on some conditions, we might perform more queries than we should.\n\nAt the moment, there is an index in the `visibility_level` and these `count` are performed on a scoped relation, therefore they aren't too critical (unless whether the user is an admin which will get more results).\n\nMy proposal is to add something like:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/models/snippet.rb b/app/models/snippet.rb\nindex fd1e3b5240c..e04839c869e 100644\n--- a/app/models/snippet.rb\n+++ b/app/models/snippet.rb\n@@ -81,6 +81,16 @@ class Snippet \u003c ApplicationRecord\n     end\n   end\n\n+  def self.visibility_counters\n+    select('\n+      count(case when visibility_level=20 and secret is FALSE then 1 else null end) as are_public,\n+      count(case when visibility_level=20 and secret is TRUE then 1 else null end) as are_secret,\n+      count(case when visibility_level=10 then 1 else null end) as are_internal,\n+      count(case when visibility_level=0 then 1 else null end) as are_private,\n+      count(case when visibility_level=20 OR visibility_level=10 then 1 else null end) as are_public_or_internal\n+    ').first.slice(:are_public, :are_secret, :are_private, :are_public_or_internal)\n+  end\n+\n   def self.only_personal_snippets\n     where(project_id: nil)\n   end\n```\n\nThis way we can retrieve all the counters at the same time. I think it is more performant than the former approach because we avoid the overhead of performing a PostgreSQL query, but I'm not sure how much will be the improvement.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-14T16:24:45.615Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T08:16:45.690Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T12:54:44.962Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["Category:Snippets","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","backend-weight::2","bug::performance","database","devops::create","frontend","group::editor"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

This strategy have different options for how you want to handle the stickiness, and have sane default mode.\n\n\nUnleash now supports a [flexible rollout

This is a regression introduced recently.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCI logs for my fork of gitlab.com/unboundedsystems/adapt show this issue. An example URL that shows the issue is https://gitlab.com/mterrel/adapt/-/jobs/350258360\n\n### Example Project\n\nPlease see mterrel/adapt. If I need to provide permissions, I'm happy to do that.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThis is a regression. The behavior was correct until recently.\n\nThe output shown on the job log web page, in the emulated terminal (with the black background) shows text colors that are different than if I download the job log from the \"Show complete raw\" button on that page and `cat` it in a terminal. Specifically, the output rendered in the browser's \"terminal\" shows large sections of green text and large sections of blue text that should be without non-standard color. See attached file for what the current behavior is:\n\n![actual_-_web_interface](/uploads/da0335c11c7fcf5f59bae07ad6c16ce6/actual_-_web_interface.png) \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe text colors of the output in the web browser \"terminal\" should look similar to what a standard ANSI-escape-sequence compatible terminal would show. Specifically, in the URL above for the mterrel/adapt project, it should look more like what is shown in the attached file:\n\n![expected_-_linux_terminal](/uploads/e8a46b62474e630bc1c82d350f9d67d7/expected_-_linux_terminal.png)\n\nThis screen capture is the downloaded \"Show complete raw\" file from the above URL displayed on a Linux terminal. Note that the following text SHOULD be blue and is CORRECT on both:\n```\n*****\n utils: build START\n*****\n```\nHowever, the next line should NOT be blue:\n```\nmake -C utils build\n```\nIt is correctly shown in normal (white) text in the expected screen cap, but is incorrectly shown in blue in the actual screen cap.\n\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nBuggy color behavior from web interface: ![actual_-_web_interface](/uploads/da0335c11c7fcf5f59bae07ad6c16ce6/actual_-_web_interface.png)\n\nCorrect color behavior from Linux terminal for same log: ![expected_-_linux_terminal](/uploads/e8a46b62474e630bc1c82d350f9d67d7/expected_-_linux_terminal.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-14T05:44:04.395Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T13:29:05.459Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T08:11:46.436Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","priority::2","regression","regression:12.5","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":843370,"username":"mterrel","name":"Mark Terrel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9f712de728dcc7b8e63a6cdd60a03c6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mterrel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36335","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36335","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36335/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36335/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36335","relative":"#36335","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36335"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27038189,"iid":36331,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update title parsing for eslint-react-plugin","description":"### Recommended approach\n\nWe should strip the urls (and any related text) from the title and add the urls to the Links section.

My first instinct was to intercept the \"Title\" so we could change it to something we control, but I didn't find any other instances where we were doing this, so wanted get feedback before proceeding on that.\n\nDashboard example:\n![Screen_Shot_2019-11-12_at_3.57.27_PM](/uploads/e7d80f6316d88a285148f26f31f01867/Screen_Shot_2019-11-12_at_3.57.27_PM.png)\n\nModal example:\n![Screen_Shot_2019-11-12_at_3.58.18_PM](/uploads/93ec4e8212a9d84d9904a4d7fe37b1f8/Screen_Shot_2019-11-12_at_3.58.18_PM.png)\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-14T04:57:07.101Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T07:11:06.635Z","closed_at":"2020-05-08T15:30:20.171Z","closed_by":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"labels":["Category:SAST","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","SAST: Common Need","SAST: Scanner Update","devops::secure","group::static analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:12.10","missed:12.5","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"}],"author":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":32707,"username":"rossfuhrman","name":"rossfuhrman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/32707/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rossfuhrman"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36331","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36331","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36331/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/36331/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#36331","relative":"#36331","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#36331"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27036653,"iid":36329,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Create a system note for new design discussions\"","description":"The following discussion from !19990 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @engwan started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19990#note_244381523):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e I looked at `Discussion#new_discussion?` and I think there can be a race condition here that would lead to no system note being created.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1.
