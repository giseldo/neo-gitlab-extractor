Not sure if this is a bug or still a WIP.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Add the container scanning results to the widget: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/extensions/security_reports/mr_widget_security_reports.vue#L143\n\n## Verification steps\n\n- [x] Follow the steps to setup this feature locally: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/103739#how-to-set-up-and-validate-locally\n- [x] Verify from the network tab that we're making a call to the `container scanning` endpoint that goes like: `/:namespace/:project/-/merge_requests/:mid/container_scanning_reports`","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-02T11:04:10.144Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T14:56:36.853Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T14:56:36.804Z","closed_by":{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Threat Insights::Navy","Track Health Status","auto updated","devops::govern","frontend","group::threat insights","merge request widget","ready to pull","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5535246,"username":"svedova","name":"Savas Vedova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535246/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/svedova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381263","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/381263","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/381263/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/381263/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#381263","relative":"#381263","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#381263"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8353,"epic":{"id":564248,"iid":8353,"title":"[MR Widget] V2","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8353","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":117979346,"iid":381231,"project_id":278964,"title":"Frontend: Add validation for the mask item value is part of URL","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/102720, we've already added presence validations to key / value of mask items.\n\nA nice improvement will be to make sure that the value is a part of the URL as well.

That doesn't sound right to me -- any Git repository needs to be optimized for performance every now and then, at least when it's receiving traffic.\n\nI'm not sure why Wikis were not implemented, but GroupWiki and Snippet Git repos were added later and if the idea came up I'm guessing it would have been low priority.\n\nIt should be easier now to implement the thing in one place, to handle Git repos generally in SSF. I'll open an issue.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nThis will also apply to Designs when they get migrated to SSF.

Then, it will re-enqueue itself.\n\nIn other words, the background job doing (2.) is looping until the _backlog_ of package files marked as `pending_destruction` is processed.\n\nThat's great but how do we kickstart the loop? Well, we do have a cron job that regularly check if the background job loop for (2.) need to be started.\n\nThe current cadence is super large: `12.hours`.

To learn more about the error, we can introduce logging of the request body.\n\nIn order not to log sensitive information, we can start by logging only the JSON schema and not the values.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-31T10:32:44.143Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T08:27:29.107Z","closed_at":"2022-12-01T08:18:37.044Z","closed_by":{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Deliverable","Integration::Jira","Jira::ConnectApp","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::integrations","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"}],"author":{"id":16943,"username":"Andysoiron","name":"Andy Soiron","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/16943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Andysoiron"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/379675","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379675","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379675/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379675/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#379675","relative":"#379675","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#379675"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1522,"epic":{"id":8628,"iid":1522,"title":"Jira Integration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1522","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":117845516,"iid":379671,"project_id":278964,"title":"Document SSH signing with 1Password","description":"An integration with 1Password has been developed and the request is to add documentation added to the GitLab developer guide.\n\n\u003e The main ask from Engineering here is that you consider mentioning this approach to SSH in your docs for [commit signing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/) and even [SSH in general. ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html).

- Maven Package Repo - 422 Unprocessable Entity Error","description":"## Summary\nWhen pushing a maven package to the repo using `mvn deploy`, a **422 Unprocessable Entity** Error is received and the package is not added to the package registry. \n\nIt appears that the following conditions must be present for the issue to occur:\n1) The GitLab server is running on Kubernetes installed using GitLab Helm Chart\n2) The non-FIPS UBI containers are being used\n3) The Kubernetes nodes for the server cluster are in FIPS mode\n\nThe error did not occur with the Debian k8s containers or omnibus running on a FIPS VM.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nFull details of environment setup and test:\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n1. Create an EC2 instance.  AMI: ubuntu-pro-fips-server/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-pro-fips-server-20220615-7bc828d1-c072-4d33-a989-fbad50380cfb\nami-04ebe04990712e030.  \n- Instance Size: m5.xlarge 4vcpu, 16 Gib Mem Security Group. Open 22, 80, 443, 6443\n\n2. Update and configure EC2 instance\n- `sudo apt update / upgrade`\n- `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname example.domain.com`\n- `sudo reboot now`\n\n3. Set up DNS entries\n- new DNS record (example.domain.com) pointing at ec2 instance\n- set wildcard record (*.example.domain.com) pointing at ec2 instance\n\n4. Install k3s \n- `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC=\"--disable traefik\" sh -s -`\n- Get kube config and move to the machine where you have kubectl and helm 3 installed\n- Update host names and/or file permissions for kube config as needed.\n\n5. Install GitLab Using Helm Chart - Use UBI8 containers for webservice and workhorse\n- `kubectl create namespace gitlab`\n- `helm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io/`\n- `helm repo update`\n- `helm upgrade --install gitlab gitlab/gitlab -n gitlab --set certmanager-issuer.email=email@address.com -f values.yaml`\n\n6. Fix Error: The webservice pod will not start - Error from dependencies init container: fe_sendauth: error sending password authentication\n- Get postgres password from secret\n- `kubectl exec -it gitlab-toolbox -n gitlab -- /bin/bash`\n- `psql -d gitlabhq_production -h gitlab-postgresql -u gitlab`\n- `SET password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256';`\n- `ALTER USER \"gitlab\" with password 'DB_PASSWORD_HERE\"`\n\n7. Set up gitlab for test\n- Log in as `root` with default password\n- Create a group\n- Create a project inside the group - blank with README.MD\n- Go to user settings and create a PAT\n\n8. Execute Test\n- Create a test maven package\n- Update pom.xml with test server URL and project ID\n- Update settings.xml with PAT\n- `mvn deploy`\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Configuration

This can/will cause confusion.\n\n\u003e For that reason, I think we should use a `bot-type` user account. We can give those accounts the exact privileges they need to do their job, but nothing more. And these accounts cannot be used to log in, so there is no risk of credentials leaking.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. Create a new `admin_bot` method similar to the methods defined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1b001c8272305785e0cc8a7ae11330903e0a89e5/app/models/user.rb#L842-901) and set `admin` as `true` for this bot. Also assign the avatar for bot as suggested provided by the product designer.\n2.

Unfortunately, the official javascript client, `kubernetes-client/javascript`, [does not support web browsers yet](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript/issues/165).\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [x] Create a project for the client under gitlab-org \u003c-- @hfyngvason\n- [x] Generate the client using the javascript generator \u003c-- @hfyngvason \n- [x] Publish the client in npm \u003c-- @anna_vovchenko \n- [-] Include it in `package.json` \u003c-- @anna_vovchenko (will be done within the first frontend MR)\n\n### Evaluated options\n\nA few options:\n\n1. Port `kubernetes-client/javascript` to the browser. Start with a fork and then contribute the work upstream when we're happy with our results.\n2. **Chosen option:** Wait for upstream to solve the problem. **In the meantime, use an** [**OpenAPI scaffold**](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) generated in a similar way to the [Kubernetes client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen/), i.e. using the [`typescript-fetch` generator](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen/blob/0ffb80637bf25586113914a58913c882b7ce8017/openapi/typescript-fetch.sh#L50) ([docs](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/typescript-fetch/)), or maybe even **just the** [**`javascript` generator**](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/javascript) but without a dependency on `node-fetch`.\n3. Wait for upstream to solve the problem. In the meantime, wrap the REST API calls we need on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn the long run, I think (1) is the best solution, but starting with (2) or (3) would get us results faster.\n\n### References\n\nI've prepared a [PoC project](https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason/k8s-js-experiments) for approach (2). This makes it possible to start building a real interactive web UI for Kubernetes without waiting for the KAS part to be finished.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-27T13:48:54.392Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T12:06:27.695Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T13:25:24.775Z","closed_by":{"id":9094263,"username":"anna_vovchenko","name":"Anna Vovchenko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9094263/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/anna_vovchenko"},"labels":["Deliverable","Track Health Status","devops::configure","feature::addition","frontend","group::configure","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":4088036,"username":"hfyngvason","name":"Hordur Freyr Yngvason","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4088036/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason"},{"id":9094263,"username":"anna_vovchenko","name":"Anna Vovchenko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9094263/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/anna_vovchenko"}],"author":{"id":4088036,"username":"hfyngvason","name":"Hordur Freyr Yngvason","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4088036/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4088036,"username":"hfyngvason","name":"Hordur Freyr Yngvason","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4088036/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/379111","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379111","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379111/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379111/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#379111","relative":"#379111","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#379111"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8038,"epic":{"id":519677,"iid":8038,"title":"Frontend access to Kubernetes API through KAS","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8038","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":117663625,"iid":379086,"project_id":278964,"title":"[MR Widget V2] Add info popover","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is very similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361562, except it's for the MR Widget V2.\n\nAdd an info popover with the text below.

schema","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps. They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nScan Result Policy Action currently supports individual approvers or a group of users. However, when a customer has projects with lower criticality or the scan results detect a vulnerability of low criticality (I.e., Low/Medium), they want to require an approver from the project based on the role (I.e., owner/maintainer)\n\nThis issue focusses on adding the `role_approvers` field to [security_orchestration_policy JSON schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ddce54835da0eb6f6c5748f9ebd19915281b9844/ee/app/validators/json_schemas/security_orchestration_policy.json)\n\n## Relevant links\n\nEpic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8018+\n\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\n- [ ] Documentation:\n- [ ] Feature flag:\n- [ ] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] ~backend Update [ee/app/validators/json_schemas/security_orchestration_policy.json](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ddce54835da0eb6f6c5748f9ebd19915281b9844/ee/app/validators/json_schemas/security_orchestration_policy.json) to add `role_approvers` schema:\n\n```json\n\"role_approvers\": {\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"description\": \"Specifies a list of roles required to approve affected merge request.\",\n  \"minItems\": 1,\n  \"additionalItems\": false,\n  \"items\":{\n    \"type\": {\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"guest\",\n        \"reporter\",\n        \"developer\",\n        \"maintainer\",\n        \"owner\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"minLength\": 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Verification steps\n\u003c!--\nAdd verification steps to help GitLab team members test the implementation. This is particularly useful\nduring the MR review and the ~\"workflow::verification\" step. You may not know exactly what the\nverification steps should be during issue refinement, so you can always come back later to add\nthem.\n\n1. Check-out the corresponding branch\n1. ...\n1.

To avoid a warning to users using DAST, the schema should be upgraded to 15.x.x before GitLab 15.8 is released.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- DAST should produce a Secure report version 15.x.x when running on GitLab 15.4 and above.\n- DAST should produce a Secure report version 14.x.x when running on GitLab 15.3 and below.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] DAST should read the `CI_SERVER_VERSION_MAJOR` and `CI_SERVER_VERSION_MINOR` CI/CD variables that are provided by GitLab\n- [ ] When MAJOR/MINOR version is `15.3` and below, DAST Python should produce a report that conforms to schema `14.1.2` (the same as it produces at time of writing)\n- [ ] When MAJOR/MINOR version is `15.3` and below, Browserker should produce a report that conforms to schema `14.1.2` (the same as it produces at time of writing)\n- [ ] When MAJOR/MINOR version is `15.4` and above, DAST Python should produce a report that conforms to schema `15.0.2`\n- [ ] When MAJOR/MINOR version is `15.4` and above, Browserker should produce a report that conforms to schema `15.0.2`\n- [ ] Configuration will likely need to be passed to Browserker to configure which version of the report it should conform to\n  - Alternatively, Browserker could read the `CI_SERVER_VERSION_XXX` CI/CD environment variables. If you take this approach, please don't use the CI/CD variable outside of the `config` package. This will ensure itC easy to introduce configuring Browserker using environment variables, which will be required when Browserker runs stand-alone from DAST Python\n- Changes to the 15.x.x schema involves:\n  - [ ] Remove `vulnerabilities[].cve`\n  - [ ] Remove `vulnerabilities[].scanner`\n  - [ ] Remove `vulnerabilities[].category`\n  - [ ] Remove `vulnerabilities[].discovered_at` (move it to `vulnerabilities[].details.discovered_at` if it's easy)\n  - [ ] Remove `vulnerabilities[].confidence`\n  - [ ] Remove `vulnerabilities[].message`\n  - [ ] Make sure `scan.start_time/end_time` conform to the new pattern\n- [ ] Test producing schemas in both format.

This happens in this sequence:\n\n- [`Projects::DestroyService#attempt_destroy`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/7d04cb83fadf7fc12693a80215fc6f06029d4481/app/services/projects/destroy_service.rb#L119)\n    - [`Projects::DestroyService#remove_registry_tags`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/7d04cb83fadf7fc12693a80215fc6f06029d4481/app/services/projects/destroy_service.rb#L256)\n        - [`Projects::ContainerRepository::DestroyService#execute`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/49ede537acdc58645e4451fe0eff8bac2f917e26/app/services/projects/container_repository/destroy_service.rb)\n            - [`ContainerRepository#delete_tags!`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/49ede537acdc58645e4451fe0eff8bac2f917e26/app/models/container_repository.rb#L480) OR `Projects::ContainerRepository::CleanupTagsService` (from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375604)\n\n\nIn `Projects::DestroyService#attempt_destroy`, if the registry data deletion yields a non-`true` value, we [raise an error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/7d04cb83fadf7fc12693a80215fc6f06029d4481/app/services/projects/destroy_service.rb#L120) to let the user know that the project deletion can't proceed. However, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375261 we found out that there are container repositories (and tags within) left behind on the registry for project paths that no longer exist on the Rails side. This means that somewhere in the execution path we may not be catching errors or failures when deleting the registry data and still proceed with the project deletion.\n\nOnce https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375604 is closed, we should take some time to investigate and try to reproduce this issue. It may be the case that the issue is no longer occurring, or that it was fixed by the changes from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375604, but it clearly happened at some point in time, so we must confirm.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-26T14:22:13.340Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T10:56:28.237Z","closed_at":"2022-12-09T15:27:37.001Z","closed_by":{"id":12695021,"username":"adie.po","name":"Adie Po","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12695021/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adie.po"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","Track Health Status","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","bug::functional","devops::package","group::container registry","needs investigation","rails","section::ops","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":12695021,"username":"adie.po","name":"Adie Po","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12695021/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adie.po"}],"author":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":12695021,"username":"adie.po","name":"Adie Po","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12695021/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adie.po"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/379021","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379021","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379021/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/379021/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#379021","relative":"#379021","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#379021"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9106,"epic":{"id":638114,"iid":9106,"title":"Container Registry: Storage usage bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9106","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":117623566,"iid":379019,"project_id":278964,"title":"Log navigation context when logging Chrome DevTools messages","description":"\n### Problem\n\nWhen diagnosing customer scans, DAST engineers are not able to trace errors back to the original source.

Looking at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html, I think it would help to have a decision tree or some criteria. For example, something along the lines: \"If you add a new ActiveRecord model that uses object storage or repository data, you need to add support for Geo replication. For example, a few years ago snippets used to be managed in the database alone. We later made it managed by a Git repository. If you're simply adding a model that only stores data in the database (e.g. `issues`), you do not need to do anything more.\"\n\n## Proposal\n\n(Mike proposed this but do whatever is clearest)\n\n- Add a doc section called e.g. `How to determine whether a new feature requires work to be supported by Geo` above https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo.html#steps-needed-to-replicate-a-new-data-type\n- Write introduction\n- Write a doc subsection e.g. `Git repositories` (a one-liner saying it needs to be added with [the SSF framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html))\n- Write a doc subsection e.g. `Files or blobs` (Mention that reusing Upload model gains Geo support for free, but this should not be done when large amount of data is expected.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_retry_job_fix \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_retry_job_fix \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_retry_job_fix true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_retry_job_fix --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_retry_job_fix`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `ci_retry_job_fix` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete ci_retry_job_fix --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_retry_job_fix false\n```\n\n\u003c!-- A feature flag can also be used for rolling out a bug fix or a maintenance work.\nIn this scenario, labels must be related to it, for example; ~\"type::feature\", ~\"type::bug\" or ~\"type::maintenance\".\nPlease use /copy_metadata to copy the labels from the issue you're rolling out.

Collaboration on this goal should happen entirely in this issue.\n\n## How to use this issue\n\n:warning: **The issue description is the SSoT for the current state of the schema and directory structure.** :warning:\n\nDiscussion should occur in comments and threads.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n* Each project can have multiple dashboards and each dashboard should be contained within its own directory. The root directory should be `.gitlab/product_analytics_dashboards`. Example:\n\n```\n.gitlab/product_analytics_dashboards\n├── conversion_funnels\n│   └── conversion_funnels.yaml\n├── demographic_breakdown\n│   └── demographic_breakdown.yaml\n├── north_star_metrics\n    └── north_star_metrics.yaml\n```\n\n* Only YAML files are supported.\n* The name of the directory should be a unique slug name of the dashboard. We can use that as the URL route.\n* Each dashboard folder should _at a minimum_ contain a dashboard definition file. The filename should match the folder name + `.yaml`.\n\n## Dashboard Definition Example\n\n```yaml\n---\nversion: '1'\ntitle: North Star Metrics\ndescription: North Star Metrics across all departments for the last 3 quarters.\n# Filters are applied to every widget\nfilters:\n  timeDimensions:\n    dateRange:\n      - '2016-01-01'\n      - '2016-01-30'\nwidgets:\n  - title: Overall Conversion Rate\n    gridAttributes:\n      yPos: 4\n      xPos: 1\n      width: 12\n      height: 2\n    visualization: CubeLineChart\n```\n\n## Visualization Definition Example\n\n```yaml\n---\nversion: '1'\ntype: LineChart\noptions:\n  xAxis\n    name: Time\n    type: time\n  yAxis: \n    name: Counts\ndata:\n  type: Cube\n  query:\n    measures:\n      - Stories.count\n    dimensions:\n      - Stories.category\n    filters:\n      - member: Stories.isDraft\n        operator: equals\n        values:\n          - 'No'\n    timeDimensions:\n      - dimension: Stories.time\n        # dateRange set by the dashboard filter\n        granularity: month\n    limit: 100\n    offset: 50\n    order:\n      Stories.time: asc\n      Stories.count: desc\n    timezone: America/Los_Angeles\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-25T08:38:22.722Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T12:20:43.820Z","closed_at":"2022-11-16T14:31:05.342Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["Category:Product Analytics","backend","devops::analytics","feature::addition","group::product analytics","section::analytics","spike","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":57,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-11-04","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378878","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/378878","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/378878/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/378878/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#378878","relative":"#378878","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#378878"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8574,"epic":{"id":582847,"iid":8574,"title":"Schema-driven customizable dashboards for Product Analytics","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8574","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":117511621,"iid":378868,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve Insights data loading error - Frontend","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen Insights loads data there might be query timeouts due to query volume.

Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 9355175115f3ffc13fe56aab0a9db0ca94316e6f`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217702) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217702) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217702) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `container_registry_delete_repository_with_cron_worker` feature flag.

Define DB schema for storing parent/child relation restrictions","description":"To be able to store restrictions for various types (and in future also allow user to customize these), these can not be hardcoded in model (as we have now for issue/task relationship), but we need to introduce a new model which allows storing these restrictions in DB.\n\nSchema should allow restrictions described in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8993 or existing hardcoded issue/task [restrictions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/work_items/parent_link.rb#L15-16) and should allow more customization in future.\n\nThis is related to how widget definitions mapping tables should look like (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374092), perhaps also blocked by the issue.\n\n\n### Proposal (taken from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378799#note_1149402175)\n\nThis is related to relations between work items in general. Because there can be different restrictions for different types of relations (parent/child restrictions in hierarchy widget may differ from restrictions in \"related work items\" widget), I think it makes sense to keep also restriction definitions separate. So proposal below focuses on parent/child restrictions only assuming that other relation types would be defined separately.\n\nAnother option would be to define one generic \"relation\" scheme which would attempt to keep restrictions for all possible relations between work items, but a major downside is that this would lead to having everything stored together which means also wider table (unless we would store data as JSONB).\n\nTo sum known use-cases listed in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8993 and existing restrictions for issue/type:\n\n* Tasks are children of Issues (row id 0 in table below)\n* Objectives can be nested on each other 9 levels deep (row id 1 in table below)\n* Key Results are children of Objectives (row id 2 in table below)\n* Issues are children of Issues (row id 3 in table below)\n\nAssuming there are following records in work_item_types table (this assumes this table looks like proposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374092):\n\n| id | name | namespace_id| disabled |\n| ------ | ------ |-------| -------- |\n| 0      | issue  | | | \n| 1      | task   | | |\n| 2      | requirement | | |\n| 3      | objective  | | | \n| 4      | key result   | | |\n| 5      | custom type 1 | 1 | |\n| 6      | custom type 2 | 1 | |\n| 7      | epic | | |\n\nA possible solution would be storing these in the following table and allow override approach similar to overrides proposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374092. table might be called e.g. `work_item_hierarchy_restrictions`:\n\n| id | namespace_id | disabled | parent_type_id | child_type_id | maximum_depth |\n| -- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- |\n| 0  |              | false    | 0         | 1        | 1 |\n| 1  |              | false    | 3         | 3        | 9 |\n| 2  |              | false    | 3         | 4        | 1 |\n| 3  |              | false    | 0         | 0        | 1 |\n| 4  |  1           | true     | 0         | 0        | 1 |\n| 5  |  1           | false    | 3         | 3        | 4 |\n| 6  |              | false    | 7         | 0        | 1 |\n| 7  |              | false    | 7         | 7        | 7 |\n\n* only restrictions listed in table are allowed\n* parent_type_id/child_type_id are foreign keys referencing work_item_types.id (so the benefit of this approach is we keep referential integrity)\n* maximum_depth defines how many relations of this type can be stacked on each other (perhaps makes sense only if parent_type_id==child_type_id)\n* independently on max_depth we should still keep hardcoded maximum depth limit for the whole tree (e.g. 10) to make sure users can't define too deep trees which would cause performance issues\n* once custom types are allowed, also user-defined restrictions for custom types can be added in the same way (as parent_type_id and child_type_id just references work_item_type.id)\n* there are also other restrictions for issue/task: whether both are in the same project and if child is confidential for confidential parent - I can imagine these could be made configurable in future too, but perhaps can be left hardcoded for now for all types?\n* similar to above, it's possible that other hierarchy restrictions settings will be needed in future which would need additional fields, but perhaps we can add them when needed\n* records with IDs 6 and 7 demonstrate epic\u003c-\u003eissue relationship: issue can be child of an epic, epic can be child of other epic (with max depth of 7)\n\n### Future customizations\n\n* this table is prefilled with default set of restrictions (having namespace_id nil)\n* when we allow custom restrictions/custom types, users can add namespaced restrictions (with namespace_id set) which will override same default restriction. Same restriction is a record with same parent_type_id and child_id\n* any overrides of default types will be allowed only in root namespaces (and these overrides will be inherited in the whole group hierarchy), note that this might be re-considered in future (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378799#note_1159052478)\n* the default value can be either customized (e.g. row id 5 in table above - it tells that nested level of objectives is 4 levels max and number of children for one objective is 10) or disabled (row id 4 - disables restriction which allows that issue can be parents of other issues)\n\nPotential risks:\n* it's a bit more complicated to get \"valid\" set of restrictions (as namespaced rules override default rules), but I think this is not too big issue as this can be handled on Rails side in worst case.\n* we could use this concept to predifne different sets of restrictions (but allow only one set of restrictions), then users could switch to different set (e.g. by default we would allow Epic-\u003eIssue-\u003eTask hiearchies, but user could choose to use rather Feature-\u003eIssue only). If there would be too many overrides of default settings, then `work_item_hierarchy_restrictions` might grow noticeably. But I tend to think this should scale sufficiently for now.\n\nOther options:\n* use restrictions per each work item type in JSONB format - a downside is that we loose referential integrity (and it means also additional logic to assure integrity of referenced types)\n\n@mcelicalderonG @digitalmoksha @acroitor @gitlab-org/plan-stage/backend-engineers WDYT?","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-24T11:32:01.923Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T15:19:12.921Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T07:35:40.878Z","closed_by":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"labels":["Track Health Status","Unplanned","backend","devops::plan","group::product planning","missed:15.6","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":56,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378799","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/378799","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/378799/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/378799/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#378799","relative":"#378799","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#378799"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9434,"epic":{"id":676068,"iid":9434,"title":"Work Items - Relationship validation and restrictions","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9434","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":117445273,"iid":378764,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move config for status filter","description":"The goal is to break the connection with `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/helpers.js`, move the filter configurations into the filter component.

now)\n- [x] `ee/app/services/security/findings/dismiss_service.rb`\n- [x] `ee/app/services/security/ingestion/tasks/ingest_vulnerabilities/create.rb`

experience in order to use it and provide feedback (feedback mechanism may be a separate issue). \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [All](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/)\n\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Add a **Toggle switch** in User Profile Menu - see Design Management\n- Toggle opts-in to the **Navigation Alpha** (non-supported and will be broken)\n- Once feature-complete, we begin **Navigation Beta** (non-supported and beta testing). \n   - For some, the toggle will be disabled, they will receive the **Current** OR **Beta navigation** UI and participate in tests.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [ ] Add page in GitLab Docs for switching to North Star opt-in @rdickenson \n   - [ ] Note that if beta's are running it may not be available\n\n### Data\n\n- [ ] Determine how we'll track clicks in both states (Old nav vs North Star) @mikegreiling @thutterer \n- [x] Determine how we can query for all users who have this setting turned on @thutterer  \n\n  ```\n  UserPreference.where(use_new_navigation: true).count\n  ```\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- We can detect who has the opt-in switched on in the data\n- We can seamlessly switch between both states and are able to have the events update accordingly\n\n## Implementation

Problem\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363863, we fixed a ~security vulnerability where the [group IP enforcement](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/access_and_permissions.html#restrict-group-access-by-ip-address) was not properly respected by the Package Registry.\n\n(A) The fix used there was quite simple: if there is an IP enforcement violation, then we simply remove _all_ package registry permissions. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/8287b24dca55519deec457aea4b25846463b0e98/ee/app/policies/ee/project_policy.rb#L423 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/8287b24dca55519deec457aea4b25846463b0e98/ee/app/policies/ee/group_policy.rb#L415.\n\n(B) On the other hand, we have a community effort around this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329253). Among the changes, we needed to put more conditions on how `read_package` is evaluated and granted by policies. Because of this [rule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2d2f0bcb347a44cbe56fb579a101bf967f3f534a/app/policies/project_policy.rb#L636), we were forced there to [create](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/90963) package dedicated policies for [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2d2f0bcb347a44cbe56fb579a101bf967f3f534a/app/policies/packages/policies/project_policy.rb) and [group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2d2f0bcb347a44cbe56fb579a101bf967f3f534a/app/policies/packages/policies/group_policy.rb). These policies are super simple: for `read_package` use my rules, for everything else, use the project/group policy.\n\n(A) was deployed in %\"15.3\" and (B) in %\"15.4\".\n\nNow guess what happens when (A) and (B) are together? Yeah, :boom: \n\nGroup IP enforcement is again not respected from %\"15.4\" for the `read_package` permission which is the one permission used when pulling packages. \n\nIn few words: this is a security issue regression.\n\n## :fire_engine: Solution\n\n* Update the package dedicated policies to properly deny `read_package` if a group ip violation is detected.\n   * Defense in depth: go further and simply deny all `*_package` permissions.\n   * :warning: the project policy was updated for %\"15.6\" in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/100260.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status f8cc9e78f289089908fc6811f42e6784eba34930`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [-] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_partitioning_use_ci_builds_metadata_routing_table \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_partitioning_use_ci_builds_metadata_routing_table true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `ci_partitioning_use_ci_builds_metadata_routing_table` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_partitioning_use_ci_builds_metadata_routing_table --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_partitioning_use_ci_builds_metadata_routing_table false\n```\n\n\u003c!-- A feature flag can also be used for rolling out a bug fix or a maintenance work.\nIn this scenario, labels must be related to it, for example; ~\"type::feature\", ~\"type::bug\" or ~\"type::maintenance\".\nPlease use /copy_metadata to copy the labels from the issue you're rolling out.

This task is to review those in the [spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gweXRsv0MdMXMyejuWpmGmp2T123geq2rlsJrdDh8r0/edit#gid=0) and take the following corrective action\n-  If the status has been reviewed with `Action required` `Y`, notes indicate the action to take. We will want to do a check on each gem, and if it has reasonable unit tests available, then setup Ruby 3 to run those specs with Ruby 3. If they pass, that provides us first layer of confidence. Once this is done, the `Action required` can be set to `N`\n- If the unit tests don't exist, or are are very basic, please file an issue to add UT to the gem or if we can remove/replace it.

changer. In this release, we now have the ability to filter issues and work items using a `not` [issue list filter](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#filter-the-list-of-issues) for Health Status.
