DB modifications in Ci::Build within state transitions","description":"## What is a cross-database modification\n\nCross-database modification happens when data is modified in two different databases within an open transaction. This can cause reliability issues later when the CI database tables are moved to a separate database server. \n\nExample: keeping transaction open to wait for a 3rd party call (UPDATE query in a different DB) which cannot be rolled back anyway.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe `Ci::Build` model implements a state machine where various state transitions alter the associated deployment record. \n\n### Offenses\n\nThe Offenses have been ignored with the `.allow_cross_database_modification_within_transaction` method. You can find them by grepping for the method name and the issue number:\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"allow_cross_database_modification_within_transaction.*338867\" app/models/ci/build.rb\n```\n\nSee an example here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/build.rb#L333\n\nYou can remove the `allow_cross_database_modification_within_transaction` block and run the test cases to see the actual failure messages. (`rspec spec/models/ci/build_spec.rb`)\n\nOnce the offenses have been fixed the `allow_cross_database_modification_within_transaction` method calls can be removed and this issue can be closed.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe `deployments` table will stay in the Main database so the update statements need to be moved out of the state machine's transaction. \n\nOptions:\n\n- Use the `build.run_after_commit` block.\n- Use an async job to make the record updates.\n\nBoth options are less \"safe\". We're not going to have the same consistency guarantee as to the version with the transaction so we need to find the best way forward.

[x] Remove the foreign keys from the build info tables to the `ci_pipelines` table\n   * For future quick reference, the foreign keys are defined:\n   ```sql\n     ALTER TABLE ONLY packages_build_infos\n         ADD CONSTRAINT fk_rails_17a9a0dffc FOREIGN KEY (pipeline_id) REFERENCES ci_pipelines(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;\n   ```\n   ```sql\n     ALTER TABLE ONLY packages_package_file_build_infos\n         ADD CONSTRAINT fk_rails_3e3f630188 FOREIGN KEY (pipeline_id) REFERENCES ci_pipelines(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;\n   ```\n1. [x] When a pipeline is deleted a the pipeline id in the build infos table is \"nullified\" (that's the `ON DELETE SET NULL` part on the FKs above). \n   * To have that behavior back, we will need two `has_many X, dependent: :nullify` in the `Ci::Pipeline` model. Why two? because we have two build infos objects: one at the package level and one at the package file level.\n1. [x] remove the `has_many :pipelines, through: :build_infos` statement.\n   * Replace it with a custom function that will break the join query in two:\n      ```ruby\n         def pipelines\n           Ci::Pipeline.id_in(build_infos.pluck(:pipeline_id))\n         end\n      ```\n    * Investigate a bit if we really need to return *all* pipelines or if the [first one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1ad294be8b96c45060aa6097375b78b33fce8018/app/models/packages/package.rb#L254-266) is enough.\n    * Alternative (from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338660): we can ask rails to disable the join query when dealing with a `has_X through:` association (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67834#note_647234358).

Pending response.\n1. Received response, which indicated [pass](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329636#note_654394212).\n\nIn other words, there was no way to indicate failure.  This was done for the [sake of simplicity/iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327634#note_563430395).  API clients, as well as the API itself, assume that every request from the client represents `passed`.\n\nA failure state was implemented later, under https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329636.  For the sake of backward compatibility with existing API clients, the status parameter had a default of `passed`.\n\n## Problem to solve\n\nFor the External Status Checks API, a default status of `passed` basically means, \"when in doubt, assume the MR can proceed\".

How do issues flow in the hierarchy? Is an issue created at a group level visible in child groups/projects or does it only flow up the hierarchy?\n\nA final decision has not been reached yet, but If we had to make one today, it would work like this:\n\n1. Worked items flow up a hierarchy just like Issues and Epics do today. In the future, we will figure out the ideal solution for rolling them [horizontally across one or more `Namespaces`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296668).\n1. A child `Namespaces` can assign issues to parent work items (and in parent groups) that are non-confidential. \n1. If a work item is marked as `Confidential`, it will follow the same permissions rules are Issues and Epics currently follow in terms of visibility.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-18T16:04:53.909Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T17:42:10.630Z","closed_at":"2022-07-16T22:20:04.072Z","closed_by":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"labels":["UX","auto updated","backend","devops::plan","group::project management","missed:15.1","namespace","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"}],"author":{"id":5709669,"username":"mushakov","name":"Melissa Ushakov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5709669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mushakov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"user_notes_count":30,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338819","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338819","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338819/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338819/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338819","relative":"#338819","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338819"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8308,"epic":{"id":555233,"iid":8308,"title":"Add support for work items natively within Groups","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8308","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92202952,"iid":338806,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move rubocop in its own job in Version-App","description":"The following discussion from [!605](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-services/version-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/605#note_654028735) should be addressed:\n\n@a_akgun discussion:\n\n\u003e 1.

a reusable vulnerability report component","description":"Currently, the vulnerability report is hard-coded to only handle the `project`, `group`, `instance`, and `pipeline` findings. We have upcoming work to show the vulnerability report in a number of new places, and it's becoming impractical to hard-code in every new type. We should rework the vulnerability report so that it's reusable and flexible. In general, we need the following:\n\n1. Support for different filters that can be passed in:\n\n```vue\n\u003cvulnerability-report\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate #filters\u003e\n    \u003c!-- your custom filters here --\u003e\n```\n\n2. Support custom header and footer content:\n\n```vue\n\u003cvulnerability-report\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate #header\u003e\n    \u003c!-- your custom header here --\u003e\n  \u003c/template\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate #footer\u003e\n    \u003c!-- your custom footer here --\u003e\n  \u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\n3. Support passing in vulnerability data:\n\n```vue\n\u003cvulnerability-report :vulnerabilities=\"vulnerabilities\"\u003e\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- [ ] Create a new `vulnerability_report.vue` component that's reusable. The current one does something like this:\n\n```vue\n\u003cvulnerability-report\u003e\n  \u003cfilters /\u003e\n  \u003cgroup-vulnerabilities v-if=\"isGroup\" :filters=\"filters\" /\u003e\n  \u003cinstance-vulnerabilities v-else-if=\"isInstance\" :filters=\"filters\" /\u003e\n  \u003cproject-vulnerabilities v-else-if=\"isProject\" :filters=\"filters\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpipeline-findings v-else-if=\"isPipeline\" :filters=\"filters\" /\u003e\n\u003c/vulnerability-report\u003e\n```\n\nbut this isn't very flexible because to add a new report type, we need to create a new component and add it to the `if`/`else` list. Thew new component should be used by the `\u003cxyz-vulnerabilities\u003e` components so that it's something like this instead:\n\n```vue\n\u003cgroup-vulnerabilities\u003e\n  \u003cvulnerability-report :vulnerabilities=\"vulnerabilities\"\u003e\n    \u003ctemplate #filters\u003e...\u003c/template\u003e\n  \u003c/vulnerability-report\u003e\n\u003c/group-vulnerabilities\u003e\n```\n\n- [ ] Add template slots for header, footer, and filter content to `vulnerability_report.vue`:\n\n```vue\n\u003cvulnerability-report\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate #filters\u003e\u003c/template\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate #header\u003e\u003c/template\u003e\n  \u003ctemplate #footer\u003e\u003c/template\u003e\n\u003c/vulnerability-report\u003e\n```\n\n- [ ] Remove `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/shared/vulnerability_report_layout.vue` and combine it into `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/shared/vulnerability_report.vue`. At one point there was a good reason to have a separate layout component, but nowadays it's only used to make the filters sticky, which we can do directly inside `vulnerability_report.vue` instead of needing a separate component for it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-18T10:39:09.397Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T07:03:21.399Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T20:53:36.525Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Deliverable","devops::secure","frontend","group::threat insights","missed:14.4","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"}],"author":{"id":4907528,"username":"dftian","name":"Daniel Tian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d7186a64c42708833291afd7749c7b5?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dftian"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338790","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338790","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338790/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338790/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338790","relative":"#338790","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338790"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6345,"epic":{"id":307314,"iid":6345,"title":"Cluster Image Scanning: Vulnerability Report Tab","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6345","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92176027,"iid":338782,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate Pull Mirroring improvements","description":"Pull Mirroring is built over Import / Export and it may be time to reconsider the current architecture.\n\nThis issue is a investigation to determine what improvements could be made to Pull Mirroring to improve:\n\n- performance\n- resilience\n- observability\n\nIt would also be useful to understand if Pull Mirroring is contributing to the [Source Code error budget spend](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6298).\n\nThe scope of this issue is to determine what could be done to help achieve these goals, including adding observability, tuning, code splitting or a complete rewrite.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [x] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e `zentao_issues_integration` true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set `zentao_issues_integration` \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set `zentao_issues_integration` \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set `zentao_issues_integration` true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup ``zentao_issues_integration``\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove ``zentao_issues_integration`` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] (Note because the feature flag name is the same as a licensed feature, I believe instead of the commands below, instead we will need someone with write access to staging and production to run: `Feature.remove(:zentao_issues_integration)`\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature delete `zentao_issues_integration` --dev`\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature delete `zentao_issues_integration` --staging`\n    - [-] `/chatops run feature delete `zentao_issues_integration``\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\nBecause the feature flag name is the same as a licensed feature, we need to ask someone with write access to production (like a SRE) to run `Feature.disable(:zentao_issues_integration)`","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-18T07:13:32.929Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:35:34.381Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T00:11:05.592Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"labels":["Integration::ZenTao","devops::manage","feature flag","group::integrations","section::dev","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":2556296,"username":"icbd","name":"Baodong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2556296/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/icbd"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338775","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":44,"completed_count":28},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"28 of 44 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338775","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338775/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338775/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338775","relative":"#338775","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338775"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92155596,"iid":338766,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove use of `Gitlab::Utils::Override` from TrialRegistrationsController","description":"The following discussion from !67072 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @krasio started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67072#note_652405257):  (+3 comments)\n\n    \u003e I am surprised we have to use `Gitlab::Utils::Override` here, isn't this a case of ordinary Ruby inheritance (`TrialRegistrationsController \u003c RegistrationsController`)?

But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

The modified tokens include a special `migration_eligible` flag which will tell the registry whether a new container repository should be migrated or not. It's important to note that this flag does not represent a new claim/grant or any kind of authorization, it's just used to communicate the value of a feature flag to the registry.\n\nThis logic continues to sit behind a feature flag introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63907.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe code we changed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63907 is for external use only, it is not used internally for the GitLab Rails API/UI. If an external client (e.g. Docker) is requesting a token (through the `/jwt/auth` endpoint), the migration eligibility flag will be added to the token, if applicable ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a338088bb397312a607d5cbcea5fc0234b6ab3ff/app/services/auth/container_registry_authentication_service.rb#L99)). However, for internal use, such as for listing tags through the Rails API or the UI, we are using a different code path to generate these tokens ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a338088bb397312a607d5cbcea5fc0234b6ab3ff/app/services/auth/container_registry_authentication_service.rb#L39)), and that code path hasn't been updated to inject the migration eligibility flag.\n\nTherefore, as consequence, when in migration mode, listing or deleting tags through the Rails API/UI may fail because the token does not include the flag and therefore the registry is unable to process the requests in the correct way.\n\n## Solution\n\nModify the internal function used to generate tokens for internal use so that they include the migration eligibility flag.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-16T14:48:37.288Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T09:00:56.425Z","closed_at":"2021-08-19T08:29:40.049Z","closed_by":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João

This implies spending more time and effort triaging the report.\n\nA possible solution would be ignoring these vulnerabilities, but that would be an extremely bad idea because we would miss the update when the fix actually comes out.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\nTrivy, the standard container scanner utility being used by GitLab's container scanning, already provides a `--ignore-unfixed` CLI switch that enables the desired behaviour.\n\nGitLab only needs to somehow allow the use of the flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] ~backend Extend `scan_command` method in `lib/gcs/trivy.rb` to support adding `--ignore-unfixed` when `CS_IGNORE_UNFIXED` variable is set to `true` (default: `false`),\n- [x] ~backend Extend `scan_command` method in `lib/gcs/grype.rb` to support adding `--only-fixed` when `CS_IGNORE_UNFIXED` variable is set to `true` (default: `false`),\n- [x] ~backend Add new method `ignore_unfixed_vulnerabilities?` in `lib/gcs/environment.rb` to encapsulate fetching `CS_IGNORE_UNFIXED` variable (default: `false`),","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-16T08:55:21.912Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T03:20:45.775Z","closed_at":"2022-02-03T16:15:19.144Z","closed_by":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","automation:ml","backend","customer","devops::govern","feature::enhancement","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"}],"author":{"id":7004017,"username":"pmfa","name":"Paulo Albuquerque","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7004017/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pmfa"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338554","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":9,"completed_count":3},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 9 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338554","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338554/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338554/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338554","relative":"#338554","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338554"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6846,"epic":{"id":360889,"iid":6846,"title":"Identify if a finding is fixable","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6846","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92016267,"iid":338549,"project_id":278964,"title":"Version App - Update supported Ruby version 3.0","description":"We started to work on getting our code in line to work with Ruby 3.0 for GitLab app. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5149\n\nI would say we could start working to do the same with Version App.\n\n\n\n## Deploy plan\n\n1.

`keep_historical_vulnerability_statistics_always_consistent`\n\nAs discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68124#note_650750189, this code is not necessary and should be removed.\n\nIn this instance, a feature flag is being used to remove a feature, rather than add it. We're doing this so we can confirm that there will be no unforeseen impact to the removal of the updates.\n\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: @gitlab-org/secure/threat-insights-backend-team \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_secure_threat_insights`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @minac \n- PM: @matt_wilson \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n1.

Any MRs that need to be rolled back? Communication that needs to happen? What are some things you can think of that could go wrong - data loss or broken pages? --\u003e\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nObserve familiar security over the next 1-2 weeks.\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\nAs per roll-out plan.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

With integration of the runner into the scan engine, it's information logs are only sent to the scanner log, and no longer displayed to the console.\n\nTo display this output from worker-entry, the scanner will need a new operation to return the needed data. Next the python library will need a new method added, and finally the worker-entry will need to be updated to display this output.\n\nExample of useful output from runner:\n\n```\nLoaded 2 operations from: assets/openapi-v3-1-json/openapi.v3.1.0.json\nTesting operation: 'GET /api/users'\nFinished testing operation 'GET /api/users' performed 31 requests.\nTesting operation: 'POST /api/users'\nFinished testing operation 'POST /api/users' performed 61 requests.\nFinished testing. Performed a total of 92 requests.\n```\n\n### Part 1: Add a status operation to `RunnerController`\n\nCreate an operation for the status of a static testing job. This operation will be called by the `worker-entry` component to determine if the job has completed, and the current set of operations that have been tested.\n\nController: `RunnerController`\nOperation: `GET /api/runner/JOB_ID`\nReturn: json, 200 OK\n\nWhen `end_time` is `null` if the operation is still being tested.\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"job.status\", (Finished|Error|Idle|etc)\n  \"operation_count\": 0,\n  \"fault_count\": 0,\n  \"completed_operations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"operation.Name\",\n      \"total_requests\": 10\n      \"start_time\": \"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z\",\n      \"end_time\": \"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Part 2: Add a new method to python library to call new operation\n\nAdd a new method to the python library that calls the newly added operation.\n\n### Part 3: Update worker-entry to display information to the user\n\nThe worker-entry has been refactored and no longer uses the generic ci component. The best place to add this new output is in `WorkerEntry.wait_for_finish()`. This method has a loop that runs every 30 seconds or so that can call the operation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-13T19:59:53.558Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:53:45.457Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T14:31:09.472Z","closed_by":{"id":7488329,"username":"herbmadrigal","name":"Herber Madrigal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7488329/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/herbmadrigal"},"labels":["Category:DAST","GitLab Ultimate","auto updated","backend","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":7488329,"username":"herbmadrigal","name":"Herber Madrigal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7488329/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/herbmadrigal"}],"author":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael Eddington","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6121997/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikeeddington"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7488329,"username":"herbmadrigal","name":"Herber Madrigal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7488329/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/herbmadrigal"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338498","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338498","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338498/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338498/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338498","relative":"#338498","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338498"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6502,"epic":{"id":317541,"iid":6502,"title":"API Security scanner speed improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6502","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91956239,"iid":338497,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add request/response size to GitLab-Shell","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

Summary\n\nWe should not add to service ping metrics that are marked as removed in their YAML definition.\n\nFilter the metric definition to not select `removed` metrics.\n\n# Details\n\nWe compute

The upside is that then we can set `querystringId: 'tool'` and it will match the filter name, but the downside is that because the querystring key is changed, it will break any existing bookmarks.

concept and see if it's viable","description":"### Problem \n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336022, we started digging into the problem of access to specific features in GitLab, specifically within the context of incident/vulnerability management. \n\nRight now, access to features is tied to `role`. If you're a `Developer`, you can see specific features, and perform certain actions. `Maintainers` have a higher level of access, and a greater number of actions available to them. Feature permissions are then tied to those pre-defined roles. So, for example, only `Developers+` can change the status of an alert. Only `Maintainers` can create an on-call schedule. \n\nBut, what if you only want _some_ `Developers` to have access to certain features, and have those features be read-only for others? Or, what if you want a group of people to have a `Maintainer` role for some features _only_, while keeping their role for other features unchanged? \n\nHow can we allow for this kind of access granularity given the current roles we have within GitLab?\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor)\n--\u003e\nWe started discussing this problem in Monitor and Secure, because it impacts the Incident Management and Vulnerability Management feature sets. But, this idea could certainly impact many teams, and apply across multiple persona groups.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nStepping towards more granular, user-defined feature-access within Gitlab.\n\n### WIP Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nWhile it might be nice to introduce a fully flexible way for people to [define permissions by role](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/62f9b74a692093a59027fcc1c736d242/Permissions_by_role.png) or [by feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/bd298c43ae5467b77fed4a4a43081083/Edit_feature_access.png), introducing that concept within GitLab would likely require a very large re-working of our current model for handling roles/permissions.\n\nWith that in mind, we're exploring more of a MVC way of tying access to specific features to targeted groups of users, called `Teams`. That could look like this:\n\n| Team page | Editing team members | Adding new team members |\n|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n|![Access_by_team](/uploads/cf516f6a496b3ff38523ca5fb36945cc/Access_by_team.png) | ![Edit_team](/uploads/4368139cf7fc918dc222e803f6fc0401/Edit_team.png) | ![Add_team_member](/uploads/f8ed98c35fada9c0b4ca48202835da3d/Add_team_member.png) |\n\nFor the MVC:\n\n* We would introduce the concept of teams. People can add members to these pre-defined teams. Team members would have the ability to interact at a pre-defined role level with a designated feature set. (For example, the incident responders team would have a default role of `Developer` and they would have that role for the incident management features *only*).\n* We would also introduce the ability to restrict access to those features to that team *only* (ie, everyone who isn't a team member would have read-only access to those features *only*).\n* The \"Teams\" would initially be defined by us, not by the users. That would allow us to tie the teams to specific feature sets more easily for a first pass. In the future, we could allow people to create their own teams, and tie those teams to specific features.\n* The role level assigned to team members would also not be editable for the first pass. But, in future, we could allow those roles to be editable, as well. (Which could, perhaps, look like [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/732f0f91e6bf57b1cfb8c17ef0c023bb/Edit_team.png).)\n* The functionality would live at the group level, and would cascade down to all projects within the group.\n\n### Goals for this issue\n\nWe've come up with this idea for teams. We need to dig into the idea a bit more to see if it's something worth pursuing. Here are a few questions worth exploring:\n- How do we evaluate the idea to see if it's a good fit? \n- Is it technically feasible? \n- Does it solve the problems we need it to in the short-term? \n- Is this idea flexible enough to expand in the ways we need it to expand down the line?\n\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe had initially proposed the `teams` idea as a way to start stepping towards more granular permissions without having to build out role based access control in GitLab. As discussion in this issue progressed however, we realized that, in order to have the granularity of control we'll likely need in terms of allowing/limiting access to specific features, we probably *will* need go the RBAC route.\n\nTo future investigate RBAC in GitLab, we've created a [design pod](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339285). Designers in Monitor, Secure and Manage will work together to outline what RBAC could look like in GitLab. As part of this effort, we'll do some competitive analysis, and come up with some initial concepts that we can start sharing with everyone more broadly, and that we can start testing with users.\n\nWe'll ensure that the plans we come up with align with the move towards Namespaces/Workspaces, and with the consolidation of projects and groups, efforts that are otherwise already in progress. It's possible that the teams idea might be useful for differentiating the different kinds of groups available in GitLab (groups of projects and groups of people). But, as that's a separate issue from the access control we need more immediately in Monitor and Secure, we'll focus on that first, by working to define what RBAC would look like in GitLab.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-12T22:13:28.157Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T19:39:50.898Z","closed_at":"2021-09-10T21:57:50.374Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["UX","customer","devops::monitor","group::respond","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":65,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338379","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":7,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338379","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338379/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338379/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338379","relative":"#338379","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338379"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7420,"epic":{"id":425732,"iid":7420,"title":"[PILOT] Discuss Design Pod for RBAC UX","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7420","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91890094,"iid":338357,"project_id":278964,"title":"Pipelines without artifacts show a blank dropdown on pipelines table page","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\nOn the pipelines table page, each pipeline has a column with a dropdown for artifacts.

Scanning analyzer to security-products namespace","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps. They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nWe need to update the Cluster Image Scanning analyzer to publish its images in `registry.gitlab.com/security-products/cluster-image-scanning` _instead of_ `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/cluster-image-scanning`. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297525 (confidential) for rationale. \n\n\u003c!--\nA brief explanation of the why, not the what or how. Assume the reader doesn't know the\nbackground and won't have time to dig-up information from comment threads.\n--\u003e\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- [Location of Container Images](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure/release_process.html#location-of-container-images)\n\u003c!--\nInformation that the developer might need to refer to when implementing the issue.\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e)\n  - [Design 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n  - [Design 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n- [Similar implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/\u003cid\u003e)\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1. [x] Create https://gitlab.com/security-products/cluster-image-scanning\n1. [x] ~backend Update [ci-templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/26ebf9822b2d0ee9fc55fff6f23ac5b40a338493/includes-dev/analyzer.yml#L133) to allow the image name to be configured via a variable.\n\n   e.g.\n   ```yaml\n   variables:\n     ANALYZER_IMAGE_NAME: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE\n\n   # in .docker_tag job\n   - export TARGET_IMAGE=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:${IMAGE_TAG:-$CI_JOB_NAME}\n   ```\n\n1. [x] ~backend Set variable in [cluster-image-scanning .gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/cluster-image-scanning/-/blob/a2d39aba8acd2738aa3836fe9f19464a092ddb76/.gitlab-ci.yml) to begin publishing images to new location.\n1. [x] ~backend Mirror [the existing versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/cluster-image-scanning/container_registry/2070027) to the new registry (pull and then push)\n1. [x] ~backend Change the default `CIS_ANALYZER_IMAGE` in [Cluster-Image-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b011b9db401ee77f2bfe8b056c35ac7f30fdb42c/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Cluster-Image-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml) to point to the new registry location\n\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated. The plan can also\ncall-out responsibilities for other team members or teams.\n\ne.g.:\n\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 1\n  - [ ] `@person` Step 1a\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 2\n\n--\u003e\n\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n# ~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\nOther settings you might want to include when creating the issue.\n\n# /assign @\n# /epic
