This has a configurable maximum capacity which defaults to 25; in close-to-ideal conditions, this allows us to backfill projects at a rate of ~3,000 / hr or 2.5TB/day.\n\nTo increase our rate of sync, we should have additional parallelism by spinning up one scheduler *per shard*. We can reduce the default max_capacity when we do this.\n\nWith Gitaly's `fetch_remote` feature turned on, the effect of this will be to have the contents of each repository be streamed directly from the Gitaly server for each shard on the primary, to the Gitaly server for each shard on the secondary. This should allow us to perform more syncs in parallel, without overloading the primary in the process (if max_capacity is 1, for instance, and we have 10 shards, this would ensure that we proceed with a net parallelism of 10, but no shard will ever be performing more than one backfill job at a time).\n\n---\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues/2381, there is some data that suggests that Geo might actually be able to issue a `git clone` on every project in GitLab.com. This is similar to the project mirror case where we need to schedule lots of updates for many projects, but it's a bit trickier because we want to clone all of GitLab.com as fast as possible, not just 24,000 projects from external sources.\n\nTo do this, we want the following properties:\n\n1. We should be able to add worker machines to increase the rate of clones on the client side\n2. We want to avoid duplicated work (e.g. only issue a `git pull` once if there is an update)\n3. We want to avoid killing GitLab.com\n\nHere some ideas on what we might want to do:\n\n- [ ] Separate the cloning into a separate Sidekiq queue (e.g. `geo_repository_clone`)\n- [ ] Measure the rate at which we are consuming the Sidekiq queue\n- [ ] Have an adaptive algorithm like TCP that starts slow with a certain target rate, doubles the rate if it is being achieved, and then backs off as the rate decreases.\n\nThoughts?\n\n/cc: @pcarranza, @jarv, @dbalexandre, @to1ne, @brodock","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-08-11T06:48:40.848Z","updated_at":"2020-06-15T16:31:18.415Z","closed_at":"2017-12-07T16:09:40.895Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","bug::performance","devops::systems","group::geo","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":360827,"iid":3,"group_id":9970,"title":"10.3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-08-16T16:51:52.890Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T16:15:37.036Z","due_date":"2017-12-22","start_date":"2017-11-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"}],"author":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3147","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3147","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3147/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3147/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3147","relative":"#3147","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#3147"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24655902,"iid":19077,"project_id":278964,"title":"Visibility level restrictions apply to admins when forking a project","description":"### Summary\n\nIn the settings, under \"Visibility and Access Controls\", where you can set visibility level restrictions, there is some text that says:\n\u003e  Selected levels cannot be used by non-admin users for projects or snippets.

handling of stuck mirrors","description":"Extracted from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3021#note_36460320\n\nWe treat any mirror that spends more than 20 minutes on the Sidekiq queue (`scheduled`) as stuck, mark it as failed and set it to be executed again ASAP, even if the job is still on the queue and just a little delayed, which can happen all the time depending on load, or when we deploy and pause Sidekiq. This cleaning up of \"stuck\" mirrors can happen multiple times if we're hitting anything below 150 mirror workers per 20 minutes, resulting in potentially hundreds of projects being marked as failed while their workers are still on the queue. These \"stuck\" workers get their next execution timestamp set to \"right now\", which means they skip the line and will be rescheduled ahead of any mirrors that were already in the queue, blocking them from running. Since the workers are still on the queue and don't check if their mirror is still in the `scheduled` state when they run, all of them happily update their project, which of course results in even _longer_ delays, and even more projects getting marked as failed and skipping the line, exacerbating the problem... Earlier today we had 19696 mirrors that had their `import_error` set to `The mirror update took too long to complete.`, out of about 24k, which means that they at one point were marked as \"stuck\". If we _hadn't_ marked these mirrors that were still on the queue as failed, the Sidekiq queue wouldn't have grown beyond 150, these mirrors would still eventually have ran, and so would the projects that were in line behind them.\n\nWe should:\n\n- [x] Detect stuck mirrors using the same mechanism we use to detect stuck initial imports, which actually checks whether the job ID is still on the Sidekiq queue. A mirror that is still queued is never stuck. We need to set the `SidekiqStatus` timeout appropriately, of course.\n\n- [x] Store that JID in the DB at schedule time, not at start time (like initial imports do right now)\n\n- [x] Use that mechanism for forks too, for consistency\n\n- [ ] Treat projects that are in state `started` but don't have a JID as stuck\n\n- [x] Fail early from import/fork/mirror workers when state is not actually `scheduled` (or `none`?)\n\n- [x] Reset `import_error` at finish, NOT at start, since we still want to display it during an update\n\n/cc @stanhu @tiagonbotelho","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-08-07T10:17:47.279Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:49:19.501Z","closed_at":"2017-08-16T15:24:25.129Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","bug::availability","mirror"],"milestone":{"id":315838,"iid":27,"project_id":278964,"title":"9.5","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-05-17T16:56:47.199Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T17:29:38.556Z","due_date":"2017-08-22","start_date":"2017-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/27"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":87854,"username":"DouweM","name":"Douwe Maan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d1548ae618321220679b3a4fda7fb1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DouweM"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3108","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":5},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3108","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3108/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3108/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3108","relative":"#3108","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#3108"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":6356698,"iid":3101,"project_id":278964,"title":"Push rules make use of user-supplied regexps","description":"Just as with coverage regexps in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/24570 , it turns out we allow users to provide regular expressions for the EE `push rules` feature:\n\n![Screenshot_from_2017-08-04_21-11-13](/uploads/63e53facef4a03a25ab8cafaa711880b/Screenshot_from_2017-08-04_21-11-13.png)\n\nWe can fix it in a security release by wiring up `Gitlab::UntrustedRegexp` as for coverage regexps.

Many users do not know they are there or how they could benefit their workflow.\n\n### Proposal\n\nHighlight `Issue Boards` ~~and `Service Desk`~~ with a ~~Tanuki~~ blue dot tooltip. The floating tooltip brings users attention to an area of the UI. Hovering over the blue dot tooltip opens up a quick description of that feature with links to more information. Users can permanently dismiss this message.\n\nService desk is out of scope. It is in scope here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3212\n\n(Replace \"Tanuki\" with \"blue dot\" below)\n\n### Design\n\nQuick codepen mockup (not the finalized design, created for context and discussion):\n\nhttps://codepen.io/sarrahvesselov/pen/VzeqqN/\n\n- Conditionally add a bouncing Tanuki next to the Boards menu item, only if the user has never dismissed it.\n\n- ~~Conditionally add a bouncing Tanuki next to the new Service desk menu item (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3049), only if the user has never dismissed it.~~\n- Service desk is out of scope.

As long as the user has dismissed it once ever in any project, it counts for the entire project. This ensures that the user only ever dismisses a Tanuki once.\n- The bouncing Tanuki appears next to the menu item, as shown in the mockup.\n- When you mouse-over the Tanuki, there is a dropdown with a message, that you can dismiss. If you dismiss the message, you dismiss the entire Tanuki.\n- In the message, there is a link. The link is to the Boards page or the Service desk page, respectively.\n- For CE and EES, show only the Boards Tanuki.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n![Screen_Shot_2017-08-01_at_14.16.51](/uploads/11625612d615b0097eca70d9d24e25bc/Screen_Shot_2017-08-01_at_14.16.51.png)\n\n![2017-08-01_14.18.16](/uploads/9314757628d603086b0b2802179af8ce/2017-08-01_14.18.16.gif)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2017-07-31_at_9.27.22_AM_copy](/uploads/5eb93a99f21588d0074d3325b4ee8fd6/Screen_Shot_2017-07-31_at_9.27.22_AM_copy.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2017-07-31_at_9.27.22_AM](/uploads/fbb42e975cf1ca8f45351a9b3ac8a63a/Screen_Shot_2017-07-31_at_9.27.22_AM.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Design\n\n- So a mouse-over tooltip rather than toggle-able, but with clickable area's\n- Pulsating dot: \n  - [codepen example](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/brWveP)\n  - dot is `8px` by `8px`\n  - dot is `16px` to the right of the text inside the nav element\n- State can be stored with FE data, ~~but is preferred to be stored on the user.. so it persists across devices (otherwise creating ~\"UX debt\" )~~\n\n![peh9k2wd5g](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/5403d5cd2b8fdad29d254cdf67243227/peh9k2wd5g.gif)\n\nand opened:\n\n![boards](/uploads/2511dd5095b880ce3e50ec6ddde10a0a/boards.png)\n\n\nthumbs up icon: ![svg](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/d8974b7440270ad13e719822b4405280/thumb-up.svg) [svg](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/d8974b7440270ad13e719822b4405280/thumb-up.svg)","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-31T13:31:23.751Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:48:46.839Z","closed_at":"2017-08-21T19:39:00.979Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","devops::plan","frontend","type::feature"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":408677,"username":"ClemMakesApps","name":"Clement Ho","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/013b4af8b474654bce8039ecd262a84a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ClemMakesApps"},{"id":489558,"username":"dimitrieh","name":"Dimitrie Hoekstra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/489558/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dimitrieh"},{"id":577113,"username":"hazelyang","name":"Hazel Yang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e84e4d70639ad1177276340868d7f074?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hazelyang"},{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"}],"author":{"id":1296187,"username":"sarrahvesselov","name":"Sarrah Vesselov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1296187/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarrahvesselov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":408677,"username":"ClemMakesApps","name":"Clement Ho","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/013b4af8b474654bce8039ecd262a84a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ClemMakesApps"},"user_notes_count":66,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3054","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3054","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3054/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/3054/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3054","relative":"#3054","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#3054"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24655657,"iid":18954,"project_id":278964,"title":"Multi-select-move issues in boards","description":"### Problem\nOn a board, you can only move on issue at a time.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nThere should be information available to Elasticsearch administrators that informs of the current status of the Index. This should be supported at a high level (XX% Complete) as well as on an individual component level (wiki, project, snippets, etc...).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\nThis information should only be available to GitLab instance administrators.\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\nElasticsearch administration documentation should be updated.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eOld Description\u003c/summary\u003e\nWe had a customer attempt to upgrade GitLab and reindex their Elasticsearch database. They had an issue where no search results turned up, but a quick `curl` test seemed to suggest Elasticsearch did have some data. \n\nRight now it's really difficult to get a high-level view of how many projects, issues, merge requests, etc. have been indexed. Is there a way we can add something to the admin page that shows this data? Ideally, there would also a way to search for a term, see the query it sends, and the results it gets back from Elasticsearch.\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-19T16:25:49.953Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T07:12:49.953Z","closed_at":"2019-10-24T15:14:24.015Z","closed_by":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","advanced search","backend","devops::create","direction","group::editor","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},{"id":3688647,"username":"mvanremmerden","name":"Marcel van Remmerden","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4f46ed49b87eab9e74f20e0e25b36d0f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mvanremmerden"}],"author":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":9,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2973","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2973","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2973/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2973/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2973","relative":"#2973","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#2973"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":428,"epic":{"id":1245,"iid":428,"title":"Elasticsearch admin controls","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/428","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 30, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24655364,"iid":18824,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove build badge path from routes","description":"Older pipeline badges come from the time we still considered everything builds, and the badges for these perform a GET request on `build.svg`.

This lines up with how we allow a logged in user to create issues by email.\n- When an email is sent to that address, create a comment made by the user identified by the `incoming_email_token`.\n\n### Final UX\n\nThe new \"Issue email\" section will live below the \"Reference\" area. The address should be truncated in a similar fashion length and style-wise to Reference, with the icon to Copy. The address itself should be markable so the user can select it, ideally with one click, in the event the Copy button fails. Only the email should be selected/copied.\n\n| Placement, Default State | Selected State |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/0f4d5dcbb9b8dcf657ae150ca9e89c46/image.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_10.51.27_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/a1099c74ccd60a9b3a9777b48aa3f2f5/Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_10.51.27_AM.png) |\n \n\n### Permissions\n\n- The \"Copy Issue Email\" button is only visible to Guest users or above to prevent potential abuse and spam\n- You must be a member of the Project to see and copy the email address.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- GraphQL \n- Pajamas\n\n## Tier\n\n- ~\"GitLab Core\" \n\n## Original Description\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nPlease read this!\n\nThe issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/3243 (New Issue by email) was about adding the ability to answer by mail and open new issues by mail. One of our customer support members however wants to be able to forward an email to an issue after filing the issue.\n\nIs there any hidden trick to do this?\n\nWorkflow:\n\n - Customer contacts support\n - support tries to reproduce bug\n - support files issue in gitlab if it is really a bug\n - sometimes support needs to attach the email to the issue in gitlab\n\n### Design and requirements\n- See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/35264#note_102270136.\n- Given an existing email conversation, when you select \"forward/reply\" or whatever in your email client, the email client is really just automatically generating a new email in compose mode, possibly with a bunch of attachments.\n- You paste in an additional recipient for that new email, namely a special email address that is associated with an existing issue.\n- That entire email's contents are \"sent to the issue\", and appear as a new comment in the issue, with all the attachments attached to that comment.\n- That comment could potentially be very long since it potentially could be the result of a very long email thread with many weird formatting artifacts due to email clients doing their own custom formatting.\n- We need some design to access the special email address associated with an issue. One concept is putting that email address in the sidebar. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/35264#note_44533645\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n![copy issue email url](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/aa243f1d139e84a10d2f0d34229d6ef2/image.png)\n\nTo more efficiently integrate GitLab into your email workflows, each issue now has a personalized email address that can be used to send an email to an issue, which will create a new comment on your behalf. You can now safely say goodbye to manually copying email content and attachments into your GitLab issues.\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-18T18:06:56.919Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:05:09.954Z","closed_at":"2021-01-13T19:47:41.482Z","closed_by":{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/194645/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/digitalmoksha"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","Deliverable","GitLab Core","UX","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::plan","direction","documentation","group::project management","issues","missed-deliverable","missed:13.6","potential proposal","release post item","release post item::in review","reply by email","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":194645,"username":"digitalmoksha","name":"Brett Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/194645/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/digitalmoksha"},{"id":4447636,"username":"sstern","name":"Scott Stern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4447636/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sstern"},{"id":4554611,"username":"hollyreynolds","name":"Holly Reynolds","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554611/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hollyreynolds"}],"author":{"id":827856,"username":"kellertobias","name":"Tobias S.

Because pull and push mirrors are so separate, push mirrors won't benefit from this work. Implementing it naively will result in code duplication.\n\nI think we can get some gains here by moving pull, push and onetime imports into a single table:\n\n\n```ruby\ncreate_table :mirrors do |t|\n  t.string \"url\" # remove `import_url` from the `projects` table\n  t.string \"type\" # import, pull, push\n  t.text \"encrypted_credentials\"\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n\u003cstrike\u003eI'm not clear on why `project_mirror_data` is a separate table to `remote_mirrors`. It may be possible to merge that table in too.\u003c/strike\u003e This is actually for pull mirroring!\n\nThis will look a touch overengineered in CE, but EE will have two additional STI model classes (note that `import` cannot inherit from `pull`, due to the license, but perhaps pull could inherit from import). All three methods can then benefit from identical handling of credentials, UI, etc.\n\nI'm not going to delay implementing SSH pull mirroring to do this refactor, but by the time we want to extend it to push mirroring, I think it should be done on these terms.\n\n/cc @DouweM","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-17T14:13:27.840Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T11:34:58.809Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T16:06:39.355Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","devops::create","maintenance::refactor","mirror","missed-deliverable","missed:11.5","missed:11.6","priority::2"],"milestone":{"id":581385,"iid":22,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.7","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-26T15:14:47.054Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T18:12:10.925Z","due_date":"2019-01-22","start_date":"2018-12-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/22"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2954","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2954","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2954/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2954/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2954","relative":"#2954","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#2954"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":6056959,"iid":2908,"project_id":278964,"title":"REMOVAL - omniauth-kerberos gem may be unmaintained and there are claims it is vulnerable to the \"Zanarotti attack\"","description":"Our Gemfile specifies:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'omniauth-kerberos', '~\u003e 0.3.0', group: :kerberos\n```\n\nThis is the latest release of https://github.com/jgraichen/omniauth-kerberos which has this open issue: https://github.com/jgraichen/omniauth-kerberos/issues/3\n\nI don't currently know enough about kerberos or the claimed attack to know if it is genuine.

Support replication for Docker container registries","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently, Geo only supports replicating Docker registries from a **primary** to a **secondary** using [some form of object storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/docker_registry.html). When using distributed object storage (e.g. S3) for a Docker Registry, the primary and secondary Geo nodes can use the same storage type. This approach does not rely on Geo's native replication ability.\n\nDocker registries on local storage, however, are not yet supported. We are aiming to provide a native Geo, storage-agnostic way of setting up a Registry on a secondary Geo node.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* Large enterprise customers\n\n### Further details\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a storage-agnostic way to setup Registry on a secondary Geo node. There are two steps here:\n\n* Develop a tool that is responsible for transferring images, sort of docker `pull/push` but without needing to set up a docker engine into our omnibus packages. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/3809\n* Develop an event/tracking system for images in GitLab app, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4426\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/docker_registry.html will need to be updated.\n\n### Testing\n\nN/A\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDocker registries using object storage and local storage will be able to be synced.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n* Ultimate\n\n/cc: @jimash, @ayufan","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-06T23:44:26.238Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T19:02:39.715Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T02:52:04.528Z","closed_by":{"id":2683848,"username":"eread","name":"Evan Read","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2683848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eread"},"labels":["Category:Geo Replication","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","container registry expert","customer","devops::systems","direction","group::geo","missed-deliverable","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":65,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2870","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2870","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2870/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/2870/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2870","relative":"#2870","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#2870"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":893,"epic":{"id":4883,"iid":893,"title":"Geo: Add Unreplicated Data Types","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/893","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":6251480,"iid":3027,"project_id":278964,"title":"Slack application: Create landing page","description":"### Resources\nFE @lbennett  \n\nThe landing page is needed to make it possible to implement \"Slack directory -\u003e GitLab flow\".

Since this is part of our HA feature, this is an EEP feature.\n\nOne key difference though between this feature and most of the rest of Postgres HA, is that this is actually part of our GitLab app code. (Whereas much of the rest of Postgres HA is part of the Omnibus code) Since this feature is inside of GitLab, it is aware of the license applied to the instance.\n\nWe should add an EEP license check to the database load balancing code. If there is no license, we shouldn't enable this feature. Some additional details:\n* If there is no license and this has been configured, we should put a banner warning up on the site to warn people the feature is not active. (Unless there is a better idea on how to convey this?)\n* Will need to keep in mind that if the database is having issues we may not be able to query the database to check the license state. Will need to ensure we can validate the license state without having the check back with the database. (This is both steady state as well as startup, since a GitLab app node could be starting up after a failure and the primary node is down.)\n\n---\n\n- Docs

My goal is to revisit this issue and assess whether the latest designs are still \"UX ready\". \n\nAfter reading through this issue, I see that a lot of great thinking and design work has been done.\n\nOverall, after looking at the [latest design mockups](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/pedro/ce%2334059-spec-previews/#artboard0) I would like to recommend some updates and propose how we can break down the final design into smaller MRs. \n\n## Updated proposal \nAs a first step into improving this page. I would like to reduce the amount of elements and calls to action on this page. One fundamental change in the newly proposed design is that the assume that Webhooks have their own view. Which is in conflict with the originally proposed design:\n\n\u003e Webhooks are just another \"integration\" and shouldn't be treated separately\n\nI have proposed to decouple webhooks from integrations, more on that in issue [119429](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/119429)\n\n### This original Issue was moved into an Epic and has been broken down into the following smaller issues:\n1. Decouple Webhooks from Integrations within Project \u003e Settings #119429\n2. Update the page flow, copy and layout on Integrations page #195889 \n3. Add a logo for each integration #195893\n4. Add a way to search/filter integrations #195894\n\n\n\n## Historical Record\n\n### Description\n\nAs part of [Screen_Shot_2017-06-21_at_12.16.38](/uploads/c30c0a4197c01934f0cb7dc8270f3fe0/Screen_Shot_2017-06-21_at_12.16.38.png)).

The reason for that is that they are indeed updated but by gitlab itself, whenever it’s algorithm adds a comment when a merge request was mentioned in a comment. The problem here is that this also seems to happen when a branch containing merge-commits (such as the master) is merged into a working branch. I not sure when GitLab exactly creates the linking, however, my guess is it might be caused by a later rebase when there was some conflict resolution involved when merging the branch in. It’s difficult to tell since gitlab doesn’t tell where on the new merge request the old merge request was mentioned.\n\nHowever solving this won’t solve the whole problem of sorting since updating the description of an old merge request or mentioned it in the comments of another merge request as a developer will still result in updating the last updated timestamp.\n\nA simple solution for this which will solve the problem for us would be another sorting option, sorting by the date when the merge request was finished (closed or merged). Note issue might exist for issues, I haven’t checked that but I think it might make sense to have an option to sort by the “Last closed” and “Oldest closed” as well.\n\nZD: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/78690\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd additional sort options for the merge request lists (group lists, project lists):\n1.

You may also want to check this original ticket if some context is lacking.*\n\nWe are in the process of migrating our Trac setup to GitLab EES. We are heavily using time tracking internally, and our main use case is that when anything that has a time field happen in Trac, a webhook is triggered in our (custom) CRM to generate (1) a feed of events showing the comment and time tracked ![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/30fa849c4cf940b89d91802f23ad49cc/Screen_Shot_2017-06-01_at_16.39.54.png), and (2) an aggregate of the time tracked to calculate our hours worked and overtime as soon as an event happen. ![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/bfd1e6e4dd695cf73aba1206e4fec2e9/Screen_Shot_2017-06-01_at_16.42.36.png)\n\nRight now, the webhook triggered when a note is added, only contained the aggregated time on the whole ticket like so:\n\n```json\n{\n...\n    \"total_time_spent\": 72000,\n    \"human_total_time_spent\": \"2d 4h\",\n...\n}\n```\n\n### Proposal\n\nOur proposal would be to add at least a machine-readable field containing time that got tracked. A human readable field could also be added for convenience, but the machine readable one is actually the most important of the two to digest the webhook easily:\n\n```json\n{\n...\n    \"total_time_spent\": 72000,\n    \"human_total_time_spent\": \"2d 4h\",\n    \"time_change\": 600,\n    \"human_time_change\": \"10m\",\n...\n}\n```\n\nThe advantage of a setup like this is that one could easily plug any time tracking system that can react on webhook or API trigger. The fact that the field is machine-readable also help simplify the parsing of such information.","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-06-07T08:57:30.410Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T18:25:54.498Z","closed_at":"2021-10-07T18:17:52.932Z","closed_by":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"labels":["Category:Team Planning","Category:Webhooks","Community contribution","[deprecated] 🍎","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::plan","group::project management","issues","merge requests","missed:13.10","missed:13.11","missed:13.12","missed:14.0","missed:14.1","missed:14.2","missed:14.3","potential proposal","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","time tracking","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":4355572,"username":"harry-hov","name":"Hariom Verma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4355572/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/harry-hov"}],"author":{"id":130056,"username":"Mayeu","name":"Mayeu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad64aac7cbb81e4b7ff1f3fa92350aaa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Mayeu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4355572,"username":"harry-hov","name":"Hariom Verma","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4355572/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/harry-hov"},"user_notes_count":37,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":13,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18407","time_stats":{"time_estimate":18000,"total_time_spent":7200,"human_time_estimate":"5h","human_total_time_spent":"2h"},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/18407","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/18407/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/18407/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#18407","relative":"#18407","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#18407"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5147,"epic":{"id":176823,"iid":5147,"title":"Merge Request Webhook Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5147","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24654273,"iid":18403,"project_id":278964,"title":"Can't Choose File after update Group Settings fails due to Name containing special characters","description":"### Summary\n\nThis is almost identical to gitlab-ce#29426, except this is on the Group settings of an existing group rather than during the 'Add Group' process.\nBasically, on updating Group Settings if you provide an image but the update failed (in my case was because I had braces in the Name) then you'll no longer be able to upload an image and the 'remove avatar' button is present.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

First, we should make this information available on the environment performance dashboard with the work we are doing in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33345 to add support for additional lines series in a single chart. This will allow us to be able to render things like quartiles, but we can also leverage it to overlay the performance of the Canary vs. Stable tracks. \n\nGoing further, we should think about how we can calculate the difference in behavior between the two tracks. For example we could leverage the legend data box to provide additional insight. This area is where we show the actual values of the data for the point in time you are currently hovering over. As part of this work we could:\n1. Add the details for the additional canary line series to the legend\n1. But we should also provide a percentage comparison relative to the same metric between the `stable` and `canary` tracks. \n\nFor example, this may look something like:\n* Stable CPU Utilization - Average: 35%\n* Canary CPU Utilization - Average: 56% (`+60%`)\n\nWhere the percentage difference between the tracks is displayed for easy comparison. \n\nThe one area we need to be careful of when trying to calculate the relative difference, is that these values may not be always comparable depending on the metric. For example when dealing with sums across multiple pods like the total error rate across all pods, the canary track will only be getting a small percentage of the traffic. This means the number of requests handled will be smaller, throwing off the comparisons. Perhaps we could flag the metrics that are directly comparable (error percentage, for example) as part of our metric description file, as well as an indicator about which direction is good/bad so we can color the text.\n\nDeliverables:\n1.

To do this within GitLab they have to have two windows open, one on the code and one on the Merge Request page to see the Code Quality changes. This back and forth is inefficient and makes it easy to miss critical code quality issues.\n\nNow you can see in the Merge Request changes tab the line that introduced a code quality violation and severity so you can quickly identify the most critical issues to resolve as part of that Merge Request. Hovering over the icon provides details about the violation.\n\n### Problem to Solve\n\nWhen considering changes between branches/in an MR, one of the most important factors for teams to consider is impact to quality.  We already offer quality metrics, but we can improve this by showing code quality remarks in the diff prior to accepting a change. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who is reviewing a change from a team member and wants to see the code quality issues from the Merge Request widget in the diff view for easier context.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to see code quality violations in context of the source in the MR diff view of the [GitLab UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/#merge-request-navigation-tabs-at-the-top).\n\n### Further details\n\nThis utilizes the existing data from the CodeQuality scan.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\nWhen changes to code quality exist, the following acceptance criteria is valid:\n\n* Add an icon indicating code quality severity to the diff area of a merge request.\n  * Icon size should be `12x12` pixels.\n  * We will display a different icon for each severity level. UI of icons should replicate the ones defined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199187\n* Only one (1) code quality severity will be display per line.\n* When a code quality severity icon is present, the indentation of the lines in the diff after the number of the line needs to be increased by `20px`. The code quality icon is added *before* the + or - sign in the diff UI.\n* Hovering the icon should display a tooltip that reads the cause for the severity alert.\n* Clicking the icon should trigger a modal. The modal should display:\n  * Title: ***Code quality*** `[degraded/improved]`: `[description of the degradation]`\n  * Body: description, file path and line number, severity.\n  * Footer: close button.\n\n#### Out of scope for this iteration\n\n* It happen that multiple code quality changes happen to the same line of code, but this MVC ignores that case for now and just shows the first code quality degradation.\n* The severity icon does not support a text label for now. Only a tooltip is displayed on hover.\n* Updates to the color or the severity icons are also out of scope, and this MVC should replicate the existing icons/color available in the application.\n* No other actions (such a giving the user the ability to fix the vulnerability, or open an issue) will be available in the modal.\n\nThe Design for this can be seen below and in the [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/2xyEtC1JM1ClKGNhpTcZXR/Testing-coverage-widget?node-id=529%3A871).\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen a code quality report exists on a merge request the code quality violations can be shown for the existing and added code. Display them as shown in the design below.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html --\u003e\n\n* Update the [feature documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html) with content about what uploading a code quality report on target and source branch does in MRs.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThe biggest risk for this is load time on the diff view. Ideally this will be behind a feature flag and can be enabled on a project by project basis for early testing/dogfooding within gitlab and Self Managed customers as they desire.\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] When a Merge Request Pipeline has a Code Quality job that runs successfully the Changes tab will show annotations as noted in the design in the code.\n- [ ] Time to first paint for the diff view increases by less than 5% as measured on the gitlab-org project before fully enabled.\n- [ ] Text has been approved by Tech writer (@eread for this issue)\n- [ ] Documentation for the feature is updated to show this capability / how to enable it (upload files)\n- [ ] Tracking is put into place for users at the proper license tier who view the mr diff view AND have code quality data loaded\n\n#### Measures of Success\n* Within 90 days of launch we expect 5000 unique users per month to view a diff page with code quality content on it.\n* Tracking will be done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267626\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n[Alex](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#alex---the-application-development-manager) and [Dakota](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/#dakota---the-application-development-director) want their team(s) to start tackling the tech debt identified by GitLab's Code Quality scanner and know that it's too hard to do this as part of Code Reviews today.\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nYes, the ~\"group::source code\" team has been notified.\n\n\u003c!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\n### Links / references\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eInitial Designs for the feature \u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\nThese designs were used for the new designs in the design tab below.\n\n#### Frontend\n\n1.

This works well - but when distributing project access to a group across many projects, access can only be granted project-by-project in the UI. \n\nSince GitLab doesn't support sharing a group with a group, this means adding the group to individual projects. This is time-consuming, and GitLab should support sharing groups with groups. \n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd \"Share with group\" to Groups.

all features of Jupyter notebooks display properly in GitLab\n\n## Proposal\n\nIntegrate the nbviewer.js library to GitLab to solve these rendering issues for good. Something like a w3 would be enough to assess.\n\n## Further Details\n\nThe linked notebook below is from a Github repo that the Jupyter team often use to demonstrate the latest capabilities.  This `Rich Output.ipynb` file is therefore a good benchmark against which to measure the rendering capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks within Gitlab.\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Rich%20Output.ipynb\nhttp://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython-in-depth/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Rich%20Output.ipynb\n\nI've reproduced some screenshots of where things are broken.  Gitlab is on the left, Github in the middle and nbviewer on the right. The rendering within Gitlab is generally good, and in some cases better than Github, but there are still a few glitches, namely:\n\n* Embedded images have problems rendering and when they do, they appear to show a clipped version of the original.\n* Latex rendering is not working at all.\n\n* Embedded web-page links are not working ... the `nbviewer` rendering on the right is correct\n\n| GitLab | GitHub | nbviewer |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Embedded Images GL | Embedded Images GH | Embedded Images nbv |\n| ![image](/uploads/e377055e5dbd99efc5f392b34366f430/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/4dacfca20cca49879725c41459b27ca8/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/860cf0122b0485767454137143f9e1f5/image.png) |\n| LaTeX GL | LaTeX GH | LaTeX nbv |\n| ![image](/uploads/a5d9c0434940ab166b82465f92333b27/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/b91614a887aeb7e6b0566dffcf49b16b/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/5770858a3bd34a88951af91c635a424d/image.png) |\n| Embedded webpage GL | Embedded webpage GH | Embedded webpage nbv |\n| ![image](/uploads/f4cb0d71cb4e3d3aa81077f30c2b443d/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/09a5d62c97f35a31105705b4f3f3ec59/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/cc18fbc208b7bf63602445fe8ac742cc/image.png) |\n\n## Release Notes\n\nJupyter notebooks are documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They are widely use for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more. They are capable of using \"rich output\" to show an object's rendered representation, such as HTML, JPEG, SVG, or LaTeX files. However, in order to take advantage of the rich output, users had to open the notebook inside Jupyter.\n\nGitLab 13.8 now shows these files types with \"rich output\", showing you the rendered version of the file. This is an excellent way both to preview changes to your files as well as consume Jupyter notebook without ever having to leave GitLab.\n\n![mockup](/uploads/fdea9dd62c687de07ca545b194e31c89/jupyter_rich_output.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-05-23T13:04:12.728Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T07:23:56.846Z","closed_at":"2021-01-14T12:16:49.418Z","closed_by":{"id":853414,"username":"andr3","name":"André Luís","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/241e39726efb512a29621070ccf26a90?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andr3"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","GitLab Core","customer","devops::create","direction","frontend","group::source code","release post item","release post item::in review","repository","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"}],"author":{"id":209590,"username":"mccoole","name":"Colum McCoole","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9cb074a0c5a33c7f1e6ad89498b468e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mccoole"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017300,"username":"jboyson","name":"Justin Boyson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017300/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jboyson"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":32,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18258","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/18258","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/18258/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/18258/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#18258","relative":"#18258","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#18258"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":67,"epic":{"id":132,"iid":67,"title":"Improve support for Jupyter notebook viewing","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/67","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":5482230,"iid":2468,"project_id":278964,"title":"Check LDAP external users at sign in","description":"#### Overview\n\nExternal users in GitLab have restricted permissions and must be explicitly added to a project/group for access - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#external-users\n\nThe LDAP group sync option [`external_users`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/ldap-ee.html#external-groups) offers the ability to specify a group that contains \"external users\".

It's not an option. What is an option is to set the number of required approvals to be zero.\n- We need to keep the required approvals to be zero, because we do not want to block the initial onboarding flow when you create a merge request. We want to let people immediately merge their own merge requests without blockers. Having just one approver will be a blocker because you can't approve your own merge request.\n\n## Results\n\nThe scope of this issue was trimmed down, #6346 has been created as a follow-up for polishing the approval settings.\n\n#### Project settings\n\n| Always enabled approvals in the merge request settings | Approval settings with added / users groups | Approval settings behaviour |\n| - | - | - |\n| ![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/3e0d5a325cf5f2b6380ca0c050ae52f1/current.png) | ![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/30ec3c4c47d44f93b53be4ee92d1aac4/mr-settings-after-2.png) | ![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/1f3dc351c41b69e5e4d4baddfa74da56/fixed-bs4-regressions.webm) |\n\n#### Merge request widget\n\nThe approval section in the merge request widget can now be rendered with zero required approvals:\n\n| unapproved with ability to approve | unapproved with _no_ ability to approve | approved |\n| - | - | - |\n| ![zero-able](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/3dec33e26bc995504c39d76888308c92/zero-able.png) | ![zero-no-rights](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/83f95b2355af35750c50411a53f0edfa/zero-no-rights.png)| ![zero-approved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/12979ddb13b6afded4006f69430f9772/zero-approved.png) |\n\n## Original Specification\n\n### Project settings\n- In the project settings, we remove the activation checkbox. It is just there. But by default, the number of required approvals is zero, and it can be changed to zero. Also, the entire approvals section is now it's own collapsible section in the project settings.\n- The design of the table of added approvers is simplified to just two textbooks where you set who can approve (users and groups) and how many.\n\n![c-00-project-settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/68344ac114360dea76d9d785bd596cfd/c-00-project-settings.png)\n\n### Merge request widget and settings\n\n- Remove the approvers UI from the new/edit merge request form.\n- The approval section still remains in the MR widget even if a number of approvals is zero.\n    - It shows `No approval required; you can still approve [question mark]` message in the section.\n    - It has the \"Approve\" button even if the required approvals is `0`.\n    - The icon before the message: `check-circle`\n- There is a \"Settings\" button in the approval section which allows users to configure the approvals directly.\n- If the approvals are not required, the button will be a secondary button in blue.\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/c54cc58b240b3bc0a9c641a2e1ecabe7/image.png)\n- On the \"Expand to set the approvals\" screen, if users enable it and save changes, they will see the \"01 -

GitLab.com Pricing Plans","description":"## Background \n\nPlease see related issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customers-gitlab-com/issues/147\n\n * Certain features that are behind an add-on have been adjusted to apply to a group level https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2019\n * Existing EE features are currently being treated in the same way https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2335\n * GitLab.com will not currently have these plans activated, as such all users are currently getting full EEP features as before\n \nThis issue describes what needs to be done to activate these plans with 9.4 roll-out once we have added all features to the license check, updated GitLab.com Pricing Page and improved and automated the payment flow.\n\n## Todo\n\n- [x] Execute query to set all users who purchased plans before 9.4 rollout onto their current plan with a SQL query\n- [x] All existing users and groups to be grandfathered using a query such as `UPDATE namespaces SET plan = 'early_adopter' WHERE plan IS NULL AND created_at \u003c :some_date` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2391 this should be done early and re-executed again once the namespace level licensing is turned on.

`not` filtering in issue/mr/epic list views and boards","description":"## Problem\nFinding and filtering issues, merge requests, and epics can be difficult, especially when users want to exclude certain results. GitLab does not currently support excluding results from filtering, only implicit AND operations.\n\nFor example, if a user had 3 exclusive labels: bug, security, feature and were using milestones, it is impossible to filter by milestone and then find all issues in the milestone that are labeled security or feature.\n\n## Proposal\n- Search for issues, merge requests, and epics in the search bar using a not operator.\n- Same for search bar in boards\n- Currently, all search filters/attributes are implicitly AND-ed together. This feature does not change that. It only adds a `not` condition to individual filters.\n- The `not` condition applies to labels, authors, assignees, and milestones.\n- The `not` condition also includes \"absence\":\n  - `not(assignee: @ebrinkman)` includes unassigned\n  - `not(label: ~Discussion)` includes unlabeled\n  - `not(milestone: %\"9.1\")` includes no milestone\n\n### Example\n`author: @ebrinkman assignee: @ebrinkman assignee: @smcgivern not(assignee: @jschatz1) label: ~Discussion not(milestone: %\"9.3\")`\n\nThis means find all issues that:\n  - Are authored by @ebrinkman \n  - AND have @ebrinkman as an assignee\n  - AND have @smcgivern as an assignee\n  - AND do not have @jschatz1 as an assignee\n  - AND has the label gitlab-ce~874211 \n  - AND does not have milestone gitlab-ce%\"9.3\"\n\n### Tier\n\nSee parent epic for tier explanation https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/291\n\n## Solution\n\n**Interaction and design**\n\nExample of interactions (not styled)\n![notoperator3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/1dddaee2b2f71190c6698d9b1913eb28/notoperator3.mov)\n\nDesign\n![Not_filtering](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/a4d6f1438957deedef052aabea79d526/Not_filtering.png)\n\n**Requirements**\n###### All\n*  Remove the item `Press enter or click to search` from all dropdowns.\n*  The first item in the dropdown list is in a focus state by default, user can press or type [enter/return] to select it. This allows us to cut down on keystrokes for users and preselects smart defaults.\n\n###### Field (ie: milestone)\nInteractions are mostly the same except:\n*   *If possible:* User can type value without colon(:) , ie if a user types milestone [space] milestone will tokenize. Can we just assume that if a user types one of the known fields that they are attending to apply it in the filter bar and act as such?\n*  If user has no value (ie: %13.1) defined, they may still click into the field token to trigger the dropdown (similar to if you click on a value token and it turns to text and triggers the dropdown options) and change the field. If there is a value defined the behavior is as it currently is (can’t edit, only delete).\n*  The first item in the dropdown list is in a focus state by default, user can press or type [enter/return] to select it.\n*  Remove hint/help text after the field (ie: @ assignee ), remove the colon if we can allow users to type fields without milestones.

Instead, just the markup is imported and they will link to external sources for the img src, e.g. on https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/[...]\n\nIdeally, the importer should scrape images and host them in GitLab's system that is used when you attach an image to an issue.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nDuring import from GitHub, migrate any images to GitLab and update the links in the markdown for these images to the new GitLab URLs.\n\n## Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/75890\n\n## Documentation blurb\n\n1.

settings** approval settings. This improvement was a part of a chain of improvements that I wasn't wholly aware of. I didn't read everything correctly and ended up implementing the full UX improvement design for the **new/edit MR page** approval settings. About half way through, talking to @victorwu, I realise I am working out of the scope of the issue. Instead of improving the MR page from scratch, I was meant to be improving on top of already merged changes to the project settings page.\n\nSo, we highlighted from this that the 2 approval settings have different implementations.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/1656 is the MR where I start to add the new design to the MR page. It uses droplab over select2 so is closer to our final desired implementation.\n\nThe MR page approval settings will get more use than the project settings so we should probably schedule the MR page to be updated with the new designs (i.e. completing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/1656) and then one last MR to DRY the 2 implementations, thus removing the use of select2 from the project settings.\n\n/cc @victorwu @jschatz1\n\n### Dependencies\nDo this first, which is re-designing the merge request web form: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2228\n\n### Scope of work to be done in this issue\n\n- The existing approvals settings in the project settings and the merge request web form has shared UI and functionality.

Iteration over each blob to count the number of lines will be quite expensive and to make it performant on gitlab.com scale will be quite the challenge :smile: Bytes are chosen as Git stores the size of each blob with its name. So if a blob has the path `path/to/file.rb` it can take the extension and detect it's Ruby. It already has the number of bytes, so it can move on.\n\n\u003e Lines however is harder, as now you'd have to either iterate each blob each time, or be clever with caching combined with diffing, which in turn might lead to race conditions.\n\n\u003e That all being said, this would require a new RPC to Gitaly, and gitaly-proto changes.

A \"secret\" group with no membership inheritance can't have subgroups. For example:\n\n* Top-level group\n  * Subgroup A (inheritance, further nesting allowed)\n    * Sub-subgroup B (inheritance, further nesting allowed)\n  * Secret subgroup A (no inheritance, no further subgroups allowed)\n  * Secret subgroup B (no inheritance, no further subgroups allowed)\n\nThat would handle situations like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30785#note_215856222.\n\n1. Owners can always get inherited. If we toggle membership inheritance, there's a chance we leave Owners behind and could have a weird situation of an Owner-less group.
