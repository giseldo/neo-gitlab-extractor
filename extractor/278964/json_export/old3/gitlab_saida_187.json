Our current implementation, however, requires a user to register for GitLab.com first and then find the `/billings` page to start a trial.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should be able to offer a flow for someone who has never signed up for GitLab.com before - they'd be able to click \"free trial\" on an about.gitlab.com page, and register for GitLab.com. On finishing their registration, they should immediately be placed into a free Gold trial.\r\n\r\nBy solving this issue, we should be able to offer a \"Free Trial\" button on https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/, much like we have for self-hosted.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\n1. After submitting the trial form from the [unified trial page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate-marketing/issues/80) on `about.gitlab.com`, route the user to sign-in/register at https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in if they don't have an active session.\r\n    - If the user signs in, redirect to the namespace picker.\r\n    - If the user registers, apply the trial to the new user's personal namespace.\r\n\r\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\r\n\r\n(If no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this)\r\n\r\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-31T18:55:09.814Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T13:40:26.083Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T13:40:25.989Z","closed_by":{"id":4413992,"username":"s_awezec","name":"Sam Awezec","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4413992/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/s_awezec"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","UX","backend","devops::growth","frontend","group::acquisition","priority::1","trials"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

database of Gitlab Geo secondary?\nIn Gitlab doc\u003chttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/database.html\u003e, as far as I understand, Gitlab Omnibus will configure the DB replication as well. But in case of RDS, we don’t have access to Postgres host (can’t touch pg_hba.conf…), because AWS takes care of replication. We only hook Gitlab to these existing databases. However it’s not clear to me how to do that with /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb . I would be great if you can give me some info or docs to configure Gitlab Geo on AWS, especially RDS-related part. \n\n**What questions are you trying to answer?**\n\nI think that this should work with a couple of hurdles such as that the steps [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/database.html#external-postgresql-instances) don't appear to be configurable [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.html#Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Parameters) and that the customer wants to use the AWS RDS Read Replica for replication.\n\n**What does success look like at the end of the project?**\n\nA documented guide to install GitLab Geo using AWS RDS Read Replicas.\n\n### Work required in this issue:\n\nSince we have more customers using (or looking at using) AWS RDS, we need to have more information available for them about what they can expect. We need to set up an installation for ourselves using RDS and document the process. \n\n### Links / references:\nZD: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/102621 (Internal Only)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-28T00:20:17.313Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T20:04:55.490Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T01:50:04.809Z","closed_by":{"id":2683848,"username":"eread","name":"Evan Read","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2683848/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eread"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Geo Administration","customer","database","devops::systems","documentation","group::geo","ha","workflow::in review","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":655279,"iid":27,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.10","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-21T19:08:16.261Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T09:17:49.051Z","due_date":"2019-04-22","start_date":"2019-03-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/27"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":1147472,"username":"amulvany","name":"Adam Mulvany","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1147472/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amulvany"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7360","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7360","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7360/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7360/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7360","relative":"#7360","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7360"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13700653,"iid":7347,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Constantly reverify repositories","description":"## Problem\n\nDue to bugs or transient infrastructure problems, it is possible for git repos to change unexpectedly without being marked for verification.\n\n## Possible solution\n\nWhen there is available capacity, we should reverify non-failed repos.\n\nWe need to rate limit this work.

This is an issue for users of GitLab who are planning and managing projects as parent epic due dates are typically incorrect, unless managed tightly.\n\n## Proposal\n- An epic's dates can take on its issue's milestone dates.\n- We should expand that existing feature, so it considers its subepics' dates automatically too. \n- In particular, we should _not_ introduce any new options in the date fields for epics. It should continue to have only two options: Fixed versus Inherited/Dynamic. Fixed logic doesn't change. (It's just fixed.) Inherited logic _does_ change.\n- If you are considering the start date of an epic, and you have chosen Inherited mode, then you look at all your issues and subepics (only at the first level), and look at all those milestone start dates (of those issues), and all those subepic start dates.

Epics must be created independently and then manually linked together. Top down planning often starts with a parent epic and cascades into children epics and issues. GitLab should support this workflow.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Create child epic from epic, similar to creating an issue in the board and from the epic (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5419)\n- The child epic is an epic in the same group as the original epic.\n\n### Design\n![Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_9.29.18_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/37425ba559c37811f44a81cf9b69ec2f/Screen_Shot_2019-03-26_at_9.29.18_AM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-03-25_at_1.27.23_PM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/5c1b3c5968a131c67c6d7885f1d4e750/Screen_Shot_2019-03-25_at_1.27.23_PM.png)\n\n* Change the `+` button to a [split button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/#split-button)\n* Dropdown options are `Add existing epic` and `Create new epic`\n* `Add existing epic` should act like normal (paste a link into the existing form)\n* `Create new epic` will render form to add a title (\"New epic title\") and button will say \"Create epic\" (ignore the \"Submit epic\" in screenshot)\n* The last selection should be stored per-user. So if the user selects \"Create epic\" then that choice should always be the default action until the user selects the other option\n* Default choice when this feature is implemented should be \"Add existing epic\"\n\n~\"internal customer\" since I want to be able to have an idea, start creating an epic, and then create additional epics to break down the work, one by one.\n\u003c!--

![Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7.29.33_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/00c08e7912477235b9566ab24f09b026/Screen_Shot_2019-03-27_at_7.29.33_AM.png) |\n\n* First tab is discussion - comments, threads, and system notes\n* Second tab is the tree view. All epics and issues nested under the current epic should be viewable, collapsible, ~~and draggable~~ (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7327#note_151840087)\n   * Dropdown on tree view allows you to view `Entire tree`, `Epics only`, and `Issues only`\n   * Removing an epic also removes all of its nested epics from the _current epic only_ (it doesn't break existing relationships between epics)\n   * Dialog to confirm removal\n* Third tab is roadmap- current epic should show, along with every nested epic\n   * There's limited space, so we'll have to show fewer quarters/months/weeks than the regular roadmap view\n   * There might end up being a button to go directly to Roadmap\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This

This is to ensure that no-one outside our company (or our clients') is added to our group. And also any employee added is registered with their corporate email account rather than a personal one so that when their corporate email account becomes inactive they lose access to GitLab.\n\n### Further details\n\nThe use case for this is we regularly add users to GitLab. It's easy to mistakenly add the wrong account to the group (e.g. a personal account, or just selecting the wrong account from the autocomplete box).\n\nIdeally we'd also be able to restrict members to use federated login (e.g. Google Sign-in) so that when their corporate Google Apps account they will no-longer be able to access GitLab.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### Settings\n\n![settings](/uploads/78f41d3c91469422c4410b74952d9f09/settings.png)\n\nWe will add this new setting under the `Permissions, LFS and 2FA` section settings in Group General Settings. We will add a new text input with the following attributes:\n\n- Title: `Restrict membership by email`\n- Placeholder: `Enter domain`\n- Help text: `Only users with an email address in this domain can be added to the group.\u003cbr\u003eExample: \u003ccode\u003e*@ gitlab.com\u003c/code\u003e. Some common domains are not allowed. Read more`\n- Link to documentation TBD\n\n##### Common domains\n\n![settings--domain-not-allowed](/uploads/f8ef2f71e272413a6f1058fe509cbffb/settings--domain-not-allowed.png)\n\nWe will not allow users to restrict membership to common domains like gmail.com, outlook.com, yahoo.com, etc. These domains will be listed in the docs. When the user enters one of these domains, the page will show an inline error on refresh after the user presses the Save button:\n\n#### Inviting new members by email\n\nWhen inviting new members to the group via email, we will validate addresses directly on the Frontend:\n\n| Right domain | Wrong domain |\n| ------------ | ------------ |\n| ![invite-email-right](/uploads/5fabd7e3632895ec67f628299525c82f/invite-email-right.png) | ![invite-email-wrong](/uploads/ac605dbbe0a89135f209cfcdbc343e45/invite-email-wrong.png) |\n\nIf the address the user entered doesn't belong to the right domain, the dropdown row will be greyed out and a warning line will be added:\n\n\u003e This email address cannot be invited because it’s not in the *@ gitlab.com domain\n\n#### Adding existing users\n\n| Right domain | Wrong domain |\n| ------------ | ------------ |\n| ![add-members](/uploads/92e1fb06d2646a1628010284c45160eb/add-members.png) | ![add-members-error](/uploads/fe84273b5399929a9f15a4d096d175a5/add-members-error.png) |\n\nFor adding existing users we will use the same interface we use now. We will simply change the help text under the main text field to inform users of the domain restriction:\n\n\u003e Search for existing users or invite new ones using their email address. New members must have an email address in the *@gitlab.com domain.\n\nWhen the user clicks the `Add to group` button, the backend will check whether the users can be added to the group. If any of the specified users could not be added to the group, they will show up in the text field upon refresh, and an inline error message will be attached:\n\n\u003e These users were not added because their email addresses are not in the right domain\n\n\n### Original proposal\n\n- Allow entering a whitelist of member domains in the group settings, configurable by Owners.\n- Only members with primary emails that match the defined mask can be added to the group. Other members should return an error.\n- Only matching members should be displayed as results in the member autocomplete.\n\nFor the first iteration, we'll leave existing members that do not meet the whitelist in the group. The whitelist should apply only to new members.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n - Success would be mean increased security for corporate GitLab projects. \n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-20T11:15:10.839Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T06:02:10.837Z","closed_at":"2019-08-19T13:44:24.010Z","closed_by":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"labels":["Category:Subgroups","Category:User Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Manage [DEPRECATED]","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","customer","depth","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","group::authentication and authorization","movingtogitlab","priority::2","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":693521,"iid":35,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/08/22/gitlab-12-2-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:48:32.567Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:20.799Z","due_date":"2019-08-22","start_date":"2019-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/35"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1702559,"username":"lukeb","name":"Luke Benstead","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c3ee3c14de612a52a5d0d94b34e92a04?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lukeb"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":47,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":16,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7297","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7297","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7297/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7297/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7297","relative":"#7297","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7297"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":84,"epic":{"id":151,"iid":84,"title":"Improved group and team access control","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/84","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24665850,"iid":23746,"project_id":278964,"title":"Error 500 when trying to destroy OAuth application entry in admin area","description":"### Summary\n\nI tried to set up GitLab as OpenID Connect identity provider, but I was unsuccessful (because of gitlab-ce#44332).

If you change to `Due date`, then the direction will be automatically changed to descending, per the above list.\n\nSay you then change to ascending. Then you log into GitLab with another device and go to the epics list, it will be `Due date (ascending)`.\n\nWhen you first visit epics or roadmaps and nothing is stored in the BE, then you should get `Created date (descending)` by default.\n\nThe values are unique per instance and shared across epic lists and roadmap views. So if you go to Group A and look at the epics list, and say you select `Due date (descending)`. Then you go to Group B and look at the roadmap view.

Leading up to the GCP migration, I spent many hours verifying, fixing, and reverifying uploads. We've fixed a lot of bugs in the process, and GitLab.com has switched to hashed storage for uploads, but sysadmins need *assurance* of data integrity or at least an indication that data needs to be fixed, in order to trust a DR solution.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add service to verify Uploads on secondaries\n* Add service to checksum Uploads on primary\n* Automatically verify Uploads on secondaries\n* Ensure Upload checksum on primary\n* Track primary Upload checksum counts\n* Track secondary Upload verification counts\n* When a primary Upload is checksummed, reset verification on secondaries\n* Regularly reverify Uploads on primary\n* Let admins adjust file verification rate\n* Allow verification of files in Object Storage\n\n##### Metrics\n\nWe should track the number of `uploads` that have passed vs failed verification. We could group by known failures too, but on second thought I don't think it is necessary on the first iteration. Most of the value is in having charts of passed vs failed.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nAvailable metrics:\n\n* Number of verified uploads\n* Number of failed verification uploads\n\n### Questions\n\n* Should the non-Geo-specific work go into CE? =\u003e No: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7184#note_120279789\n*Answer:* Not right

full scan for DAST","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nRight now DAST is relying on Passive Scan by ZAP. This is safe as it doesn't perform any real attack, but it can spot only a portion of the possible vulnerabilities.\n\nZAP has also Active Scan that performs several additional checks. We can make the behavior available when a specific environment variable is set, without changing anything in the job definition.\n\n### Further details\n\n- The active scan may take a long time to finish, and so it should not be the default option.\n- The active scan is performed as a part of the [full scan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7182#note_159859123) by ZAP. So, there's a consensus over changing the term from _\"active scan for DAST\"_ to _\"full scan for DAST\"_.\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement Full Scan for ZAP to support additional DAST checks in Auto DevOps.\n\nIf the environment variable `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED` is set, the tool will be executed with a different set of options to enable Full Scan against the given target.\n\nThis will be supported out of the box, and it will not require any change in the job configuration. This option will be available for the vendored default DAST template, and for Auto DevOps.\n\nMetrics should be collected as described in the next section.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nNumber of pipelines executed with the `DAST_FULL_SCAN_ENABLED` set.\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAscan\n\n### Execution\n\n- [x] ~~Modify the [Python wrapper script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/blob/master/src/zap-baseline.py) to accept the boolean command line argument `--enable-active-scan`; if set it passes the same set of arguments down to the `zap-full-scan.py` instead of `zap-baseline.py` (they accept identical sets of arguments)~~ (see next)\n- [x] Add `zap-full-scan.py` to DAST Docker image\n- [x] Add shell code to the script in `DAST.gitlab-ci.yml` vendored template that sets `--enable-active-scan` if `DAST_ACTIVE_SCAN_ENABLED` is set; [not sure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9592#note_159523963) if we need to support ENV var checking in the DAST tool itself\n- [x] Add [tests and expectations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/tree/master/test) for Active Scan for `webgoat` project\n- [x] Update the README for DAST\n- ~~[ ] Add Usage Ping for number of pipelines executed with `DAST_ACTIVE_SCAN_ENABLED` to EE~~ a [follow-up issue added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/11480)\n- [x] Add documentation to EE on new DAST env var with description\n- [ ] Auxiliary: add notes on using ENV vars vs command line flags to [standardization notes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9592) for security products: _ENV vars must be used by tools only in cases when underlying CLI tool does not provide a command line flag for it;

When we create the [`UploadFile` object](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/uploaded_file.rb#L60), we don't url decode the name, so we're using by default the encoded name, which is wrong. When we build the `UploadFile` we should decode and build the object with the proper name.\n\nBesides, the [sanitization method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/uploaded_file.rb#L75) we use is quite rigid, and it would even convert valid file name characters. Instead of using the `CarrierWave::SanitizedFile.sanitize_regexp` regex we could use [`ActiveStorage`](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveStorage/Filename/sanitized) one. Nevertheless, since we don't load the `ActiveStorage` library, we could use directly the code `ActiveStorage` uses. See [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/23612#note_241819855) and [`ActiveStorage#sanitize` code](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveStorage/Filename/sanitized) to learn more.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-08T04:07:15.305Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T02:05:14.024Z","closed_at":"2021-07-05T02:05:14.009Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["UX","auto closed","auto updated","awaiting feedback","backend","devops::create","group::editor","priority::4","reproduced on GitLab.com","section::dev","severity::4","stale","type::bug","vintage","web edit","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

However the plan shouldn't be to use traditional tabs, instead to be anchors (See this comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23390#note_329937475)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n[Artboard_3](/uploads/39bef7e884cc22954eb107497c78f226/Artboard_3.png)\n\n![scrolling](/uploads/b2e62e432cae3b04c5ffbc6a29e843be/scrolling.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-07T20:43:58.688Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T18:24:39.770Z","closed_at":"2021-03-16T12:38:37.854Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Deliverable","award emoji","backstage [DEPRECATED]","bug::performance","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":1212235,"username":"winh","name":"Inactive Account","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e34b010c96ff3f44c62cddf66607232a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/winh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23607","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/23607","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/23607/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/23607/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#23607","relative":"#23607","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#23607"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":278,"epic":{"id":575,"iid":278,"title":"Award emoji cleanup","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/278","group_id":9970,"human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e730\u003c/strong\u003e days elapsed"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13283986,"iid":7145,"project_id":278964,"title":"Simplify milestone / epic date-handling code","description":"Follow-up for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6448.\n\nWe need to set the milestone date _and milestone ID_ for epics. We need to recompute these when a milestone date is updated, an issue has its milestone updated, an epic has an issue added to it, or an epic has an issue deleted from it.\n\nThis has lead to some complicated code. In the existing MR, we didn't see a way around this, but maybe fresh eyes and the benefit of time will help. These can be separate issues, but for now, I'm creating them as one issue:\n\n1. The name [`DateSourcingMilestonesFinder`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/59738cdccb45806ed4269414f5f5df5310eee2ee/ee/app/finders/epics/date_sourcing_milestones_finder.rb) is a bit convoluted (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6448#note_92436551)\n   1. The finder itself might not be the right type of class for this, as it builds a query and returns column values, not ActiveRecord objects (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6448/diffs#note_92849483).\n   2. (Minor.) There is a large query written in SQL, which probably could be expressed in ActiveRecord (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6448#note_92695494).\n2. [`Epic.update_start_and_due_dates`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/59738cdccb45806ed4269414f5f5df5310eee2ee/ee/app/models/ee/epic.rb#L85) is also quite complicated.\n   1. To make the updates more efficient, we group epics with the same set of milestones together (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6448#note_92695856) - this in itself is fiddly.\n   2. Ideally, we could write one `UPDATE` statement and move much of the computation to SQL. This might not be possible, though.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-07T09:04:02.149Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:25:44.545Z","closed_at":"2019-02-04T08:31:18.289Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::plan","epics","maintenance::refactor","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":581391,"iid":23,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.8","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-26T15:15:18.359Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T17:33:19.162Z","due_date":"2019-02-22","start_date":"2019-01-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/23"},"assignees":[{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"}],"author":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7145","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7145","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7145/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7145/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7145","relative":"#7145","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7145"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13269051,"iid":7132,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support go in Dependency Scanning (alpha* because the scanner viable but limited results/findings)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nUsers of Go, including ourselves, would like to monitor our dependencies (specific libraries) for vulnerabilities.\n\nNow that we have started ingesting go vulnerabilities [mr](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/merge_requests/429) and [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/35694) we can do an MVC and test this out.\n\nNote: this implementation will be only for projects that support go modules.

It's hard to find the projects and groups I'm personally working in.\n\nFor projects, I can star a project and mark it as favorite.  \n**This feature is missing for groups and subgroups.**\n\n\n### Further details\n\nHere are three use cases / reasons for this feature:\n1. Projects can be stared and thus marked as favorite projects. To organize the quick access to groups and subgroups, it would be nice to allow staring (sub-)groups too.  \n   This would also add orthogonality to GitLab.\n\n2. Many projects are split into multiple projects. Thus, the important entry point to work in is not a single project, it's at least a subgroup.\n\n   Example structure:\n   * **Customer project 1**       \u003c= this would be stared\n     * Libs\n       * Library Project 1\n       * Library Project 2\n       * Library Project 3\n     * Main Project\n     * Specification\n     * Documentation\n\n3. This need is strengthened by moving many GitLab core features from project to group level like:\n   - Epics\n   - Group Milestones\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add a button to star a group / subgroup.\n* Add a tab / view to the groups listing to show only stared (sub)groups.\n* Add an entry to the user settings to select \"stared groups\" as dashboard default.\n\nFurther enhancement:\n* Allow pinned (sub-)groups.  \n  (The pinned project feature is currently in discussion.)\n\n#### Images\n\n| Projects (star button) | Projects (starred location) | Groups (button) | Groups (location) |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|  ![Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.57.23_PM](/uploads/91da68bf83703bf9bd07ca043d03d86d/Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.57.23_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.57.55_PM](/uploads/524df09db7bad44f0e965fb36f403025/Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.57.55_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.58.28_PM](/uploads/006cacad1aec26c21ebf713af7e73825/Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.58.28_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.58.15_PM](/uploads/17b93d9f4bdce09fd8b6db3353f3f501/Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_2.58.15_PM.png) |\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\n\n### Links / references\n\nThis could be interesting together with pinned projects.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-06T08:13:00.614Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T14:28:34.497Z","closed_at":"2022-11-21T14:28:34.254Z","closed_by":{"id":11485419,"username":"lohrc","name":"Christina Lohr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11485419/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lohrc"},"labels":["Category:Subgroups","SUS Survey","UX","backend","devops::manage","frontend","group::organization","section::dev","subgroups","type::feature","workflow::problem validation"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We are also not removing related `project_registry` entries when t a project is moved to a different namespace/shard.\n\n### Further details\n\nIf we restrict to the only the cursor, the expensive queries, and we re-use existing database as a final/unique source of truth, we can skip the joins in every other place and just rely on `project_registry`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nHave a flag in `project_registry` to mark a repository as `disabled`, so we know we need to remove from disk, we can restrict counts and the displaying of data by filtering by that flag while delaying removal for an after step.\n\nSo the idea is whenever there is a change in selective sync rules, existing code generates an event (RepositoriesChangedEvent) to re-evaluate existing projects.\n\nThat event will early trigger a mass `UPDATE` in project_registry defining `disabled=true` to any project not matching the new constraints. Doing that early we allow almost 'instant' feedback on our management data (API, Admin UI etc). Then event continue by doing what it currently does (cleanup repositories) plus removing the `project_registry` record after.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWe would be able to simplify queries everywhere that deals with selective sync, by not making the same joins, just relying on existing project_registry.\n\n### Links / references\n\n\ncc @dbalexandre","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-04T00:26:58.503Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T15:57:43.264Z","closed_at":"2019-02-01T17:34:08.774Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","bug::performance","devops::systems","group::geo","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":581391,"iid":23,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.8","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-26T15:15:18.359Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T17:33:19.162Z","due_date":"2019-02-22","start_date":"2019-01-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/23"},"assignees":[{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"}],"author":{"id":2293,"username":"brodock","name":"Gabriel Mazetto","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2293/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brodock"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7109","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":13,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7109","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7109/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/7109/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#7109","relative":"#7109","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#7109"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":576,"epic":{"id":2208,"iid":576,"title":"Geo: Selective Sync Enhancements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/576","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":13218238,"iid":7105,"project_id":278964,"title":"PDFs uploaded to GitLab can't be viewed in browser","description":"### Summary\n\nPDFs across GitLab are are served as downloads rather than opened inline when clicked.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

This information will be displayed in larger type, as it affects billing and instance administration. The columns in this row are:\n- _Seats in license_: Number of seats the license was bought for.\n- _Seats currently in use_: Number of active users.\n- _Max seats used_: Max number of users that existed at any given time.\n- _Users outside of license_: The difference between _Max seats used_ and _Seats in license_.\n\nThe _Validity_ row displays information relating to the license's validity in time:\n- _Start date_\n- _End date_\n- _Uploaded on_\n\nThe _Registration_ row displays who the license holder is:\n- _Licensed to_: Name of the license holder.\n- _Email address_\n- _Company_\n\nIf the user uploads more than one license, the tables for each one can be stacked vertically.

part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44005, we introduced multiple tabs to be able to view varying scopes of subgroups and projects of a given group.\n\nHowever, we're using a GroupsTree Vue component, while having to do a bit of \"dirty\" DOM manipulation to manage multiple instances of said Vue component, while switching tabs and manipulating the page layout (showing search bar in the top area of the page, depending on which tab is selected).\n\nThere's also a tiny bit of technical debt being added on the backend side to support the current implementation, e.g., the multiple routes to determine which tab to load. It would be ideal to handle this completely on the frontend.\n\n### Proposal\n\nConvert group overview tabs to be a single Vue application.\n1. Introduce feature flag so we can manage risk\n1. Perhaps use vue-router or at least use location hashes to denote the different sections,.\n1. Rework any references to \"action\" (as that is now a vuex convention) to be \"active_tab\".\n\n### Links / references\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49687\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44005\n\n### Availability and Testing\n- Adding unit and integration test coverage should suffice, no E2E tests needed at this time.\n- Since a feature flag will be implemented with this change, please be sure to review the `package-and-qa-ff-disabled` and `package-and-qa-ff-enabled` jobs that are triggered automatically on the MR. \n  - Feel free to ping @vburton if you have any questions on QA failures.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-27T13:11:32.997Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T18:48:20.693Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T18:11:07.535Z","closed_by":{"id":5413811,"username":"peterhegman","name":"Peter

For some enterprise customers, we do quarterly and semi-annual true-up reviews. While this is OK for the 1st review, subsequent reviews don't work since they may have lowered their utilization - but we're unable to see it, since Maximum Users (and Users Over License) is still reflecting the high watermark from the previous period.\n\n\u003eUPDATE 2020-12-01: removing the below portion of the original description for future iteration in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290202:\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, there's no timestamp or date info presented, so we don't have a sense of when a customer went over the limit if they owe a true-up.

These standards are usually provided to developers through configuration files that the developer's editor might read and apply. When working in the Web IDE, even if a project has configured this type of file, those settings can't be enforced.\n\n## Additional Details\n\nThe leader in standards for this is [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) which providers a file format for defining coding styles. There is also a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file and adhere to defined styles.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\nThe **Web IDE** should support the following `.editorconfig` settings which align with available methods in the Monaco API.\n\n- `indent_style`: Monaco attribute https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.itextmodelupdateoptions.html#insertspaces\n- `indent_size`: Monaco attribute https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.itextmodelupdateoptions.html#tabsize\n- `end_of_line`: Monaco attribute https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/enums/monaco.editor.endoflinesequence.html\n- `trim_trailing_whitespace`: Monaco attribute https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.itextmodelupdateoptions.html#trimautowhitespace\n- `tab_width`: Monaco attribute https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.languages.formattingoptions.html#tabsize\n- `insert_final_newline`: There is the attribute https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/enums/monaco.editor.editoroption.html#renderfinalnewline, but it's for rendering a final new line, not adding it. Not sure if this is supported.\n\n## Proposal\n\nBased on the comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23352#note_342757032, we are going with a frontend approach for this issue. The comment goes over why that approach would be better than doing it in the backend right now.\n\n### On the frontend\n\n* Whenever the Web IDE is open, fetch the root `.editorconfig` file if it exists.\n* Whenever any directory tree opens, fetch the `.editorconfig` file of that directory and all its parents (if needed).\n* Use [editorconfig-core-js](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-js/) and adapt it to work in a browser environment with the Web IDE. It is basically some code on top of an `.ini` parser and a [minimatch](https://npmjs.org/package/minimatch) utility. \n* Use the above utility to parse the `.editorconfig` files in the current directory and its parents, and determine which properties apply to the the currently open file.\n* Map those properties to Monaco's equivalent names, and apply.\n\n### On the backend\n\nBackend creates a new API, which accepts an array of file paths and returns a JSON containing the contents of those files. It would be very helpful, but the initial POC can be built by sending multiple requests too.\n\n### What's covered and what's not\n\n* We will add support for `.editorconfig` files only. `.gitattribute` files will not be supported in this iteration.\n* The support will be added only to the Web IDE, and not the single file editor or Snippets.\n* Live application of `.editorconfig` settings by means of editing that file in the Web IDE will be supported.\n\n### Concerns\n\n* The library mentioned above is quite dated. If we use it and adapt to use with the Web IDE, maintaining it is in our own hands.\n* It has three dependencies, which we would need to include:\n  * `lru_cache` (Note: this is actually a good thing to include in the Web IDE, and can help us with https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2433.)\n  * `path`\n  * `sigmund` (this is basically just a high performing `deepEquals` function)\n* It _could_ be expensive in terms of performance to parse the properties, but we can't say right now how expensive. The initial POC will not concern itself with performance, but if concerns arise, we will move the processing to a Web Worker.\n* The library would increase the bundle size of the Web IDE quite a bit. Not sure how much yet, but will get to know about this as the POC begins.\n\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-19T18:46:45.427Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T17:21:18.338Z","closed_at":"2020-06-16T03:52:44.183Z","closed_by":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"labels":["Category:Web IDE","Deliverable","devops::create","direction","documentation","frontend","group::editor","type::feature","web edit","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"}],"author":{"id":1187333,"username":"jramsay-gitlab","name":"James Ramsay (ex-GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1187333/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jramsay-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2398164,"username":"himkp","name":"Himanshu Kapoor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2398164/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/himkp"},"user_notes_count":61,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":20,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23352","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/23352","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/23352/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/23352/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#23352","relative":"#23352","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#23352"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":175,"epic":{"id":332,"iid":175,"title":"Customization, .editorconfig and .gitattributes support in the Web IDE","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/175","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12866052,"iid":6961,"project_id":278964,"title":"Show file code owners when viewing a file","description":"A code owners file provides a version controlled way of documenting which groups or individuals are key stakeholders in specific areas of the codebase.

Put a backslash (\"\\\") in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.\n\n- last matching rule has the highest precedence – this means for each file we scan the list top to bottom for every file and users of the last matching rule.\n- rules consist of a pattern and a list of users and groups separated by whitespace\n\n    `\u003cpattern\u003e   \u003cuser\u003e \u003cuser\u003e ...`\n\n- a user is specified with preceding `@` (e.g. `@john`)\n\n### Links / references\n\n- https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/\n\n### Customers\nhttps://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000002xBfL  ","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-19T17:12:20.246Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T13:29:31.357Z","closed_at":"2018-09-06T11:23:22.076Z","closed_by":{"id":87854,"username":"DouweM","name":"Douwe Maan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d1548ae618321220679b3a4fda7fb1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DouweM"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","approvals","backend","devops::create","direction","repository","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":502939,"iid":17,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T17:59:35.838Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:17:11.721Z","due_date":"2018-09-22","start_date":"2018-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/17"},"assignees":[{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},{"id":2003748,"username":"jeethukarthik","name":"Jeethu Karthik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2003748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeethukarthik"}],"author":{"id":1187333,"username":"jramsay-gitlab","name":"James Ramsay (ex-GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1187333/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jramsay-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6961","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6961","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6961/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6961/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6961","relative":"#6961","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6961"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":77,"epic":{"id":143,"iid":77,"title":"Code owners","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/77","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12864344,"iid":6959,"project_id":278964,"title":"Quick action to add/remove issue to epic from issue","description":"### Problem and proposal\n- Right now you can add an issue to an epic, only from the epic itself.\n- This use case is fine when you already have an epic open and you are pasting issues into the epic.

Consider how we would update this going forward (db migration?)\n\nThe UX remains unchanged, just now available as well for default metrics.\n\n![trim-down](/uploads/373cd8be999afa61ab2f0142ffd0c889/trim-down.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-18T21:34:44.649Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:19:30.548Z","closed_at":"2018-09-07T09:10:19.100Z","closed_by":{"id":263716,"username":"grzesiek","name":"Grzegorz Bizon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/263716/avatar.jpeg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/grzesiek"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::monitor","direction","frontend","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":502939,"iid":17,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T17:59:35.838Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:17:11.721Z","due_date":"2018-09-22","start_date":"2018-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/17"},"assignees":[{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},{"id":832471,"username":"psimyn","name":"Simon Knox","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3de75939c39eecd6ea2215ec740a8037?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/psimyn"}],"author":{"id":926632,"username":"joshlambert","name":"Joshua Lambert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0bdc5209b11e9c0953f80234dcb4ffb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/joshlambert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":4,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6948","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6948","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6948/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6948/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6948","relative":"#6948","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6948"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":91,"epic":{"id":160,"iid":91,"title":"SLI Alerts","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/91","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 7, 2018","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12837402,"iid":6946,"project_id":278964,"title":"Design: Allow Container Scanning to scan multiple container images for a single change","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nScan multiple containers in one scan as some changes might impact and introduce security issues in multiple containers. \n\nOnce these reports are available, this is how UX will be affected:\n\n* The same vulnerability type may be found across multiple images.

[ ] Update the fingerprint used by container scanning so that the same vulnerability found in multiple distinct Docker images will not be de-duplicated and will instead be included in the final report, tied to the particualr image it was found in. We'll also need to migrate all existing container scanning vulnerability database entries to use the new fingerprint.  See [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6946#note_308554624) for more details.\n1. [ ] Handle (or simply document) edge cases for handling remediations in a container scan involving multiple Docker images. See [`3. Scanning a mixture of prebuilt and built images with a single Dockerfile`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6946#note_297651771)\n1. [ ] Store the Docker image name for a pipeline in the database to allow the frontend to display a drop down menu enabling the user to filter the vulnerability results for a particular Docker image. In addition to storing the Docker image name in the database, we may need to add a new API call to allow the frontend code to retrieve these values. See [Backend changes required for supporting UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6946#note_309310726) for more details\n1. [ ] Implement the frontend UI changes to allow filtering the vulnerability results for a particular Docker image. \n This will allow a user to filter the list of vulnerabilities to only display those from a single Docker image by selecting the corresponding Docker image name from a sub-menu in the `Report type-\u003eContainer Scanning` drop down menu.\n\n\n#### Product\n\n- ~\"release post item\" - No not hitting the bar of new/novel solution, although it is a user facing improvement.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-18T16:58:31.825Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T13:33:37.167Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T00:53:00.465Z","closed_by":{"id":3913516,"username":"NicoleSchwartz","name":"Nicole Schwartz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3913516/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NicoleSchwartz"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","UX","backend","customer","customer+","devops::secure","direction","feature flag","frontend","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:12.9","quad-planning::complete-no-action","type::feature","workflow::planning breakdown"],"milestone":{"id":991112,"iid":42,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T15:20:39.024Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:55.725Z","due_date":"2020-05-17","start_date":"2020-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},{"id":3614383,"username":"kmann","name":"Kyle Mann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614383/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kmann"}],"author":{"id":1817621,"username":"tpresa","name":"Thiago Presa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1817621/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tpresa"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":90,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6946","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6946","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6946/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6946/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6946","relative":"#6946","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6946"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3139,"epic":{"id":44539,"iid":3139,"title":"Better support scanning of multiple container images","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3139","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12833504,"iid":6944,"project_id":278964,"title":"When you add an issue to an epic that is already in the epic, you get erroneous system notes","description":"In the situation shown by the screenshot below, gitlab-ee#6903 was already part of epic \u0026272.\n\nI pasted the issue link _again_ into the epic, and that generated the two system notes shown below.

As a result, organizations that leverage groups/sub-groups are forced to navigate to individual projects to find the image they are looking for. This results in duplication of efforts or a lack of collaboration on sharing and promoting Docker images amongst teams. \n\n### Proposal\nSimilar to the GitLab Maven Repository, we will allow users to view and pull Docker images/tags at the group level. Users will still build and push images to a given project, but the images will be available for viewing and pulling at the group level. \n\nIn the UI, we will add `Group -\u003e Packages -\u003e Container Registry` below `Group -\u003e Packages -\u003e List` so that users can search, copy image/tag URLs and remove tags. \n\n### Further details\n\n#### User interface\n\n##### Screen capture\n![screen-capture__23_](/uploads/9f38ef359f31e8a8674b59bbff75a4c9/screen-capture__23_.mp4)\n\n##### Screen shots\n![empty_state](/uploads/1235ef29172116a16b23298231fbf657/empty_state.png)\n![collapsed_state](/uploads/7ed2d3e3e6b097c581b3b63fdddf4829/collapsed_state.png)\n![open_state](/uploads/e209a6f5ae9a2d0ab8a066093dec7af6/open_state.png)\n### Intended users\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/research/personas#persona-sasha)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/research/personas#persona-devon)\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- There are no permissions changes needed for this issue.\n\n### Documentation\n- There are no documentation changes needed for this issue. \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n- Success looks like we see increased usage and adoption of the container registry UI.

Burndown charts on the previous milestone then don't accurately reflect what was completed on that given milestone.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n- Include a second chart on the milestone view for `burnup`, which tracks two lines throughout a milestone - `scope` and `completed`. The scope line is variable depending on the amount of scope added or removed to a milestone once it begins. \n- Completed tracks the number of issues `closed` during the given milestone.\n- Include the total count of issues (and weight) added/removed from a given milestone.\n- The scope line is time series like data where it is simply the count of issues in a milestone at a given point in time. Count should be immutable once it is recorded. \n\n![Burnup Chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/9b77c01d96649b5ee784f248b73233bd/Screen_Shot_2019-10-25_at_2.12.14_PM.png)\n\nFollow on iterations:\n\n- See the epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1957\n\n**Important Consideration:**\n\n- This is also happening (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/19445) so the designs should be based on the current Project Milestone view (Example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/30). Once we have this issue and that issue completed, we will revisit the content and overall design of the milestone view.\n- In the coming releases, we will also be working towards segmenting data on milestones by teams/groups so that each team has meaningful insights into their contribution towards a company level milestone. This will include calculating additional derived data such as [velocity and volatility](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/435) as well as providing burndown/burnup charts scoped to [teams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30611) and/or [issue boards](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/6864).  \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n- This presents no suggested deviations from our current security and permissions model. \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- We will want to add documentation around the additional data points now available on Milestones. \n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n- We should write acceptance and unit tests for this.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n#### Success Metrics\n\n- Quantitative:\n  - Milestones and the burndown chart load in two seconds or less.\n- Qualitative: \n  - We make significant progress converting some customers over to using GitLab's Issue Tracking capabilities. \n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The behavior in the proposal is working.\n- [ ] Necessary tests added.\n- [ ] Uses GraphQL first.\n- [ ] Necessary updates to public GraphQL and REST APIs.\n- [ ] Documentation added.\n- [ ] Pajamas first. If major changes are required for the graph, consider contributing to the unified dashboard project.\n- [ ] Milestones load faster than did before making this change.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n- The problems this issue would solve and the corresponding additional data added to a milestone is not something an individual contributor would necessarily care about. According to our [pricing strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers) the likely buyer is Manager and above, so this would fall within the ~\"GitLab Starter\"  tier. \n\n### Links / references\n\n- Directly related open issues are linked below the description.\n\n### Pre-Build Task List\n\n- [x] ~UX / ~\"workflow::solution validation\"  completed\n- [x] ~backend implementation spiked and documented (please consider using a checklist in the description and/or adding a description of the suggested implementation approach)\n- [x] ~\"needs weight\" resolved\n- [x] Prioritize and schedule\n\nOriginal Description:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n- Display distribution of issues `dropped`, `moved`, `closed`, `added`, and `missed` grouped by the `X` axis date.\n  - `dropped` - The issue was removed from the current milestone and not immediately associated to another milestone within a certain period from the time the current milestone was removed.\n  - `moved` - The issue is open and the milestone changed to a different milestone than the one it was currently associated to BEFORE the end of the milestone. \n  - `closed` - The issue was closed while still associated to the milestone. \n  - `added` - The issue was added a day or more after the start date. This is to account for teams that may do planning on the same day they start a milestone.\n  - `missed` - The issue is open and not closed/completed before the end of the milestone. It may be moved after the milestone is done, but it would only be marked as missed. \n\nSomewhere else:\n\n- Display a report of total counts of each event over the duration of the milestone period. (i.e. `dropped`, `moved`, ...)\n- It might also be nice to consider displaying a list of the issue corresponding to each event, but this could also get noisy.\n\n### Background\n- [Burndown charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/burndown_charts.html) as currently implemented, are largely stateless.\n- We will introduce a little more state to account for issues added to a milestone in the middle of a milestone. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6174.\n- But even with that change, burndown charts are mainly stateless. In particular, when you remove an issue from a particular milestone, the burndown chart treats that issue as if it was never part of it.\n- We plan to introduce [burndown charts into boards](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6864). This will allow the scoping of issues to be flexible/customizable based on the board scope/configuration. So instead of bringing scoping to the milestone page (where the burndown chart currently exists), the idea is to bring the burndown chart to the board, which already has a scoping.\n\n### Problems\n- Burndown charts currently do not capture state. In particular:\n  - If in the past, an issue was part of a milestone, but then subsequently removed that milestone, our current implementation doesn't account for it.\n  - If in the past, an issue had a certain label, but then subsequently that label was removed, even our burndown chart in board feature (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6864), will not account for it.\n- This problem above is not a major problem currently. We have not received any requests (per my knowledge) to have those more accurate burndowns. My suspicion is that teams typically use burndowns during a milestone as the issue counts/weights are burning down. After the iteration is over, they do not care and even if the issue is moved to another milestone, that is okay.\n- However, what is a real problem for GitLabbers right now, is the ability to track missed deliverable rates. We have some ongoing work to do this outside of the product. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49201. But eventually we want to solve this inside GitLab. If the burndown chart can account for historical state, then perhaps it can be used to address that particular problem.\n\n### Proposed solution\n- Long-term (we might never need the long-term solution), we entirely use events (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/224, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/48) to build historically accurate burndown charts.\n- In particular, this will solve tracking missed deliverables for GitLabbers. You would look at a burndown chart, and be able to see (given a particular scoping of labels and other attributes), how many issues that were open at the beginning of the milestone, and how many were closed at the end of the milestone. So you can capture the missed deliverable rates immediately from there.\n- In the first iteration, we only use milestone events for historically accurate milestones. This will probably be enough for GitLabbers to track missed deliverables rate, since our team/product area labels are unlikely to change significantly for issues.\n- In the second iteration (which we might not need), we consider label events, and make that accurate.\n- In iterations after that (again, which we might not need), we consider weight events, assignee events, etc.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Solution\nWe are moving forward for now with adding a BurnUp chart to the Milestone view. Users will be able to filter by issues and weights on the two charts at once but they will be viewed side by side as separate metrics. Ideally, they should be side by side in a horizontal row until they reach a min size of 500px. At that point they should stack vertically.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/9b77c01d96649b5ee784f248b73233bd/Screen_Shot_2019-10-25_at_2.12.14_PM.png\n\n### Release Notes\n\nA Milestone's burndown chart is helpful for tracking progress during the course of an Iteration or Sprint, but it doesn't provide insight into how the scope changed during the course of the timebox nor has it previously retained historical accuracy regarding how much of the scope that was committed to at the start of the Milestone was actually completed. To solve these problems and help teams have better insights into scope creep, Milestones now have a Burnup chart that tracks the daily total count and weight of Issues added to and completed within a given Milestone. Burndown charts have also been refactored to use immutable [resource state events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/resource_state_events.html#issues) that further enables Milestone charts to be historically accurate [1] even after you've shifted Issues from one Milestone to the next. \n\n[1] Only applies to Milestones created in 13.4 or higher. \n\n![Image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/d70e65b58a1d2edce837b76dc7bf7abd/Screen_Shot_2020-09-11_at_2.11.53_PM.png)\n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-13T14:08:34.706Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T01:18:50.256Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T01:28:27.100Z","closed_by":{"id":832471,"username":"psimyn","name":"Simon Knox","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3de75939c39eecd6ea2215ec740a8037?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/psimyn"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Team Planning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","GitLab Starter","GitLab Ultimate","Kickoff Highlight","UX","backend","burndown/up charts","devops::plan","direction","documentation","frontend","group::project management","issues","missed-deliverable","missed:12.9","missed:13.0","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","missed:13.3","missed:13.4","planning priority","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233754,"iid":52,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.990Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:12.213Z","due_date":"2020-10-17","start_date":"2020-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/52"},"assignees":[{"id":832471,"username":"psimyn","name":"Simon Knox","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3de75939c39eecd6ea2215ec740a8037?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/psimyn"},{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"}],"author":{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":832471,"username":"psimyn","name":"Simon Knox","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3de75939c39eecd6ea2215ec740a8037?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/psimyn"},"user_notes_count":125,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":25,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6903","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":11,"completed_count":4},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 11 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6903","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6903/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6903/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6903","relative":"#6903","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6903"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1957,"epic":{"id":12766,"iid":1957,"title":"Track scope change within milestone [3]","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1957","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12720837,"iid":6898,"project_id":278964,"title":"Design member counts in GitLab.com billing areas","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen a customer signs up for a GitLab.com plan they'd like to use on a group, they pay for the year and assign their subscription to the group.

The columns in this row are:\n- _Seats in subscription_: Number of seats that have been paid for.\n- _Seats currently in use_: Number of active seats.\n- _Max seats used_: Max number of members there have been in the group at the same time.\n- _Seats owed_: The difference between _Max seats used_ and _Seats in subscription_.\n\nThe _Billing_ row displays information relating to the subscription's validity in time, as well as when payments are due:\n- _Subscription start date_.\n- _Subscription end date_.\n- _Last invoice_: The date the last time the GitLab team (or automatic system) contacted the customer to settle up any outstanding balances.\n- _Next invoice_: The upcoming date when the GitLab team (or automatic system) is scheduled to contact the customer to settle any outstanding balances.\n\n\n#### Seat purchase history\n\nThe seat purchase history will give information on how many new seats were set up per month, as well as when the payment for each batch of seats was made.\n\n![collapsed-table](/uploads/ba21820fca17b523521d947b41682cd0/collapsed-table.png)\n\nThe columns in the table will be:\n- _Month_: Each row will group all the seats that were added during a certain month.\n- _Seats added_: Number of seats added during that month.\n- _Price per seat_: The price of a seat will change depending on the month when it was created, diminishing as the end of the subscription nears.\n- _Paid on_: Date on which the batch of seats was paid.\n\nThere will be one extra row for the original purchase of the subscription, which will be indicated in the _Month_ column.\n\nEach row will have an `Expand` button, which will unfold a nested table detailing which users created the need for new seats.\n\n![expanded-table](/uploads/d35e3b5ba8939665b0366c883b3ffdd3/expanded-table.png)\n\nThe columns in the nested table will be:\n\n- _User_: Profile picture, user name and `@username`\n- _Joined on_: Date on which the user became a member of the group. This attribute will make it possible to determine when the seat was created.\n- _Last activity_: The last time the user had any activity in the group, displayed in _timeago_ format. This will be helpful to determine which users can be removed from the group\n- _Member of_: Members of subgroups count towards billing, so this is an important attribute to help determine where seats are being used.\n\nSince we do not retain information on users once they leave a group, we cannot provide information on which users generated some seats. These will be displayed in a unique row using the following string:\n\n\u003e +X user/users who has/have left the group\n\nWhen there is a large number of seats, the table will serve them in batches of 10 rows. At the bottom of the table there will be a row reading '[Load more users](/uploads/ef3168e83170bcdeec4cbe9f611ccc53/expanded--load-more-users.png)', which will load 10 more rows on click.\n\n#### Sorting\n\nOptionally, a [sorting dropdown](/uploads/5d8d93b91678292b618ac9e7c6fb44d3/sort-dropdown.png) can be included in the nested table. The options would be:\n- _Join date_: Order seats by descending join date.\n- _Last activity_: Order seats by ascending _timeago_ value.\n- _Member of_: Order seats alphabetically by group of membership.\n\n#### Informational popovers\n\n| Seats in use | Max seats used | Seats owed | Last invoice | Next invoice |\n| ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |\n| ![popover__seats-in-use](/uploads/c88d65eec4e8283d022e4d855a896a98/popover__seats-in-use.png) | ![popover__max-seats](/uploads/9ae6001b6e3cfe8dd4b9de69ba60e943/popover__max-seats.png) | ![popover__seats-owed](/uploads/b793f8fb26725104f036dcdc65afba88/popover__seats-owed.png) | ![popover__last-revision](/uploads/33a7aa328a1691a9d8ca8ea971afef84/popover__last-revision.png) | ![popover__next-revision](/uploads/7bf957b2c4ba1674070a408fa0f6ef94/popover__next-revision.png) |\n\nWe will add information icons to some of the cells, which will open popovers when clicked. The copy for each one is as follows:\n\n- _Seats currently in use_:\n\u003e Users with a Guest role don’t count towards seats in use.\n\n- _Max seats used_:\n\u003e This is the maximum number of users that have existed at the same time since this subscription started. This is the minimun number of seats you will need to buy when you renew your subscription.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Learn more about renewals]() (Link TBD)\n\n- _Seats owed_:\n\u003e GitLab allows you to continue using your subscription even if you exceed the number of seats you purchased. You will be required to pay for these seats on your next usage review.\n\u003e \n\u003e [Learn more about invoices]() (Link TBD)\n\n- _Last usage invoice_:\n\u003e This is the last time the GitLab.com team was in contact with you to settle any outstanding balances.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Learn more about invoices]() (Link TBD)\n\n- _Next invoice_:\n\u003e This is the next date when the GitLab.com team is scheduled to get in contact with you to settle any outstanding balances.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Learn more about invoices]() (Link TBD)\n\n#### Trial\n\n![trial](/uploads/38d926152981796cf098ae6734d4b554/trial.png)\n\nWhen a group is on a trial, this will be reflected in the header of the subscription table. The content of the subscription table will behave slightly differently from a normal subscription:\n- _Seats in subscription_: Since a trial is free, this count should increase automatically as users are added to the group. It will always equal _Max seats used_.\n- _Seats owed_: For the same reason, this count will always be `0` for trials.\n- _Last invoice_ and _Next invoice_: Since a trial is free, there are no invoice dates.\n\nThe seat usage table will also behave slightly differently:\n\n- The _Original subscription_ row will be renamed _Trial start_.\n- The price per seat will always be $0.\n- The _Paid on column_ will never have a value.\n\n\n#### Free\n\n![free](/uploads/c68be078cb7a6a612479ad9abb8c1138/free.png)\n\nIf a group is using the free version of GitLab.com, the header for the table will read:\n\n\u003e GitLab.com Free\n\nIn this case, the subscription table will also show some specific behavior:\n- _Seats in subscription_ and _Seats owed_ will behave the same way as they do in a trial.\n- The _Subscription end date_ slot will be empty.\n- Free subscriptions do not have invoice dates.\n\nThe seat purchase history has two peculiarities:\n- The price per seat will always be `$0`.\n- The _Paid on_ column will always be empty.\n\n\n#### Unavailable automatic management\n\nWe currently show a message stating that some groups cannot automatically upgrade or downgrade their subscription. We will restyle this message as an [alert block](/uploads/840bb640259cb072171b0e5fcaa10f7e/unavailable.png) placed between the two tables and change the copy to:\n\n\u003e Automatic downgrade and upgrade is currently not available for some plans. Please contact [Customer Support]() if you wish to make a change.\n\n#### Future\n\nIn the future, we want to add more information about billing, including pipeline minutes usage. We can do this by adding a new row to the subscription table.\n\n![minutes__detail](/uploads/901f4634005bd24acbc7a3e39ee72b5c/minutes__detail.png)\n\nSince we do not allow customers to buy more minutes at the moment, we could start by having the following columns in the _Pipeline minutes_  row:\n- _Monthly minutes_: Number of minutes included in the license.\n- _Minutes used this month_: Number of minutes used in the current month.\n- _Minutes left this month_: Number of minutes left this month.\n- _Average monthly minutes_: Average amount of minutes used each month (excludes the current month). \n\nIn order to include a detailed view of how many minutes are used each month, we can divide the bottom section using tabs.\n\nThe minute usage tab would have the following columns:\n- _Month_\n- _Minutes used_\n- _Minutes unusued_\n\n#### Specs and measures\n\nThe tables have some particular sizing rules that are detailed in these specs:\n\n- [Subscription table](/uploads/5a633fd0c5af7a25cd9a04d1c9b08149/subscription-table-specs.png)\n- [Seat history table](/uploads/0f2df7a529c6edb034a112c6791e2a48/seat-purchase-table-specs.png)\n- [Expanded seat history table](/uploads/bbc93159b46d936f513ba3796ee1ed25/seat-purchase-table-specs__expanded.png). The nested table is offset from its parent by `16px`.\n- [Full interactive spec previews](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/chris/ee%236898__member-counts-billing-areas-spec-previews/)\n- [Sketch file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/master/progress/chris/billing/ee%236898__member-counts-billing-areas.sketch)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* We should be able to clearly explain any overage with the Billing section for the group. \n  * We should consider a Free group on GitLab.com and make sure we're offering them a valuable experience as well.\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-13T00:53:39.434Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:19:47.677Z","closed_at":"2018-10-17T14:27:05.744Z","closed_by":{"id":563185,"username":"cperessini","name":"Chris Peressini","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/563185/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cperessini"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab.com Priority","Manage [DEPRECATED]","customer","devops::manage","direction","gitlab.com","product discovery [DEPRECATED]","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":567670,"iid":19,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.4","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-14T17:31:41.249Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T06:49:55.749Z","due_date":"2018-10-22","start_date":"2018-09-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/19"},"assignees":[{"id":534669,"username":"lbennett","name":"Luke Bennett","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/534669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lbennett"},{"id":563185,"username":"cperessini","name":"Chris Peressini","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/563185/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cperessini"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":534669,"username":"lbennett","name":"Luke Bennett","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/534669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lbennett"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6898","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6898","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6898/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6898/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6898","relative":"#6898","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6898"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":324,"epic":{"id":848,"iid":324,"title":"✨ Redesign billing area for GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/324","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2018","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12715226,"iid":6893,"project_id":278964,"title":"Issue boards with \"Upcoming\" or \"Started\" milestones cannot be retrieved via the API","description":"### Summary\n\nIf you assign the \"Upcoming\" or \"Started\" milestones to an issue board, trying to GET that board via the API results in a 500 internal server error.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

This is currently exploitable on gitlab.com. To reproduce, follow the steps below.\n\n**Victim**\n1. Sign in as a normal user\n2. Create a private group\n3. Grab the group's ID, which can be found in the HTML source on the group page\n\n**Attacker**\n1. Sign in as a new user that can create projects\n2. Create a new group\n3. Create a new project and go to its Settings, expand Merge request settings\n4. Intercept your network traffic\n5.

Now, repeat the request, but this time, replace the `project[approver_group_ids]` with the group ID that was obtained in step 3 of the victim's steps. Since the group IDs are auto incremental, the attacker could enumerate them easily.\n\nTo obtain the information about the group, request the `/api/v4/:namespace%2f:project-name/approvers` endpoint, which will respond with basic details about the group:\n\n**Response**\n```json\n{\n  \"approvers\": [\n    \n  ],\n  \"approver_groups\": [\n    {\n      \"group\": {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"web_url\": \"https://gitlab-instance/:namespace\",\n        \"name\": \"hidden-group\",\n        \"path\": \"hidden-group\",\n        \"description\": \"This may contain confidential information.\",\n        \"visibility\": \"private\",\n        \"lfs_enabled\": true,\n        \"avatar_url\": null,\n        \"request_access_enabled\": false,\n        \"full_name\": \"hidden-group\",\n        \"full_path\": \"hidden-group\",\n        \"parent_id\": null,\n        \"ldap_cn\": \"a\",\n        \"ldap_access\": 10,\n        \"ldap_group_links\": [\n          {\n            \"cn\": \"a\",\n            \"group_access\": 10,\n            \"provider\": \"admin\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"cn\": \"1\",\n            \"group_access\": 50,\n            \"provider\": \"admin\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"approvals_before_merge\": 0,\n  \"reset_approvals_on_push\": true,\n  \"disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request\": null\n}\n```\n\nThis vulnerability can also be exploited by sending a `PUT` request to the GitLab API `/api/v4/projects/:namespace%2f:hidden-name/approvers` endpoint (declared in `ee/lib/api/project_approvals.rb`).\n\n## Impact\n\nInformation of private groups is supposed to remain confidential.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-10T22:03:34.858Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:19:53.974Z","closed_at":"2018-09-10T10:58:45.235Z","closed_by":{"id":87854,"username":"DouweM","name":"Douwe Maan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d1548ae618321220679b3a4fda7fb1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DouweM"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::create","priority::2","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":502939,"iid":17,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T17:59:35.838Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:17:11.721Z","due_date":"2018-09-22","start_date":"2018-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/17"},"assignees":[{"id":1895698,"username":"jritchey","name":"James Ritchey","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1895698/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jritchey"}],"author":{"id":1895698,"username":"jritchey","name":"James Ritchey","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1895698/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jritchey"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1895698,"username":"jritchey","name":"James Ritchey","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1895698/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jritchey"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2018-11-01","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6881","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6881","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6881/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6881/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6881","relative":"#6881","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6881"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12669749,"iid":6878,"project_id":278964,"title":"Select/remove epic from Epic section in sidebar","description":"## Design solution\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/6f8f246d00be7f0ddfbd6e7eaa2582d7/image.png\" heigh=\"800\"\u003e\n\n**Requirements**\nLet's reuse the Milestone dropdown design and interactions for this MVC.\n*  A. User can add the Epic from within the issue, in the sidebar. \n*  B. User is able to click on edit within the Epic area in the sidebar to access the Assign Epic dropdown.\n   * User can click on an Epic to associate it with the issue.\n   * User can click on the checked Epic again to deselect and dissociate it with the issue. They may also select \"No Epic\". This is consistent with the Assign Milestone dropdown.\n   * The dropdown should show epics from this group and from parent groups, the same as the milestone and label dropdowns do.\n*  C. User can type the Epic title to get the Epic returned in their search.\n*  D. User can type the Epic number to get the Epic returned in their search.\n*  E. User can type the Epic link to get the Epic returned in their search.\n*  For MVC, wrap applied Epic titles in the sidebar as we do already.\n\n**Usability Polish**\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/62424c40ae4805720db56f9c5ff75982/image.png\" height=\"150\"\u003e\n\n*  The text falling underneath the icon here doesn't seem like a great experience. Can we prevent this? I added some right padding to the input box to get something more in line with what I would expect (do whatever you feel is best to recreate!):\n\n![Screen_Recording_2019-07-17_at_04.19_PM](/uploads/07bbe7c143bdbf6a4ab9678951d137b2/Screen_Recording_2019-07-17_at_04.19_PM.gif)\n\n*  Long Epic titles can behave the same as long Milestone titles for MVC. I would love if we could truncate after around 25 characters, but that can be stretch. I am expecting this to be something we will need to improve in the next iteration and as we work on the dropdown component.\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/542b63b43fee220b62a9b9d4ab05c707/image.png\" height=\"250\"\u003e\n\n## Archive of @smcgivern 's comments\n- From within an issue.\n- Add an epic to it by selecting one via a dropdown menu.\n- Dropdown menu should have the ability to search and browse epics, or should take an epic number or link\n- Remove the association from the epic by removing it. Click a remove link in the issue sidebar itself.\n- The dropdown should show epics from this group and from parent groups, the same as the milestone and label dropdowns do.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-10T19:55:29.956Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:28:13.516Z","closed_at":"2019-09-23T23:14:19.053Z","closed_by":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich

label","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen a label is 'promoted' to a group label (as opposed to a project label), any board in the projects that used to filter by that specific label loses that filter.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a label, have it assigned to a board and a list, promote it to group label, observe lists on said board.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nLists lose the label filtering.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nLists should keep the label filtering.\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nSystem information\nSystem:\nProxy:
