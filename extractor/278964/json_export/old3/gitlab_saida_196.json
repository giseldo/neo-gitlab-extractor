Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Note about availability\n\nPlease note that this new MR rule will not be available until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331001 is complete.\n\n### Release notes\n\nIf you and your team want to enforce that the code coverage of your project can not decrease from a change you have had to come up with create solutions to check how the coverage changes and fail a pipeline if it decreases. While this was possible within GitLab for teams already used to [Required Approvals](ls/#required-approvals) this creates multiple workflows within the same Merge Request.\n\nNow you can create an approval rule to enforce that code coverage does not decrease as part of a merge request so this workflow follows what the team already does. \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\nAs a team lead , I want MRs that do not keep test coverage at/above the coverage of the target branch to require approval, so we can enforce as a team TDD/Quality/Coverage expectations in the project.\n\nUsers can fail the pipeline today by checking coverage in a separate job and failing the pipeline as shown in this [Unfiltered recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjcUqZu0w5o).\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead) - Wants coverage to be increasing especially in projects with low coverage.\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - doesn't want to have to add bogus tests just to appease the quality gate especially when working on a critical bug fix.\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\nThe user should be able to see that their MR requires approval because the code coverage would decrease the project coverage.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a custom [merge request approval rule](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html) similar to the security `Vulnerability Check` approval rule. This would allow the user to opt their project into the requirement and also allow for an approval to override the block.\n\n* If a project is setup with the MR approval rule when the MR would decrease coverage:\n  * Show the `Merge` button disabled, following the same logic as when required approvals are missing. Users should not be able to interact with the button.\n  * Once the user fixes the code coverage issues in the MR OR there is approval to override, the MR can be merged.\n\n#### ~backend \n\nHere a [POC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59698) of how a potential implementation will look like (need to be updated as it's currently relying on an existing coverage report artifact).\n\nWe will add a **new merge request approval rule for code coverage** and compute the percentage coverage at the pipeline level as described below.\n\n##### First iteration\n\n**No support for jobs with coverage at the project level.**\n\nFor this first iteration of this feature we will only rely on jobs using the [coverage keyword from a gitlab-ci.yml configuration file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#coverage).\n\nThis will allow us to determine easily without ~performance concern which builds we need to fetch the coverage for without dealing with unfinished builds.\n\nWe would need to parse and update the coverage data in our new service for both `base_report` and `head_report`:\n\n1. Fetch builds with a [coverage_regex](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/db/structure.sql?expanded=true\u0026viewer=simple#L10497) - [populated on build creation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/yaml_processor/result.rb#L71).\n2. Update the coverage data for those builds - [builds#update_coverage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/build.rb#L604-607)\n3. Determine pipeline coverage percentage - [pipeline#coverage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb#L635-640)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"UpdateApprovalRulesWorker\"\n  Build1[FetchBuildsWithCoverageRegex] --\u003e Build2[BuildsUpdateCoverage]\n  Build2[PipelineCoverage] --\u003e Build3[GetCoveragePercentage]\nend\n```\n\n\n\n### Further details\n\nFrom the original author: \n\n\u003e This is a really important thing for the coala community (coala-analyzer.org) as well as at least one commercial client of mine who's thinking about switching to gitlab.\n\u003e \n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nN/A\n\n### Documentation\n\n* Add documentation / example for how to setup a coverage Merge Request Rule\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n* Documentation for usage is written\n* Demonstrate turning on/off the approval rule\n* Demonstrate a pipeline passing with coverage that has 0% change or increased coverage.\n* Demonstrate a pipeline failing and blocking the merge because coverage decreases\n* Demonstrate a pipeline failing with a coverage decrease that is overridden\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nThe Team lead is most interested in this feature to enforce team/company norms. As this leverages Merge Request Rules this will be available in ~\"GitLab Premium\" and above.\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo.\n\n### Links /

However, if an image has multiple tags, clicking delete on any of the tags deletes all tags with the same image id. This is due to a limitation with the Docker API, which does not allow for the deletion of a single tag. The issue has been [raised with Docker](https://github.com/docker/distribution/pull/2169), but has not been addressed in over two years. \n\nThis is problematic for users that expect to be able to delete a single tag and end up accidentally deleting multiple tags. Several users have suggested workarounds for this problem, but we have yet to incorporate any of them into the GitLab UI.\n\n#### Example\n\n![image](/uploads/befd42d9c5b6a0fe180ef467368b4539/image.png)\n\nI've clicked 'delete' on line with `Name` = `5ede343b167a188a8349fc7594389c9c725cecab`:\n\n![image](/uploads/a32367c23cc555ca0e215ff0b022a36c/image.png)\n\n### Intended users\n\n- [Software Developer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sasha)\n- [DevOps Engineer](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-devon)\n- [Systems Administrator](https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas#persona-sidney)\n\n### Proposal\nUpdate the container registry UI, to allow users to remove a single tag, without removing all tags with the same `TagID`. \n- Since Docker distribution deletes all tags which point to same image, we can delete just one tag by pushing a different image into it and then deleting the tag.\n- When the tag is the last tag for the image, do not apply the substitution, delete the actual image and not the dummy\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Community Contributions\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21405#note_66291640\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21405#note_144535095\n- https://github.com/glensc/docker-create-tag\n\n\n\n#### UX considerations\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/24705 will give users the ability to select and remove multiple images/tags at once. As part of that change, it's important that only images/tags that are selected are removed. \n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/62559 added a warning modal, which can be removed if we address this issue. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n* Developers, maintainers, and owners will all have the ability to untag multiple images/tags.\n* For the [Container Registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html) we do not allow developers to bulk delete images, but since they are manually selecting the images, we can allow it.\n\n### Documentation\n- [Container Registry user docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/container_registry.html)\n\n### Testing\n- We need to test that the untagging behavior works as expected and that only items selected are removed.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nSuccess looks like we have resolved the core issue and users can begin to rely on the user interface for managing their Container Registry. Once resolved, we should see an increase in the amount of images that are untagged. \n\n#### Metrics\n\n| Priority | Category | Metric | Aggregated by | SMAU Eligible? | Data available? |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| P1 | Container Registry | # of page views of `/container registry`| \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTime: day/week/month/quarter/year \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstance: Self-managed CE/Self-managed EE\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccount type: Core/Starter/Premium/Ultimate\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e | Yes | ? |\n| P1 | Container Registry | # of images/tags deleted one at a time from the UI | \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTime: day/week/month/quarter/year \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstance: Self-managed CE/Self-managed EE\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccount type: Core/Starter/Premium/Ultimate\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e | Yes | ? |\n| P1 | Container Registry | # of images/tags deleted in bulk from the UI| \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTime: day/week/month/quarter/year \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstance: Self-managed CE/Self-managed EE\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccount type: Core/Starter/Premium/Ultimate\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e | Yes | ? |\n\n### Links / references\n- [Multi-select for deleting images](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/24705)\n- [Docker issue for supporting deleting a single tag](https://github.com/docker/distribution/pull/2169)\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-24T21:14:06.381Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T15:22:14.629Z","closed_at":"2019-09-19T09:13:09.126Z","closed_by":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Community challenge","Community contribution","Deliverable","backend","container registry expert","customer","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","maturity::complete","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":4262651,"username":"ggelatti","name":"Giorgenes Gelatti","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4262651/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ggelatti"}],"author":{"id":163557,"username":"glensc","name":"Elan Ruusamäe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00756b6c4989540e24c627c904dd461f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/glensc"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4262651,"username":"ggelatti","name":"Giorgenes Gelatti","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4262651/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ggelatti"},"user_notes_count":81,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":42,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15737","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15737","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15737/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15737/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#15737","relative":"#15737","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#15737"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":434,"epic":{"id":1253,"iid":434,"title":"Lower the cost of the registry by improving storage management","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/434","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":2834377,"iid":928,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group level issue boards","description":"## Resources\nPM @victorwu | UX @cperessini | FE @psimyn  \n\n## Problem\n- Part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/25698 Issue board as a workflow tool\n- Group level issue boards help solve the team-first collaboration problem: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1295, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/27728\n\n## Design\n- In the group navigation, you have a new tab under issues called `Boards`.

No users can be added, no roles can be changed. \r\n\r\n**Gotcha 1:** If an owner member disabled group links temporarily, they can add a non-LDAP user at any role. Then, re-add the LDAP group link. LDAP user roles and memberships will be managed as usual. However, the non-LDAP user will remain a member of the group.\r\n\r\n**Gotcha 2:** An owner member can remove the LDAP group link and not re-add it. Then, owner members can add, remove or update member permissions at will.\r\n\r\n## Why we're discussing this\r\n\r\ngitlab-org/gitlab-ee#343 plans to introduce LDAP overrides (which was a pre-8.0 feature). This has been a heated topic. We changed the behavior in 8.0 at the request of many vocal users. Now, we've seen the opposite effect - users that relied on this behavior prior to 8.0 want the overrides back. \r\n\r\nWhat we realize based on the current situation outlined above is that it's really not all that restricted. The two gotchas show two ways in which group Owners can still manage membership manually. We **will** introduce the override feature as planned in gitlab-org/gitlab-ee#343 because it does not substantially change the security model, but now we must decide what we will do (if anything) to change further restrict the model. We can optionally ship any change that comes out of this issue in connection with gitlab-org/gitlab-ee#343 so things are more secure.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Restrict group owners from managing LDAP group links\r\n* Restrict group owners from managing LDAP member overrides\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n1. Do nothing. GitLab administrators who want to totally restrict group membership to LDAP can make themselves the sole owner(s) of every group. Then, only they can enact overrides or remove/change LDAP group links. \r\n2. Don't add a global config option but create a rake task to demote all owners and make GitLab administrators owners. (This is a less direct way to implement item 3).\r\n3. Add a global configuration option to only allow GitLab administrators to be owners of groups. This will not be retroactive so we will also have to create a Rake task or similar to demote all current group owners to masters and add GitLab administrators as group owners.\r\n4. **SSOT: Add a global configuration option to restrict group owners from managing LDAP group links.

We can consider that when this is being implemented.\n\n## Implementation - very rough\n\n- make sure a `+` is the right character to use\n- update reference regular expressions to recognize the new character\n- find where we handle adding `(closed)` or `(merged)` to link titles, and add the title if the `+` character has been used\n- only remove the tooltip if the tooltip only displays the title.

This is problematic; this approach gives individual tokens too much power. A single `api` token applies to all projects on the instance, and we should limit the blast radius for individual tokens by allowing them to be scoped.\n\nIn this issue, we'll limit PATs to specific projects. PATs will still be attached to a particular user. This'll allow for use cases like a large organization with hundreds of projects designating a single bot user, and creating individual PATs for each of their projects. This increases security considerably, and allows us to limit misuse of an `api`-scoped token to a specific project.\n\nAfter this issue is complete, we'll continue to iterate with improvements like [limiting PATs to groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/45967) and [limiting the functional scope](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41165) of the `api` token.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the ability to limit API access by personal access tokens to specific projects when creating a token.\n\nThis issue should cover the backend changes only. After this iteration, GitLab should be able to generate a PAT scoped to a single project that we'll use for Task Bots in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2587.\n\n### Details from Imre (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15666#note_326095869)\n\nI was considering creating a new `project` scope that requires an additional value which could be stored in a separate table as mapping between `PersonalAccessTokens` and `Projects`. Then extend `APIGuard` to be able to use it, and finally make some of our API endpoints accessible with this new scope.\n\n### OP by @doits \n\nI have a bot you does some code analysis (with https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto). This bot has access to Gitlab with a special user (and to each project with reporter rights) and is only run on CI. But to access the API, it uses a Gitlab access token which is stored in a secure variable. This is good so far, but a malicious developer could still output this access token by changing the tests and then do what he wants with it, e.g. seeing/accessing all projects the bot has access to (most of them are private).\n\n1. This can be mitigated by restricting an access token to specific projects/groups. I would create different access tokens for different projects for that bot user, so when a malicious developer extracts it, he only has access to that specific project he sees the builds to (which means he has access to it anyway in my case).\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-17T09:48:41.411Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T21:05:08.880Z","closed_at":"2022-04-18T23:05:38.860Z","closed_by":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","FY23:ROADMAP","GitLab Core","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","api","automations","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","frequently duplicated","group::authentication and authorization","internal customer","missed:12.10","missed:13.1","missed:13.2","missed:13.3","missed:13.4","permissions","personal access tokens","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It's not always wanted that any developer could change this.\n\n## Proposal\n\nBy implementing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/14376, we make it so that the `.gitlab-ci.yml` can be pointed to in a different repo. In this way, the configuration can reference a file in another project with a completely different set of permissions. The file should be publicly accessible, but can be editable only by users in the other project.\n\nThis issue then becomes a documentation issue, describing how to solve this problem using the solution provided in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/14376.\n\n### Original Proposal\n\nOriginally we discussed using the [code owners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html) feature, by using the  \"Require code owner approval\" toggle available in gitlab-ce~2278657. The idea was that as long as the `CODEOWNERS` file itself is locked down with a code owner and the `Require code owner approval` is checked then this is can already be accomplished. \n\nWe realized, though, that `CODEOWNERS` is not sufficient as-is today to solve this problem because users can still push changes to `.gitlab-ci.yml` and have pipelines for merge request to run with the changed `.gitlab-ci.yml`. What would needed is to block changes from reaching the remote branch or at least to drop a pipeline immediately if unauthorized changes are made to a `.gitlab-ci.yml`.\n\nGiven this, the new proposal is simpler and as effective in achieving the same thing.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-11T13:43:37.854Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T07:21:28.253Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T12:42:03.633Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","auto updated","customer","devops::verify","direction","documentation","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:12.5","permissions","pipeline","popular proposal","potential proposal","security","settings","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891797,"iid":40,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.539Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:13.329Z","due_date":"2019-12-17","start_date":"2019-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":657798,"username":"gsmetal","name":"Sergey Gnuskov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5d1c1c3ace72ec58ec9f1f8160d19ee?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gsmetal"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":120,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":155,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15632","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":0,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15632","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15632/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15632/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#15632","relative":"#15632","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#15632"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1856,"epic":{"id":11783,"iid":1856,"title":"Evidence collection for Releases MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1856","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24642313,"iid":15626,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow LDAP to be enabled but not display on the sign in page","description":"Zendesk: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/33444\n\nA common use-case is to use SAML and LDAP together.

For example:\n\n- Step 1, define which roles/groups/users are allowed to push\n\n![image](/uploads/e09e4a7ec359cb2310949ed78803249a/image.png)\n\n- Step 2, once roles/groups/users have been defined as allowed to push, \"allow force push\" option shows next to each item on the list\n\n![image](/uploads/64a9916d54f5b03de33802613800cd33/image.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n---\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003ePrevious proposal 1\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAdd a new setting on protected branches called 'Allowed to Force Push' which would enable maintaners/owners to define which user/groups have this elevated privilege.\n\n![image](/uploads/cf143731ce756c138c4b2962d576ff48/image.png)\n\n- Add field `Allowed to force push` to the Protect a branch form\n- Add field `Allowed to force push` to the list of protected branches\n- Fields should behave as follows:\n  - Field should be defaulted to `No one`\n  - Clicking the field should open a dropdown selection\n    - Dropdown should allow the user to select one or more roles (or No one)\n    - Dropdown should allow the user to select one or more groups\n    - Dropdown should allow the user to select one or more users\n    - Dropdown should allow the user to search users\n    - Selecting an option should mark the option as selected and update input field\n    - Clicking an already selected option should unselect it \n    - Selecting `No one` should remove other role selections\n    - If `No one` is selected, clicking should `not` remove selection\n  - Clicking outside the dropdown should close it\n  - Input should display selections\n    - If a single role is displayed, display the role\n    - If more than 1 role is selected display N roles\n    - If one or more groups are selected, display N groups\n    - If one or more users are selected, display N users\n    - If a combination of roles, groups, and/or user are selected display N users, N groups, N roles\n- Protected branches should allow roles, groups, and users to perform a force push according to the selections made\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Customers:\n\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000006g0e6\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001F4xr9\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000002xBfL\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100000fdsC1\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001C37c6\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001QRxpH\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000004bZPD\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001gSoye\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001Eo6KV\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001crSyM\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0016100001fOgW0\n* https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00161000002xBaT\n\n### Links\n\nThis was originally proposed in gitlab-ce#20550\n\n### Use cases\n\n1. Doing a revert of code on the master branch and the getting develop branch back in sync with master, this is currently done via a force push. Ideally this would be done by automation when the scenario happens and a service account would have this access.\n1. Small teams (ie agencies) where owners want to quickly resolve conflicts themselves and they are the only maintainers on the project.\n1. Situations where a mistake (ie wrong git command) wreaked havoc and cost the teams hours to resolve. During postmortem agreed that force push should have been used to recover and analysis taken place later. Maintaner was not available until after the incident was resolved and the time was lost.\n1. Multiple branches must be synched with master. A lot of these are experimental and have a dedicated owner, currently, owners must unprotected, force push to sync with master, and then re-protect. The setting here would save time.\n1. Training using GitLab pages. Students use a pre-created branch, experiment with changes. When the next class is ready, I'd like to sync other branches with master by force pushing.\n1. Corrupted git repo. There is a missing tree, which can be fixed by force push to the previous commit and trying again. There are other ways to fix this, but this is the fastest an when pressed for time is a good option to consider. Especially helpful when maintainer is not availble to change repo settings but dev leads with \"developer\" role could do this.\n1. Use of protected master to deploy to production, and we want some members to be able to force push master to point to the head of the staging branch\n1. Org where all branches are protected but all WIP branches (using pattern on branch name `WIP-*`) allow force push.","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-09T16:15:23.892Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T18:49:23.609Z","closed_at":"2021-04-01T08:19:07.952Z","closed_by":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"labels":["Deliverable","GitLab Core","Open Source","SCM QoL","Technical Writing","backend","backend-weight::2","customer","devops::create","direction","documentation","frontend","frontend-weight::2","group::source code","missed-deliverable","missed:13.9","movingtogitlab","repository","section::dev","tw::finished","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},{"id":2819375,"username":"jerasmus","name":"Jacques Erasmus","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2819375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jerasmus"},{"id":5353011,"username":"TaehyeokKang","name":"Mycroft Kang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5353011/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/TaehyeokKang"}],"author":{"id":647763,"username":"eclipsecreative","name":"Eclipse Creative","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ebbbb53a53964d4ecafb90b3ae4f337a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eclipsecreative"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":179,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":175,"downvotes":2,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15611","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15611","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15611/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/15611/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#15611","relative":"#15611","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#15611"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":522,"epic":{"id":1832,"iid":522,"title":"Improve protected branches","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/522","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24642192,"iid":15595,"project_id":278964,"title":"Granted user notification show the last acces level not the new one","description":"GitLab 8.10.4\nGitLab Shell 3.2.1\nGitLab API v3\nGit 2.7.4\nRuby 2.1.8p440\nRails 4.2.7\nPostgreSQL 9.2.17\n\nWhen I granted access to user, the notification message show the last access level, not the new one.\n\nDid few tests.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n- In the `Create release` page (/-/releases/new), user sees a checkbox for adding the message of an annotated tag to the release notes.\n- Checking the checkbox will add the information to the release notes. The content won't be displayed in the `Write` view of the release notes box, but the user can preview the changes by clicking the `Preview` tab.\n  - Unchecking the checkbox should remove the information from the release notes.\n- Clicking the `Create release` button will create a new release. \n- The user is taken to the Releases page (/-/releases) where the annotated tag comment will be displayed under a new header `Tag message`.\n- Clicking the `Edit release` button takes the user to the edit view of a given release. \n   - The checkbox should not be displayed on the page anymore.\n   - Instead, the `Tag message` is displayed as markdown in the release notes. The user can edit the content freely as plain text.\n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. --\u003e\n\nIn our projects, we use a tag's annotation to provide release information like a changelog for that version.\n\nThe tag page of GitLab visualizes this message as plain text, even without line breaks. When clicking on a tag, the message has a simple, but quite nice formatting. Currently we need to create the release notes manually to get a nice formatting also on the tag list page. Unfortunately, this leads to duplicated content in a tag's detail page.\n\nIf tag's message is available, the release notes field will be pre-populate with the tag's message by default. The user will be able to edit, or remove this message, add their notes, and so on.\n\nIn the future, we could consider annotating the start and end message like this example:\n\n```\n\u003c!-- tag message begin --\u003e\nThis is the annotated tag's message.\n\u003c!-- tag message end --\u003e\n```\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\nFollow same permission model for [Releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#edit-a-release). Only users with at least the Developer role can edit releases.\n\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [x] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

This is particular important for manual actions such as `deploy to production`, but could apply to automatic actions as well. This is similar, but slightly different than protected branches. Depending on how protected branches evolves, protecting environments may not be necessary. Or vice versa.\n\n## Proposal\n\n* Use an interface similar to protected branches\n\nUser should be able to:\n1. Determine at a glance if an environment is protected or not\n2. Once you drill down into the environment, see who has permission to deploy to this environment\n3. If user has the proper role/access, protect/unprotect and environment\n4.

As deploy jobs could be raised by different users with different roles, it is very important that specific environments are \"protected\" to avoid unauthorized people to affect them. This feature ensures that only people with the right privileges can deploy code to the \"protected\" environments, keeping them safe.\n\n### Permissions (without protection)\n\nBy default, `developer`, `maintainer`, and `owner` role are able to deploy to environment as they can run CI/CD pipeline jobs.\n\n|  | Guest | Reporter | Developer | Maintainer | Owner |\n|---|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| List environments |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| View environment |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Edit environment |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n| Delete/close environment |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n| See deploy board |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| See pod logs |  |  | Y | Y | Y |\n| See metrics |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Configure metrics \u0026 alerts |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n| Terminal |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Deploy to environment |  |  | Y | Y| Y |\n\n### Permissions (with protection)\n\nWhen protected, `maintainer` and `owner` will be able to deploy to environment, although that is configurable.\n\n|  | Guest | Reporter | Developer | Maintainer | Owner |\n|---|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| List environments |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| View environment |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Edit environment |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n| Delete/close environment |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n| See deploy board |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| See pod logs |  |  | Y | Y | Y |\n| See metrics |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Configure metrics \u0026 alerts |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n| Terminal |  |  |  | Y | Y |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Deploy to environment |  |  |  | Y* | Y* |\n\n\\* default permissions is configurable and can be removed if desired\n\n### UX Proposal\n\n#### Project settings\nWithin project CI/CD settings, we'll include another section for Protect Environments settings. This will allow users to choose an environment to protect. An environment can be protected by selecting `Maintainers`, an individual user(s), or a group(s) that is shared with the project.

Many of these images are only needed for a short time. There isn't a good way for developers to delete these images, so they frequently don't. This results in either ballooning storage costs, or the Admin trying to remove images manually via the [Container Registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#delete-repository-tags-in-bulk), which is error prone and inefficient. \n\n#### User stories\n- I as a systems administrator, need to ensure that my development teams are expiring unused images, so that I can run garbage collection, delete them from storage and lower the cost of storage. \n- I as a developer, need the ability to adjust my project's and Docker repositories' expiration policy, so that I can ensure that my important images (ones required for a given release) are not accidentally removed.  \n\n### Intended users\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Goals\n- Our self-managed customers can set (and forget) a reasonable expiration policy that is enforced by default for every new project in their organization. \n- GitLab.com enforces expiration policies on all new projects, so that more images are eligible for garbage collection, so that we can, once [online garbage collection is available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/26818), greatly reduce the cost of storage for the gitlab.com Container Registry. \n\n### Proposal\n\n#### MVC\nIntroduce a new user interface that will allow project owners to view and update tag expiration policies for all new projects. \n- Project owners may enable / disable the feature at the project level in Project--\u003e Settings --\u003e CI/CD --\u003e Tag Expiration Policies\n- Allow project owners to update the default policy at the project level for all Docker repositories in the project:\n  - Expiration interval\n  - Expiration schedule\n  - Retain at least `n` tags\n  - Expire tags matching the name (regex allowed)\n\n##### User Interface (These designs are still in motion and are subject to change)\n\nCI/CD Settings --\u003e Docker Tag Expiration Policies\n![docker_expiration_policy](/uploads/3afbdf9cf0e52b9b0755707d1752c931/docker_expiration_policy.png)\n\nDocker Repository view (not included in this issue)\n![image](/uploads/f9b1522cacc30947aac7ace9b4e3d0c5/image.png)\n\n#### What we are not doing in the MVC\n- It's important to note that this issue does not include tag retention policies. This is the because we are building this feature using the existing GitLab bulk delete API, which does not specify which tags to keep. We will do this, but it won't be included in the MVC. \n- The MVC will not include policies at the Docker repository level, that will be done with: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37242\n\n##### Future Plans (beyond the MVC)\n\n###### Expiration Policies\n1. [Leverage Docker tag expiration policies at repository level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37242)\n1. [Use the GitLab API to define protected images to prevent them from being deleted during garbage collection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/27072)\n1.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe Package stage allows you to publish, consume, and discover images, all in one place. Users publish and pull images using GitLab CI/CD, the command line, or the GitLab API. \n\nAs organizations add more tags to an image repository, it can be difficult to find a specific tag. This is especially true when pagination is introduced.\n\n### Intended users\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n\n### User experience goal\n\nImprove the experience of finding a specific tag or tags by introducing an intuitive way to sort the list of tags by a variety of properties.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a sort UI component to the Image Repository Detail View so users can sort the list of items by tag name. \n\n| Image repository list view w/ sort |\n|---|\n| ![Image_detail](/uploads/aacf0021b6ee00b5d44a500e261c80ce/Image_detail.png) |\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nAll users of the container registry would benefit, but larger enterprise customers will appreciate these changes more.\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming

Show an additionl field for \"source repo\" (we could use the same pattern we use for new merge requests on forks):\n\n![image](/uploads/676b14f187b79a288040c9498036578e/image.png)\n\n## Further info\n\nHere is an example of such a Compare view on github - https://github.com/ellekasai/resumecards/compare/gh-pages...weitzman:master","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-07-13T15:46:54.159Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T18:11:16.420Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T11:25:59.829Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Deliverable","Dogfooding","GitLab Core","UX","backend","backend-weight::3","devops::create","direction","forking","frontend","frontend-weight::5","group::source code","missed-deliverable","missed:13.9","repository","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233761,"iid":57,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.646Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:00.171Z","due_date":"2021-03-17","start_date":"2021-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},{"id":3993566,"username":"sming-gitlab","name":"Samantha Ming","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3993566/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sming-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":616229,"username":"weitzman","name":"Moshe Weitzman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ece255bf6866464c79a8e9844c6eb3b4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/weitzman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":18,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14615","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14615","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14615/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14615/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#14615","relative":"#14615","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#14615"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1421,"epic":{"id":8068,"iid":1421,"title":"⑂ Forking Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1421","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e day remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":3787035,"iid":1439,"project_id":278964,"title":"Auditor user with read-only access","description":"### Resources \r\nFE/BE @timothyandrew | UX @cperessini \r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* As a system admin, create a user in a special role called `Auditor`.\r\n* The user has read access to all projects and groups, and all the components therein (issues, merge requests, etc.).

The scope of this issue is to design and implement one or several solutions to address these problems:\n* As a code reviewer and merge request approver:\n * I want to know how many merge requests need my review and approval, or at least get a sense of how many.\n * I want to know which merge requests need my review and approval, and be able to navigate to any specific one quickly.\n * I want to know other people who can approve a merge request (and those that have already done so), so that I can nudge them if I don't have time to do it myself.\n * I want to which merge requests are high priority, or deserve my attention. For example, if there's one merge request that needs one more approval, and I'm the only person left who is allowed to approve it, it is currently blocked by my inaction. So I should probably review it and approve it soon. Or suppose a particular feature is deemed high priority, then I should probably review that one first. If many folks are eligible to reviewed a merge request, then that merge request should be lower in priority for me.\n  * Stretch goal: I want to know exactly which merge request I should work on next.\n* As an engineering manager / engineering lead:\n  * I want to know which merge requests are done code review and have all required approvals, and are ready for merging in.\n  * I want to know which merge requests are close to be done for code review and approval, and which ones still need a lot more work.\n  * I want to know which team members can approve a merge request, so I can nudge them with a reminder.\n  * I want to know which team members have already approved a merge request, so that I don't have to bother them, or that I can thank them.\n  * Stretch goal: I want to know exactly which next merge request deserves my attention.\n\n### Product and design considerations\n* The stretch goals are harder to solve, and likely can be managed manually be a team. The workflows may be very specific to teams. So it's not a good idea to focus on these problems in the initial designs and implementations. (But if a proposed design can solve them too, then that is great.)\n* We should design for the scenario of a small number of required approvals per merge request. Designing for a scenario for say, 100 approvals required is unrealistic in most cases, and outside the scope for this particular issue. Furthermore, it may be typical for a person to be requested as an approver of 20 to 30 open merge requests, in a large organization.\n* The designs should be consistent with the design of the view in a single merge request (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1262). (Or we should at least harmonize them in future work.)\n* We should consider the already many proposals outlined that suggest including more information in each entry of the merge requests list view, and also expanding the filtering/search functionality (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/765, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1106, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/52, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1177, and the comment thread in this issue).\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/52 already has a design and merge request (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/620). We should try to reuse as much as possible.","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-07-12T11:33:38.354Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T17:03:39.742Z","closed_at":"2018-01-23T19:32:32.939Z","closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","UX","approvals","customer","customer success","devops::plan","frontend","priority::3","severity::3","type::feature"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5497,"username":"JobV","name":"Job van der Voort","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07e1e9ffdda52d8c519ac5c49929d7dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JobV"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":30,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/769","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/769","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/769/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/769/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#769","relative":"#769","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#769"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24330327,"iid":14588,"project_id":278964,"title":"Issue and MR activity in feed order (newest first)","description":"## Description including problem, use cases, benefits, and/or goals\n\nI'd like to be able to view comments, references and other activities in issues and MRs in a feed order, similar to the Activitiy view, with the newest activity at the top.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI can imagine a drop down to the very right of the award buttons, with two options: \"Oldest first\" (current behaviour) and \"Newest first\" (feed behaviour).

This endpoint later can be used for [spliting the gigantic environments.json endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368680) as further optimization.\n- [Conversation here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15419#note_1053914198).\n\n| Single Tag | Multi-Tag |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![One_Tag](/uploads/0dba60ac28a70df9130fa81a505b8691/One_Tag.png) | ![Multiple_Tags](/uploads/52b67e318fb47207a47f86fcfaf54791/Multiple_Tags.png) |\n\n**Backend Notes about mapping the UI components and endpoints:**\n\n* [Environments Index Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/environments)\n  * JSON Endpoint: `environments.json`\n  * It returns the high-level overview of project environments.\n* Deployment Details (A new endpoint for this issue)\n  * JSON Endpoint: `deployments/:id.json`\n  * It returns the details of a specific deployment, including related tags `tag_names_contains`.\n  * Usage example: Frontend queries to this endpoint when a user expands the deployment details in Environment Index page.\n\n- Note: If we add a new endpoint, we'd go for GraphQL instead of internal Rest API. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367410#note_1056103445. In this case, the endpoint path will be `/graphql`, but this mapping is still same.\n\n[More context in this conversation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15419#note_1056783493).\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions?

This is almost guaranteed to be wrong, sometimes wildly so. If a developer wants more accurate coverage number, they have to [jump through a bunch of hoops](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5018). I don't know how to solve this generally. \n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer) - who wants to know from a glance at the pipeline widget on the MR page, jobs page or pipeline page how coverage has changed without having to download a report or visit another tool\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead) - Who wants the project coverage badge to be an accurate reflection of coverage for the entire project.\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

We may consider showing how the coverage diff from each job has changed but that may be a stretch.\n\nSee the Designs below.\n\n### Proposal options considered\n\nSome options we have considered:\n\n1. Leave as-is\n1. Use only the first (or last) coverage number generated in the pipeline\n1. Tell people to manage their own coverage numbers and report a single, overall number.\n1. Document how to report a single, overall number for some set of languages/frameworks.\n1. Parse from various coverage reporters that know how to merge separate reports into a final number.\n\nHow we will proceed: Leave the calculated value as is and add some context from the known jobs that make up the value.\nWhy: None of the options considered are great ones nor meet everyone's needs and there is a distinct possibility we make things worse by changing the current method. Instead we believe that calling out when a coverage value has multiple inputs and providing the context about those inputs is the best option for users. To do this there are some changes coming in other issues:\n\n* [Custom text for coverage badges](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17555) will allow for a better view of coverage numbers on the project view\n* [Graphing code coverage over time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33743) will allow a view of how the coverage value from each job is changing over time\n\nOther enhancements for integration with code coverage reports will be coming in the epic [Make code coverage more comprehensive](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/100) that we believe will further help add context to code coverage data for users.\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIf this is successful more users will include code coverage calculations in their build jobs. We will calculate how many jobs include coverage data and think that within 90 days of shipping this and the other 2 issues mentioned in the proposal customer jobs with coverage reports will increase by 10%.\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly.

Yes, this is a little less concise than not having the keyword, but it makes the intention very clear.\n- More complex scenarios can still use child/parent pipelines, so we don't have to design this as a all inclusive matrix build specification language.\n\nAdditionally, a simpler matrix is also supported for when each entry from the first dimension contains all items from the second:\n\n```yaml\ndeploystacks:\n  stage: deploy\n  parallel:\n    matrix:\n      - PROVIDER: [aws, ovh, gcp]\n        STACK: [monitoring, app1, app2]\n```\n\nThis version would generate:\n\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=aws; STACK=monitoring)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=aws; STACK=app1)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=aws; STACK=app2)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=ovh; STACK=monitoring)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=ovh; STACK=app1)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=ovh; STACK=app2)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=gcp; STACK=monitoring)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=gcp; STACK=app1)`\n1. `deploystacks (PROVIDER=gcp; STACK=app2)`\n\n### Limitations\n\n- For the MVC total jobs will be limited to the same number as `parallel` (currently 50: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#parallel)\n- There is no such thing as a variable containing an array in GitLab today, so setting up a matrix as follows is not possible:\n\n```yaml\n  parallel:\n    matrix:\n      - PROVIDER: ${MY_PROVIDERS}\n        STACK: ${MY_STACKS}\n```\n\nInstead of this, for now to avoid repitition you should use `extends`:\n\n```yaml\n.matrix\n  parallel:\n    matrix:\n      - PROVIDER: [aws, ovh, gcp]\n        STACK: [monitoring, app1, app2]\n\nbuild:\n  extends: .matrix\n\ntest:\n  extends: .matrix\n\ndeploy:\n  extends: .matrix\n```\n\n### External examples\n\nExample of `.travis.yml`\n\n```yaml\nrvm:\n  - 1.9.3\n  - 2.0.0\n  - 2.2\n  - ruby-head\n  - jruby\n  - rbx-2\n  - ree\ngemfile:\n  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x\n  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x\n  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.1.x\n  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-edge\nenv:\n  - ISOLATED=true\n  - ISOLATED=false\n```\n\nThis produces 56 individual jobs.\n\nReal life example provided by @MrChrisW:\n\n* https://gitlab.com/MrChrisW/cookiecutter-pylibrary/blob/master/.travis.yml\n* https://gitlab.com/MrChrisW/cookiecutter-pylibrary/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nTravis docs: [Build matrix](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#build-matrix)\n\nAlso, GitHub CI/CD is planning the same feature: https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy\n\n### Related Links\n\nRelated issues https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/13755, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19198\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

On any branch of your fork, you'll now see how many commits it is behind and/or ahead of the upstream project's main branch. You find this information on the project main page as well as under **Repository \u003e Files**. In a [second iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330243), we intend to enable updating your fork's branch from the UI. Any feedback on that issue is welcome.\n\n![How_far_is_your_fork_behind_ahead_of_the_upstream_project](/uploads/8c5495d7b8b6fc27f6fc88252e55fccd/How_far_is_your_fork_behind_ahead_of_the_upstream_project.png)\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nLooking at a forked project in GitLab, there is no way to tell how far ahead or behind it is from the upstream project.\n\n### Proposal\n\nNeed way to show whether or not the origin fork master is in sync with the upstream master. Github currently shows the synchronization status at the top of each branch: (https://github.com/ahocevar/ol3). Would be nice to at least know if the upstream branch is ahead of the origin.\n\n### Information to display\n\n1. Ahead\n    - This branch is {#} commits ahead\n2. Behind\n    - This branch is {#} commits behind\n3. Up to date\n    - This branch is up to date\n\nLooking at the display, here is a comparison of current versus design with fork widget.\n\n| Current | Fork branch status |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|  ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/98f34ca2b0f3c335e697ba2f65cac4b2/image.png)      | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/c2219ac84e4d5e43d9db0292cbc14a6d/image.png)       |\n\n#### States\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/1a686dd2dde434141f5bf37a47a784c2/image.png)\n\nDiverged state pending discussion https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14491#note_1167417913\n\n### Changes from current view\n\n- Added icon of a fork\n- Added description about branch status of commits relative to upstream\n- Boxed information to match the last commit box\n    - In a future iteration we may update this styling but for this change we can reduce scope by focusing on the fork widget.\n- Move the fork widget below the branch selector\n\n### Why move the fork widget below the branch selector?\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/8a3f4607463a1c802fe59dceb82327e9/image.png)\n\nShowing where a forked repository is behind/ahead the upstream repository is relative to the branch of the fork. The dropdown of the branch selector drives the information of whether it is behind/ahead the upstream repository.\n\n\n\u003e Additionally, a re-base or synchronize button on the origin/master fork would improve the user experience significantly, versus have to do a pull and push to re-synchronize the origin.\n\nAdding actions to synchronize will be handled in this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330243+\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\nExisting tests might require to be updated to incorporate the feature.

How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n#### Potential follow up problem/need statements\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n- **The user**

alignment with existing drag and drop patterns as defined in Pajamas: https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/interaction There should be clear signifiers surrounding:\n* That the item is draggable (shown here by the drag icon)\n* That the item is being dragged and where it's coming from (shown above by the \"ghosted\" or semi-transparent view of where the checklist item previously displayed)\n* What else is affected and how once the item has been dropped (shown here by an animation of movement and the placement shift of the two items)\n* The \"received\" version of the view should mimic drag and drop functionality in boards in that there is a ghosted version of the item that appears where the user hovers while holding the element to show how the other related items will move and where the item will be dropped (see video below)

This has a couple of use cases:\n* Reduces operational burden for instances that err on the side of security and have registration disabled, but want to conditionally allow sign-up for certain members of the organization.\n* Enables an EE instance to better control seat utilization. If managing costs is important to an instance, this may be helpful to gate membership on an instance.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add an instance-level setting requiring admin approval for new users.\n   * New users who attempt to register a new user on an enabled instance should see a message informing them that an admin must first approve their registration.\n   * Present an error to the user if they attempt to recover their password or login before they are approved. \n* For the first iteration, no UI: \n   * Each request should send a registration request to instance administrators. The email should have the user's name, username, and email, with a link to approve or disapprove the request.\n   * Send a notification email to the user when the request has been approved. We can also mark their email as confirmed.\n   * User that requested approval are placed in a new state \"blocked_pending_approval\" that functionally blocks the user and doesn't count them against licensing. Having a new state will be useful when building an approval queue in the future.\n\n### OP\n\nI would like to have the ability to restrict new users coming in from local sign up. For now, if you allow sign up in GitLab, users which register there have an account directly with default access rights. It is already possible to restrict users coming from omniauth providers, but it would be great to restrict users coming from local sign up as well. In our environment, we accept users coming in via Shibboleth directly as users with default access rights and users coming in via Github are marked as external.

But it is not recorded who made an edit and most of all not what the previous content was. A customer in a collaboration project made an edit to an issue description that we may not agree to and we have no records about what the previous content was exactly. Everything else is versioned but this important piece is missing.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Description edits should be collapsed by default\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-09-09_at_10.06.37_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/be2f3095d136448a8aa21a33246514ad/Screen_Shot_2019-09-09_at_10.06.37_AM.png)\n\n- Users can expand description edits. This uses the same expand/collapse paradigm as discussions.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-09-09_at_10.06.21_AM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/266bd35ff98087e57228d8f753a49ff5/Screen_Shot_2019-09-09_at_10.06.21_AM.png)\n\n- Once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/26723 is complete, description edits made by the same user within a 10-minute span should reside under the same system note. Since we are showing the actual changes made, we can simplify the language of the system note and just say \"User @username changed the description 3 weeks ago\"\n\n- There is a max-height of 480px. This is twice the max-height of our dropdowns. If a description is longer than this, the content should scroll.\n\n- The diff will show straight markdown, not the markdown preview. This is because inline diffs do not work for headers, images, tables, etc.\n\n- Use the label `Compare with previous version` to expand the diff\n\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n* Whichever path is selected as optimal during the implementation of this issue, please keep in mind that the likely next iteration after tracking is exposing the ability to easily revert to a previous version. **This is out of scope for this MVC**, but should be taken into consideration when selecting the optimal implementation path. \n* Additional conversation around implementation details -

This would allow people to create forks and making changes for personal use or for preparing pull requests, but would prevent people to easily/accidentially (with the click of one button next to the project) create and publish derivative works in the form of public forks.\n\nCurrently the project visibility is restricted by the visibility of the parent repository.\nI am basically asking for a per-project setting which allows specifying the allowed fork visibility level. So even public projects could restrict forking to 'private forks only', or even 'no forks' (similar as seen on bitbucket).\n\nA workaround for my situation would currently be to make the project private, and use gitlab's API and a web form to automatically let any interested person join the project's group.\n\n### Proposal\n\nA per-project setting for private projects which allows specifying the allowed forking behavior: allow forks or only allow private forks. \n\nWe should allow this to be changed in project settings for existing projects.\n\n* When changing this in project settings, we should make sure the user is informed of the effect on any existing forks (existing forks will not be affected) if any exist.\n* When moving to a more restrictive setting (the project previously allowed forks, and now the upstream repo selects \"no forks\"), we should leave any existing forks.\n\n### Design solution\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/34de3c7fb31d26db445f86a87e7190e4/private-forks.png\" height=300px\u003e\n\nFor private projects, add a new element under `Repository` in Project Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Permissions:\n\n- Title: 'Forks'\n- Description: 'Allow users to make copies of your repository to a new project'\n- Dropdown options:\n  - 'Allow public forks'\n  - 'Only allow private forks'\n\nSwitching the toggle off will disallow __all forks__.

It's possible to set a custom path within the repo, but that custom path can't point into other projects or arbitrary URLs. Customer wants a way to configure CI jobs other than the `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the repo. There are some cases, such as when you're working in GitLab and contributing to a open source project that is external to GitLab it can cause problems because the `.gitlab-ci.yml` can not go forward to the upstream (Zendesk: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/19465).\n\nIt can also be used for numerous types of workflows where you have a variety of small code-bases that all need to be processed in the same way and either a) do not want the individual repos to be able to change the CI setup, and/or b) do not want to have to maintain in hundreds of repos. This is helpful for users coming from Jenkins who are using the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin plugin to solve the same use case, and makes migrating to GitLab easier.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe will allow for configuring the path to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` to an arbitrary URL:\n\n* This would work for users that have a service that generates the config file dynamically\n* This would work if the URL points to a file on a different repository (any GitLab instance), as long as the file is publicly accessible. Owners of the project hosting the config file should be able to restrict write access, providing a way to control access to the configuration in a scalable way. \n* This would also let companies organize their `.gitlab-ci.yml`s in a central repository if that was desirable.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nWe also discussed limiting this to only repository paths, for example `/path/to/.gitlab-ci.yml@another-group/another-project`. This has advantages that don't seem to be relevant for the moment, such as:\n\n* pointing to a config file in a project that doesn't allow read by default\n* knowing when the config file changes in order to trigger dependent pipelines\n* knowing the version of the config file\n\nWe could expand on this in the future if it becomes relevant, but for now we can work on a simpler (and more flexible) scope.\n\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-04-07T18:05:04.776Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T01:53:13.485Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T12:43:42.058Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio

What's missing though is an extension to this feature, allowing to easily specify dependency on some build's some stage's artifact **from another project**.\n\nCurrently in the build for executable project I'm simply re-building libraries' code every time I build an executable, which is waste of time and resources. The feature of cross-project dependencies would solve the problem elegantly and make life easier, i.e. no need for additional API keys, curl'ing, secure variables, etc. It also may help others requesting features like gitlab-ce#4768 (better links for artifacts).\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo implement this behavior, we'll add new keywords for `needs` which can reference another project/ref/artifacts in incremental steps as follows:\n\n1. Remove the need for `dependencies`\n\n```yaml\ngenerate_content:\n  needs:\n    - job: another-job-in-this-pipeline\n      artifacts: true\n```\nMR that implements this step: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19943\n\n2. Make cross-project job dependency with Bridge\n\n```yaml\ngenerate_content:\n  needs:\n    - project: this_project # This is addition to mark this dependency as a Bridge job\n      ref: master # This is to filter for the Bridge job \n      job: another-job-in-another-pipeline\n      artifacts: true\n```\n\nThis will bring in the last successfully built artifacts from the `another-job-in-another-pipeline` job on the `master` branch of the project `this_project`.\n\n### Reference\n\nThe following is the original proposal in the issue.\n\n\u003e ### Original Example\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Suppose I have a library project `my-library` and some other project `my-exe` which needs artifacts from `my-library`'s build stage during its build. So, under the proposal, `my-exe`'s `.gitlab-ci.yml` may look something like this:\n\u003e \n\u003e ```yaml\n\u003e ...\n\u003e \n\u003e # build job of my-exe project\n\u003e build:linux:\n\u003e   stage: build\n\u003e   dependencies:\n\u003e   - project: quyse/my-library # mandatory, name of the project\n\u003e     commit: 123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789a # optional, commit hash in my-library repository\n\u003e     branch: master # optional, branch name in my-library repository\n\u003e     tag: v1.1 # optional, tag name in my-library repository\n\u003e     # could be other filters\n\u003e     job: linux-x64 # mandatory, job name defined in .gitlab-ci.yml in my-library\n\u003e   script:\n\u003e     ...\n\u003e \n\u003e ...\n\u003e ```\n\u003e \n\u003e So here CI is supposed to fetch artifacts of the `linux-x64` job of the build of `my-library` project made for specified branch and commit (or specified tag), and unpack them into runner's working directory of `my-exe` build (in the same way as it does currently).\n\u003e\n\u003e # Notes\n\u003e \n\u003e * There's no ambiguity with current usage of `dependencies` field: string value may still mean dependency on some other stage of the same project, and only if it's a YAML map value, then it's an external (cross-project) dependency.\n\u003e * `commit`, `branch` and `tag` fields are all optional, and work as a filter, they may be used simultaneously to resolve ambiguity: for example there could be multiple builds corresponding to the single commit (in different branches), and of course there're multiple builds corresponding to the single branch. (Actually even with both `commit` and `branch`/`tag` specified it could still be multiple builds, for example, if build has been retried, or branch deleted/re-pushed, or whatever). So if there're multiple builds, CI can just use the latest one.\n\u003e * Probably CI must always use the latest *successful* build (from the list of builds matching the filter), i.e. the build where all the stages (not marked with `allow_failure`) are successful, not just the one we are using artifacts from. (Just not sure if such a concept already exists).\n\u003e * If there's no matching builds of the library, the dependent build must wait until one appears (essentially, in the same way as dependent stages are waiting for their dependencies currently).\n\u003e * CI runner should fetch artifacts using its API token, so it should be allowed to access private projects it has been added to (or if it's added to the group, or whatever other rules apply here).\n\u003e * It looks reasonable that this feature will only work across projects of the single Gitlab server.\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-03-29T19:18:20.117Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T13:55:58.238Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T10:21:46.934Z","closed_by":{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","backend","customer","customer+","devops::verify","direction","documentation","group::pipeline execution","missed-deliverable","missed:12.6","pipeline","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":891798,"iid":41,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:04.523Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:46:24.737Z","due_date":"2020-01-17","start_date":"2019-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"}],"author":{"id":128299,"username":"quyse","name":"Alexander Bich","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/128299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/quyse"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":731181,"username":"mbobin","name":"Marius Bobin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a726d6aa37d780309f7b3ea3555a14?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mbobin"},"user_notes_count":80,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":221,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14311","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14311","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14311/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/14311/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#14311","relative":"#14311","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#14311"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":488,"epic":{"id":1643,"iid":488,"title":"Category Vision: System Testing","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/488","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24329613,"iid":14308,"project_id":278964,"title":"Refactor code that create project/group members","description":"- [x] Implement `Members::CreateService` for project/group member creationg\n- [ ] Use only `Members::CreateService`  instead of direct `add_users` like methods. \n- [ ] Move callbacks from Member model into `Members::CreateService`.\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/3421/diffs#note_4468163\n\ncc @rspeicher ","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-03-29T11:55:13.012Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T16:46:47.200Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T16:46:47.050Z","closed_by":{"id":15139,"username":"rspeicher","name":"Robert Speicher","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73c8253932541a7b5cbc5d79493f2bea?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rspeicher"},"labels":["Manage [DEPRECATED]","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::manage","maintenance::refactor"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

It's possible to manually block SSH access for the `git` user in the SSH server configuration, but this still displays the clone for users. For HTTPS, users would have to use an external Nginx/Apache and add a configuration to deny the clone URLs. It's hard and probably imperfect. Again, users still see HTTPS clone URL in the UI. \r\n\r\nCan we add a global option to disable one or the other? The solution would remove that clone option from the UI and ideally would also interface with workhorse/shell to deny those clone actions.\r\n\r\nOne such example is in https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/16920 and is quite a large customer.

We just need to block any push that contains a file with one of the names listed below.\r\n* We need to have a nice error message to say to the user that she can't push this kind of files to the project. Keep in mind [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/issues/57) when formatting the error message.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# AWS CLI credential

For relatively small instances it can be done by simply removing the index and creating a new one. But it's acceptable if indexing can be performed in a few minutes or if you don't have a high availability requirement. For those who should do it with no downtime, we have to prepare documentation on how to do that. It is also needed to prepare pipeline example for [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash).\n\nThe common practice is to use the next strategy:\n* Update the application\n* Create new empty index with new mapping\n* Use Logstash to copy all data from old index to the new one (it's much faster than reading data from database/repository again). Copying should be performed until some date(by date condition) since new data continue to go to the old index. We need to use [Scroll API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/scroll.html) and bulk import here to make it fast. All this stuff can be configured in Logstash.\n* Remove an old index, create an alias to the new one. From this point, GitLab will work with the new index.\n* Run indexing again for date starting from last reindex (to not lose the data).\n\nOne more alternative is to temporary disable elastic search, prepare new index with either GitLab rake tasks or Logtash and enable it again.\n\ncc @dzaporozhets @jacobvosmaer @jnijhof @DouweM \n\n@sytses Not sure if should I mention you in such issues....\n\n**UPDATE**\nI think the more appropriate way to handle this is actually having a versioned index instead. For this purpose, we should have the table `es_indexes(name, is_active, progress)` in the database. On every data updates we would update every active index. While the last index is in the process of the building we could use the oldest active one. In this case, we could switch indexes smoothy and rollback to the old one when there is a need. Although this is not a cheap change, I think it is the best one for us.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n----\n\nRefactor our ES classes so we can have multiple versions of them at the same time, so the application still knows how to query an old index.\n\nTo scope down a bit, this issue only dealt with ActiveModel decoupling. Decoupling of repository commits/blobs indexing has been extracted as another issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12548\n\nRight now if we change an attribute name for example we edit the relevant classes and thus the application \"forgets\" how to query the old index.\n\n**We should define how many versions of indexes we'll support** (infinite? Current and Previous? A set number? In all cases we'll want to keep the version as an incrementing counter I think) Our answer to this would dictate how we'd deal with the refactor (versioned folders? etc.)\n\nWe probably want to allow an infinite number of schemas","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-24T10:13:53.490Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T13:44:51.308Z","closed_at":"2019-09-04T07:21:50.884Z","closed_by":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"labels":["Create [DEPRECATED]","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","advanced search","backend","devops::create","documentation","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:11.11","missed:12.0","missed:12.1","missed:12.2"],"milestone":{"id":731038,"iid":37,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/09/22/gitlab-12-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:40:55.400Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T21:06:04.173Z","due_date":"2019-09-17","start_date":"2019-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/37"},"assignees":[{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"}],"author":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/328/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#328","relative":"#328","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#328"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":428,"epic":{"id":1245,"iid":428,"title":"Elasticsearch admin controls","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/428","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 30, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14469799,"iid":7749,"project_id":278964,"title":"Group Level Description Templates for Issues and Merge Requests","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThere is no way to easily maintain consistency of issue and merge request templates across many projects.

Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\nGroup level issue and merge request templates.\n\n- Specify which project within a group serves as the canonical source of templates across all projects and subgroups within the group. Ideally, extend File Templates to support Description Templates. \n- The specified repo is inherited from the instance to groups. \n- The specified repo is inherited from groups to subgroups.\n- Projects look to their nearest parent group to determine which repository to get their templates from.\n\n### UX\n\nThere is no net-new UX here. This feature will leverage the [File Templates UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/instance_template_repository.html). \n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n#### Option B - Use Markdown Frontmatter Config\n\n- Within a given template, add the ability to set a `group: true` or similar type boolean config.\n- All templates that are `true` would bubble up to the group level.\n- Provide a list of these on the group level somewhere so that it's easier to track down the template source.  \n\nPros:\n\n- Pretty flexible in that various projects can all bubble up different group level templates.\n- No need to \"configure\" anything at the group level.\n\nCons:\n\n- Same as Option A\n\n#### Option C - Templates Interface\n\nAdd interface for managing description templates on the group level.\n\nThe interface would support:\n\n- Adding, editing, removing description templates.\n- Changelog per template\n\nPros:\n\n- First class user experience.\n- Provides a good foundation for future template improvements. \n\nCons:\n\n- More expensive to build and will take longer.\n- Requires creating new API endpoints/functionality. \n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### MVC Breakdown\n\n- Add support for Description templates in the File Templates repo and ensure proper inheritance for the selected repo across instance \u003e group \u003e subgroup \u003e project. \n- Add support for Epic description templates the same way Issue/MR description templates work. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n- They should mirror the same permissions for File Templates. \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- Yes\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n#### Success Metrics \n\n- People get more time back by having a centralized location to manage templates across subgroups and projects (Difficult To Measure).\n- Count of group level description templates created.\n- Count of issues being created from group level templates. \n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- The same repo that is set for File Templates can also store description templates\n- The selected repo is inherited across instance \u003e group \u003e subgroup \u003e project. \n- Description templates successfully populate from the specified file templates repo. \n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers --\u003e\n\n- According to our [pricing model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#four-tiers), solving for this use case most likely aligns with the Director or above, putting this into ~\"GitLab Premium\" \n\n### Links / references\n\n/label ~feature\n\n**Original Description:**\n\u003cdetails\u003e\nLet me preface my suggestion by saying, to me at least, the very idea of a template is to allow one standard structure to be applied in multiple places, keeping the base consistent across the board.\n\nThat said, could we perhaps have the ability to set up issue and merge request description templates per group? Using a common template for all projects in a group would create beautiful consistency, especially in Java environments where an application is made up of many modules, each of which are stored in their own repository.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Description Templates Inheritance Solution Validation\n\nWe have the `File Templates` feature, that can be setup at [group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#group-file-templates) or [instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/instance_template_repository.html#instance-template-repository) level and be inherited by any project within given instance or group.\n\nWe also have issue and merge request [description templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html#description-templates) that currently can only be applied at the level of the project that defines these templates in its repository.\n\n - Example of file templates dropdown with templates repository defined at multiple group levels:\n![file-templates-720](/uploads/c5587dcb290174f8a339babe27ce0cdb/file-templates-720.mov)\n\n - Example of description templates dropdown within same project:\n![issue-templates-720](/uploads/936bccaf4096fe1dee4d1f0902082bb2/issue-templates-720.mov)\n\nAlthough these are described as different features in our docs, both are basically templates, and more than that both sources of the templates leave within the project repository, with only difference that each lives within its own folder(s).\n\nI think it would make sense to combine file and description templates setting at the group level by reusing already existing file templates setting to define from which (single) templates repository should all the projects within the group pull both file and description templates. If the group hierarchy has multiple subgroups each of the subgroups, would be able to define its own templates repository which would add to the list to already existing templates.\n\nSo then the description templates dropdown would look similar to file templates, but listing the issue or merge request templates instead:\n ![issue-templates2-720](/uploads/d63c0596d13e7f1fe12d1c5240e98fdc/issue-templates2-720.mov)\n\n#### Tasks\n\n- ~backend https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293854 - ~~MR Merged(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46222)~~ reverted due to a last minute unaccounted incompatibility with Service Desk templates\n- ~backend https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293904\n- ~frontend https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293905 - ~~MR Merged(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46222)~~ reverted due to a last minute unaccounted incompatibility with Service Desk templates\n- ~frontend https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293906\n- ~documentation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293907\n\n### Release notes\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-03-11_at_11.07.58_AM](/uploads/bbdd42aa6805c1a62d94e0ff29ef4fa3/Screen_Shot_2021-03-11_at_11.07.58_AM.png)\n\nInstead of manually updating the same [description template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html#description-templates) across dozens of projects, you can now centrally manage and source your templates from a single repository. We've extended the [instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/instance_template_repository.html) and [group file templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#group-file-templates) to include issue and merge request description templates. When you add your `.gitlab` directory to your file templates repository, description templates will be available to all projects that belong to the instance or group. Each group or subgroup can also set an additional templates repository, which will enable templates from multiple file template repositories to cascade down to your subgroups and projects.","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-23T20:48:04.595Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T14:06:39.085Z","closed_at":"2021-04-26T14:07:46.697Z","closed_by":{"id":5965371,"username":"jlear","name":"Jake

branch","description":"We're having an issue where when creating a branch from another branch the member_check git hook fails. This is an issue for us, as we have many imported projects which contain existing commits from people who never had an account in GitLab.\r\n\r\nCreate a new project, with member_check git_hook disabled.\r\nClone the empty project, and do the following:\r\n```\r\ngit config --local user.email \"john.doe@example.com\"\r\necho ${RANDOM} \u003e README; git add README; git commit -m\"Testing\" README\r\ngit push\r\ngit checkout -b new-branch-1\r\necho ${RANDOM} \u003e README; git commit -m\"Testing\" README\r\ngit push -u origin new-branch-1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow enable the member check and continue as follows:\r\n```\r\ngit config --local user.email \"\u003cYour valid member e-mail\u003e\"\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit checkout -b new-branch-2\r\ngit push -u origin new-branch-2\r\ngit checkout new-branch-1\r\ngit checkout -b new-branch-3\r\ngit push -u origin new-branch-3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the branch created from new-branch-1 instead of master, the commit hook denies the push. Even though there are no new commits and it should be no different than with new-branch-2 which was created from master.\r\n\r\nI suspect (I'm not a developer) it's going wrong in lib/gitlab/git_access.rb on line 191 where oldrev is actively set to the default branch:\r\n```\r\noldrev = project.default_branch if Gitlab::Git.blank_ref?(oldrev)\r\n```\r\n\r\nProbably either oldrev should be set to the branch the new branch is created from or the rev-list should be retrieved as in:\r\n```\r\ngit rev-list newrev --not --all\r\n```\r\nSee this StackOverflow post:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/22547375/114983\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nBartosz","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-09T16:05:18.924Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T16:01:01.452Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":["Enterprise Edition","customer","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":34997,"iid":9,"project_id":278964,"title":"8.7","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-10T18:42:23.342Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T11:28:12.387Z","due_date":"2016-04-22","start_date":null,"expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/milestones/9"},"assignees":[{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James Lopez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/273486/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jameslopez"}],"author":{"id":300387,"username":"boudekerk","name":"Bartosz Oudekerk","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c150bedb0cbaec83c4ab89555f754503?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/boudekerk"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James Lopez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/273486/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jameslopez"},"user_notes_count":47,"merge_requests_count":7,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/279","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/279","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/279/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/279/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#279","relative":"#279","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#279"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":2269344,"iid":582,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project setting to toggle ability to overwrite merge request project settings","description":"### Resources\nFE @psimyn \n\n### Description\n- Update wording per the mockups / screenshots.\n- New project setting that allows you to _disable_ overwriting approvals settings per merge request.
