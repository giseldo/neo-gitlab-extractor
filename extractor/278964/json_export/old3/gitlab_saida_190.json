Frequently, admins will groom their userbase (either manually or programmatically) for users with no activity and block them - blocking is useful, since it retains the user's history and allows the user to be reactivated later on with an unblock.\n\nWhen a blocked user returns to GitLab and attempts to login, however, they're presented with a relatively generic \"Your account has been blocked. Please contact your GitLab administrator if you think this is an error.\" message, which doesn't give them much guidance on how to proceed. This results in an internal support request and a manual action that needs to be taken by an admin to get them unblocked. \n\nConsidering that this user wasn't blocked for any adverse behavior, there's no reason that we shouldn't allow the user to simply log back in.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Allow admins to \"deactivate\" users via the admin panel and via the API.\n  * Deactivating a user is functionally identical to blocking a user, but does not prohibit the user from logging back in via the UI. Once a deactivated user logs back into the GitLab UI, their account is set to active.\n  * Inactive users do not take up a seat.\n  * Only allow deactivation for users who haven't had any activity in the last 14 days (don't present this option in the UI).\n\nAdditional:\n* Present an error message to an inactive member attempting to pull or push code (they should log back in and reactivate first).\n* Error message for attempting to deactivate a user who has had activity (`last_activity_on`) in the past 14 days via the API.\n* Present a \"your account has been reactivated\" banner to a deactivated member who has logged in and reactivated their account.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### MVC\n\n* Let's add a 'Deactivate' option to the options menu in the Admin \u003e Users overview table.\n* Let's change the confirmations for deactivating and blocking users so that they're not native browser alerts but our own modals with explanations of what blocking and deactivating means.\n* Let's add a 'Sort by' label to the sort by dropdown\n* Let's add the option to deactivate a user to the user page (Admin \u003e Users \u003e User name)\n\n| Menu update | Modal - block | Modal - deactivate | User page | Welcome back message |\n|-------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| ![users-overview](/uploads/e18549cdee55631b614165559c691ef7/users-overview.jpg) | ![modal-block](/uploads/558c79c6fbd2cfea6c4e6eb415180c31/modal-block.jpg) | ![modal-deactivate](/uploads/f09f831b4a2a23b0b7971421757e98be/modal-deactivate.jpg) | ![edit-user](/uploads/536e28a173399272bbcd726305ba1280/edit-user.jpg) | ![desktop-1440px](/uploads/298e21c8d1d162169922861b73dd5d0e/desktop-1440px.jpg) |\n\n#### Future iterations\n\nLet's minimize the amount of work that users need to do to complete this. We can:\n\n1. offer an option to deactivate multiple users that have been inactive to eliminate annoying repetitive work\n2. have a setting to enable automatic user deactivation after x days of inactivity\n\n**Option 1**\n\n| Show an alert on main dashboard | Show an alert on the Admin \u003e Users overview | Confirm modal |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| ![image](/uploads/8d7143c9934c8db35d45d0c7251e4f4f/image.png) | ![users-overview](/uploads/77ed7ba1bf4440cc73f461d4915ae917/users-overview.jpg) | ![modal-deactivate](/uploads/61f004fcdbfaed90bccdf3d9f65404a4/modal-deactivate.jpg) |\n\n**Option 2**\n\n| New settings section collapsed | New settings section expanded |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| ![settings-general](/uploads/ad12b3c52bc1fcb639a9542889e21af5/settings-general.jpg) | ![automatic-deactivation](/uploads/383c0ce4e77fec270103797d538c28d2/automatic-deactivation.jpg) |\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/45012\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41632","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-15T03:17:27.948Z","updated_at":"2022-07-13T02:47:48.877Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T12:40:33.773Z","closed_by":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"labels":["Category:User Management","Deliverable","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::manage","direction","estimation::completed","frontend","group::authentication and authorization","missed-deliverable","potential proposal","priority::1","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":731039,"iid":38,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/10/22/gitlab-12-4-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-07T12:41:53.212Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:43.889Z","due_date":"2019-10-17","start_date":"2019-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},{"id":4093067,"username":"manojmj","name":"Manoj M J","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4093067/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manojmj"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"user_notes_count":78,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":33,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22257","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22257","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22257/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22257/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#22257","relative":"#22257","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#22257"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":256,"epic":{"id":500,"iid":256,"title":"😴 Inactive user management","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/256","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10828251,"iid":6017,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fixed vulnerabilities should not be actionable in the report","description":"Users can interact with reports and dismiss vulnerabilities or create new issues.

This is useful for auditors and security teams, who are concerned with the lifecycle of a vulnerability \u0026 that it has gone through and when it has gone through various processes and stages.\n\n### Proposal\nCreate a system event when a user interacts with a vulnerability. Specifically, create a system event when:\n1. a user creates an issue from a vulnerability\n1. a user changes the state of a vulnerability (e.g. `open`-\u003e`confirmed`, `confirmed`-\u003e`resolved`, etc)\n   1. a user dismisses a vulnerability\n   1. a user reverts a dismissal\n\nThis is in context of the standalone vulnerability itself, not inside the MR. It is also not needed to be displayed in the vulnerability modal window either.\n\n### Designs: \n\n\n##### Status change cases: \n\nWhen a user reverts a dismissal, we'll communicate that as we do with the system note set above. So if a user changes status from dismissed to confirmed we'll communicate that with the confirmed system note since we have a note structure: \n\n[Icon] [user name] [`@user` handle] \"Changed vulnerability status to `x`\" [friendly timestamp]\n\nPrimarily, we will do this as opposed to having a unique system note for reverting the dismissal because: \n\n1. we assume when a user reverts a dismissal it is because the initial dismissal was erroneous due to some type of investigation or re-evaluation. In this case, the user will set the status to confirmed. \n1. we don't allow users to set the vulnerability back to the open status once the status has manually been changed. Allowing this action would cause a breakdown in communication in the dashboard since the vulnerability had been triaged and the open status is meant to communicate to the user that the vulnerability has not been reviewed/triaged yet. \n\n##### Creating an issue from a vulnerability case: \n\nThe syntax will be a bit different from status change: \n\n[Icon] [user name] [`@user` handle] \"Created issue [#123456]() from vulnerability\" [friendly timestamp]\n\nFor this iteration, we won't allow users to disassociate an issue created from a vulnerability due to the assumption that it will cause a break in the SSOT and workflow for the vulnerability. With this understanding, we won't have a system note for disassociating an issue from a vulnerability until we include the feature to allow users to link multiple issues to a vulnerability.  \n\n\n### Dependencies\n* #13561\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOriginal description\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n### Description\n\nAs a follow up of #5151 we want to create system notes in a MR for following events:\n\n- a user dismisses a vulnerability\n- a user reverts a dismissal\n- a user creates an issue from a vulnerability\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-09T16:13:19.146Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T14:44:35.863Z","closed_at":"2020-04-10T14:44:02.737Z","closed_by":{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","Enterprise Edition","Secure UX::Shared","UX","backend","devops::govern","direction","frontend","group::threat insights","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2338871,"username":"andyvolpe","name":"Andy Volpe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2338871/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andyvolpe"},"user_notes_count":45,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5954","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5954","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5954/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5954/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5954","relative":"#5954","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#5954"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":202,"epic":{"id":398,"iid":202,"title":"Security Reports Interactive Feedback","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/202","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10735491,"iid":5940,"project_id":278964,"title":"Manually add entries in the License Management settings","description":"### Description\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5488 we created a settings page to handle license management entries. The list is populated when users add entries from the License Management report, and can be changed or deleted. But there is no way to add a new license in the list manually from the settings page.\n\nA common use case is the following: I already know which are my licenses (approved, blacklisted) when I start my project. I want to enforce it from the beginning, so any developer working on it already knows if there is a conflict or not, without dealing with the \"unapproved\" licenses). With the current flow, we need to wait until a license appears in the report before we can \"action\" it. It would be useful to allow a manual add of the license even before it has been found.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd licenses directly in the settings page. Once added, they are exactly the same as any other entry in the page.\n\nWe can use a dropdown that also allows arbitrary input. The dropdown is preloaded with a list of known licenses.  \nThis allows the following use cases:\n\n1. users open the dropdown and select an existing license from the list\n1. users start to type and the dropdown list is filtered to show only matching entries\n1. users type a license that is not in the preloaded list, and use it as a \"custom\" entry\n\nThe source of the preloaded license list is available at `https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/json/licenses.json`.\n\n### Design\n\n\n| Initial state |\n| -------------

replicating the database from the primary node\":\n\n![image](/uploads/adccd2c0ca22215b891687f39c0b3a9e/image.png)\n\nHowever, the `gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check` seems okay in that respect:\n\n```\nstanhu@web-01-sv-gstg.c.gitlab-staging-1.internal:~$ sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check\nChecking Geo ...\n\nGitLab Geo is available ... yes\nGitLab Geo is enabled ... yes\nGitLab Geo

new step required to enable FDW\n  If you are using Omnibus GitLab try running:\n  gitlab-ctl reconfigure\n  If installing from source, try running:\n  bundle exec rake geo:db:refresh_foreign_tables\n  For more information see:\n  doc/gitlab-geo/database.md\nGitLab Geo HTTP(S) connectivity ... \n* Can connect to the primary node ... yes\nHTTP/HTTPS repository cloning is enabled ... yes\nMachine

instead it is: /opt/gitlab-shell/authorized_keys %u %k\n  If you made a custom command, make sure it behaves according to GitLab's Documentation\n  For more information see:\n

Either we should use the `pg_is_in_recovery()` method or somehow we have to know that `pg_stat_wal_receiver` will not be active if we are using Wal-E streaming.\n\n/cc: @vsizov","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-08T19:41:05.659Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T01:44:11.513Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T15:24:20.398Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GCP Migration","Geo Administration","devops::systems","group::geo","priority::4","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":655279,"iid":27,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.10","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-21T19:08:16.261Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T09:17:49.051Z","due_date":"2019-04-22","start_date":"2019-03-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/27"},"assignees":[{"id":2187482,"username":"ashmckenzie","name":"Ash McKenzie","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2187482/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ashmckenzie"}],"author":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2187482,"username":"ashmckenzie","name":"Ash McKenzie","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2187482/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ashmckenzie"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":3,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5933","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5933","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5933/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5933/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5933","relative":"#5933","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#5933"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1529,"epic":{"id":8648,"iid":1529,"title":"Geo: Status report","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1529","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10709358,"iid":5916,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo: Handle orphaned Uploads records","description":"During manual verification of synced attachments on GPRD, I found 235 uploads associated with one project that does not exist.

Previously you could infer this by looking at the tooltips, but the tooltips now show the pod identifier.\n\nWe should consider showing the raw numbers underneath the percentage complete, or an alternative solution.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2018-05-05_at_10.53.52_PM](/uploads/0a22c6ebb981479d2fc4d6e4e409ed4e/Screen_Shot_2018-05-05_at_10.53.52_PM.png)\n\n#### Design\n- The total of instances shows next to text \"Instances\".\n- When you hover on the \"50% complete\", it shows the completed instances number with a tooltip.\n\n| Total number of instances | The number of completed instances in a tooltip |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![image](/uploads/af64bbd34a992d05a1d1828a61b074ec/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/d6d5937dda415d11c62a259fdb775034/image.png) |","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-07T15:37:24.385Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:35:55.981Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T22:24:26.290Z","closed_by":{"id":502136,"username":"fatihacet","name":"Fatih Acet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/502136/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fatihacet"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","Stretch","devops::monitor","frontend","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":502939,"iid":17,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T17:59:35.838Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:17:11.721Z","due_date":"2018-09-22","start_date":"2018-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/17"},"assignees":[{"id":577113,"username":"hazelyang","name":"Hazel Yang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e84e4d70639ad1177276340868d7f074?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hazelyang"},{"id":2622336,"username":"adriel","name":"Adriel Santiago","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2622336/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adriel"}],"author":{"id":926632,"username":"joshlambert","name":"Joshua Lambert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0bdc5209b11e9c0953f80234dcb4ffb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/joshlambert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":577113,"username":"hazelyang","name":"Hazel Yang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e84e4d70639ad1177276340868d7f074?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hazelyang"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5906","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5906","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5906/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5906/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5906","relative":"#5906","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#5906"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10692168,"iid":5903,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add link to Jenkins integration page","description":"The Jenkins integration service available at **Settings \u003e Integration \u003e Jenkins CI** doesn't have any link to the related documentation available in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html.

Some time later, a sidekiq job will run and update that mutable state in some manner.\n\nIn #5489, I observed that two `Geo::RepositoryUpdatedEvent` events sent in quick succession might not do the right thing, as the sidekiq job for the first event will overwrite the state entered by the log cursor.\n\nI've now observed that a `Geo::RepositoryUpdateEvent` followed by a `Geo::RepositoryDeletedEvent` may also be subject to a similar problem. It goes:\n\n* Geo::RepositoryUpdatedEvent received\n    * project_registry row updated / created\n    * enqueues a sidekiq job\n* sidekiq job for update begins to run\n* Geo::RepositoryDeletedEvent received\n    * enqueues a sidekiq job (irrelevant)\n    * project_registry row deleted\n* sidekiq job for update completes, creates project_registry row\n\nThis case may also explain some of the more-confusing \"orphaned `project_registry` row\" cases we've seen on gprd \\o/\n\nWhere there are two cases, there are probably more, so I think this issue should focus on a more general rethink of how we're managing this mutable state, and how to avoid these kinds of races in general. Every update to the `*_registry` tables needs to take into account the fact that state may have changed since it last looked.\n\nUltimately, this is a consequence of having the log cursor execute its work asynchronously, out-of-order, etc, by pushing long-running tasks into sidekiq. This means we concurrently update the mutable state, and introduces the requirement for some sort of awareness or synchronization between the two updaters.\n\nSince these jobs can be *very* long-running (it could take over an hour to process a `RepositoryUpdatedEvent`, for instance), I don't think we can reasonably drop the asynchronous execution part of the puzzle. I'll puzzle some more in the issue comments.\n\n### Proposals\n\nWe have a number of ideas here. I'll attempt to list them:\n\n1. Optimistic lock registry tables\n1. Version registry resyncs\n1. Use same ExclusiveLease across create, update, delete\n1. Soft delete XRegistry + soft delete XDeletedEvent + clean up\n\nIt seems like we've settled on doing 4) which should solve update-delete races.\n\nBut we also need something like 1) or 2) to eliminate update-update races.\n\nPerhaps we should open a separate issue for 4) and schedule that?\n\nAnd we could hold off scheduling this issue until we come to a decision on update-update races.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-03T15:47:23.259Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T14:51:05.620Z","closed_at":"2018-10-17T17:35:25.747Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["Category:Disaster Recovery","Category:Geo Replication","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","data integrity","devops::systems","group::geo","priority::2","product discovery [DEPRECATED]","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":567672,"iid":20,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.5","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-14T17:32:22.627Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T06:50:07.124Z","due_date":"2018-11-22","start_date":"2018-10-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/20"},"assignees":[{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":59678,"username":"vsizov","name":"Valery Sizov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/59678/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vsizov"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5876","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5876","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5876/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5876/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5876","relative":"#5876","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#5876"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14332758,"iid":7681,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add renewal info to license expiration warning banner","description":"### Overview\n\nThe warning message we present when a license is expiring isn't particularly clear.

Development Panel integration.\n\nThe integration and sync works as expected for projects *without* any _dots_ in the name.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a project with _dots_ in the name, e.g. `my.project.new`\n- Configure the JIRA Development Panel integration as per the [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira_development_panel.html#gitlab-configuration)\n- Observe the account (`root` in this test case) is added to DVCS accounts and the project (`my.project.new`) is listed under \"Repository\"\n- Click to sync the repository in the \"Last activity\" column under the DVCS account\n- Observe the message **Sync failed**\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe sync fails.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe sync should succeed and

or mitigate lengthy delays with CI GitHub integration","description":"### Description\n\nI've been working on using Gitlab CI (my project's at https://gitlab.com/magda-data/magda) with my Github project (https://github.com/TerriaJS/magda), but given that the integration relies on mirroring the Github repo to Gitlab, there can sometimes be a big delay between pushing an update and having the build pipeline actually start (I've seen up to 25 minutes waiting for a sync before the pipeline starts).\n\nThe delay between pushing code and having the build start is annoying to start with, but what makes it worse is that the Gitlab CI check on the GitHub PR:\n\n![image](/uploads/d9ed324d0af9353aba244afc453fc11e/image.png)\n(this thing)\n\nDoesn't actually show up until the build starts, which means that a PR that breaks the build might spend 25 minutes with a tick next to it because the Gitlab build hasn't started yet. If a new commit gets pushed to the PR, the Gitlab CI check actually disappears.\n\n### Proposal\n- Most simply, is it possible to show a yellow (in progress) Gitlab CI check indicator on a Github PR as soon as a new commit is pushed, even if the repository is still syncing?\n- Better yet would be fixing the problem directly - decoupling the Gitlab pipeline from the Gitlab repository, so that the runners can pull from Github instead of Gitlab, removing the need to wait for the sync to finish.\n- Or just somehow making the sync much much faster so that there's no latency?\n\n\n/label ~\"feature proposal\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-02T00:22:53.740Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:36:01.032Z","closed_at":"2019-07-08T12:58:21.127Z","closed_by":{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Enterprise Edition","bug::performance","customer","devops::verify","mirror","missed-SLO","movingtogitlab","needs investigation","priority::3","severity::3","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Look at the merge request widget, and note that there is no review app linked in the widget.\n\nAlternatively, you can reproduce this by logging out and looking at the MR page, no review app link will be displayed in that case either. e.g. for GitLab team members, look at a merge request in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests and compare it between an incognito window vs. when logged in.\n\n### Example Project\n\nYou should be able to reproduce it by looking at a merge request in the `www-gitlab-com` repo (you'll need an account that's not a member of the gitlab-com group): https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests\n\nYou can also see the issue on GNOME's instance with Nautilis: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/merge_requests/205\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nI look at a merge request with a deployed review app, when I'm not a member of the project, and I don't see the review app link.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI should see the review app link for merge requests in any public project, regardless of my membership status.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nWhat a member of the Nautilis project sees:\n\n![image](/uploads/9bf14132769947c35a1e031d9594347f/image.png)\n\nWhat I see, as someone who is not a member:\n\n![image](/uploads/97ace374dc4e908aa7e48abd242c005a/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com as well as GNOME's instance running CE 10.7.1.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI assume there's a check for project membership somewhere in the merge request widget that should be removed?","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-30T19:49:40.868Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T09:44:24.365Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T02:30:50.688Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Review Apps","MR-Improvements","Release::P1","UX","UX debt","backend","cicd::active","deploy","devops::release","group::release","merge request widget","missed:13.1","permissions","release post item::in review","severity::2","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":386624,"username":"connorshea","name":"Connor Shea","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/386624/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/connorshea"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22090","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22090","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22090/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22090/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#22090","relative":"#22090","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#22090"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3598,"epic":{"id":68860,"iid":3598,"title":"Release UX Debt","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3598","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10586655,"iid":5820,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Geo] Add instructions to remove tracking database after promotion","description":"This issue was raised by @dbalexandre:\n\n\u003eDouglas: Should we add instructions to remove the tracking database on the newly promoted primary node?\n\n\u003eStan: Is it advantageous to keep it?

MVC","description":"This issue is intended to serve as an MVC iteration of the larger Ops Dashboard: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1788\n\n## Goals\n\nWe are working on awesome views for the developer to watch their deployments and monitor the state of their apps. But these views are developer-centric. If you are responsible for the overall health of your company's operations, you need a more holistic view.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Instance wide workflow\n\nThis should be an instance wide workflow. \n* Project is too narrowly focused, especially for microservice oriented applications\n* Groups can be used in different ways, and so are also not a good candidate for this workflow. In some cases the microservices of a single app may all be in one group. However it is quite possible for companies to also organize groups based on organizational hierarchy, since a group affects other features like authentication, authorization, and more. It is also possible for there to be 20+ tiers of subgroups, which would introduce further challenges in group design.\n* An instance wide workflow does not suffer from these limitations, and will function regardless of how your group hierarchy is configured. This also would work in the event that you contribute to projects in different groups, or care about the operational health of projects you may not be directly involved in.\n\nWe will need to consider where to place this workflow, since we don't have a traditional home for instance wide workflows today. Possible candidates:\n* Somewhere in your profile\n* A new top level nav item, since we will also have other flows that need this as well like the Security dashboard.\n\n### Able to be set as Homepage\n\nThis flow should be able to be set as your default page when opening GitLab. This way Operations users can have a relevant home page when they login.\n\n### Add projects by searching by project name\n\nWe will add a search box at the top of the homepage, which can be used to search for projects. Selected projects will be added to the homepage.\n* They will appear if you have appropriate access rights to view environments. ([developer or above](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions))\n* Sorting, deleting from page, etc. can be later improvements. \n\n### Dashboard\n\nFor the MVC, we want to show a few key metrics for each project.\n\n* Red/Green status based on whether there are any alerts actively firing.\n  * Clicking on R/G status takes you to the metrics dashboard for that project\n\n### Required internal changes\n\n* Listen for resolved alerts: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7495\n* Persist alert status: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7496\n\n## Design\n\n#### Set as the default dashboard\nYou can set \"Operations dashboard\" as the default dashboard on `Settings \u003e Preferences` (https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences).\n\n![02-set-as-default-dashboard](/uploads/2830010cb9b15abb062f8572e82b4330/02-set-as-default-dashboard.png)\n\n#### Operations dashboard\n- It is at the instance level, so you can access it on the main navigation.\n- It shows two projects in each row.\n- You can add/remove projects directly on the dashboard.\n * Add projects: enter a project name in the search box, and select a result.\n * Remove projects: Click `ellipsis-v` icon and click \"Remove\" in the dropdown menu.\n\n| Default | Add projects | \n| --- | --- | \n|

We can disable this storage, which should dramatically reduce the index size... although we should check by how much.\n\nNote that the drawbacks are many, particularly in the loss of reindexing and dynamic highlighting. We don't use the former at present (but probably should). The latter, we use at present *but* the code relating to it on the Ruby side is so complex, I'm not sure we benefit. We might be better off losing the highlighting, or building our own (non-elasticsearch searching would then benefit too).\n\nSince disabling it comes with drawbacks, and for smaller installs the total index size is not a limiting factor, perhaps we can make this a configurable option?\n\n/cc @mdelaossa @vsizov @victorwu","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T13:37:51.029Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:32:40.398Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T11:01:00.566Z","closed_by":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","Stretch","advanced search","backend","devops::plan"],"milestone":{"id":494367,"iid":15,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-27T19:26:05.990Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:16:51.951Z","due_date":"2018-08-22","start_date":"2018-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"}],"author":{"id":572018,"username":"nick.thomas","name":"Nick Thomas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/572018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nick.thomas"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1642716,"username":"jprovaznik","name":"Jan Provaznik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4577c0b60b7640100030d7ab267aba95?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jprovaznik"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5599","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5599","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5599/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5599/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5599","relative":"#5599","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#5599"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":153,"epic":{"id":274,"iid":153,"title":"Rollout Advanced Global Search  on GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/153","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 13, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24662514,"iid":21811,"project_id":278964,"title":"Utilize the GitLab API for creating and revoking project and group deploy tokens","description":"### Problem to solve\nDeploy tokens allow to read a project repository (through git clone), or read the container registry images of a project without the need of having a user and a password. This allows users to create a single token for their project and avoid using personal access tokens. Deploy tokens can be created within the GitLab application by navigating to the project's `Settings` --\u003e `Repository` --\u003e `Deploy Tokens`. \n\nHowever, for organizations with many groups, sub-groups and projects, it is inefficient and difficult to create deploy tokens for each project. Administrators need a way to easily create and revoke deploy for many groups and projects. \n\n#### Customer quotes\n\u003e Being able to manage deploy tokens through the API allows us to automate token generation. For example each time a new project is created we want to create a deploy token for it which Kubernetes can use to pull container images.\n\u003e Our current workaround is to have a separate \"image pull user\" with an impersonation token which is used as the pull secret, which is less than ideal.\n\n### Intended users\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Further details\n\n#### Project vs. Group Tokens\n- In 12.8, the progressive delivery team is planning on adding support for [group deploy tokens](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/21765).\n- This will add `Repository` as an additional navigation item to the Group settings\n- This proposal will assume that deploy tokens will be created at the group/sub-group/project level.\n\n#### Benefits\n- By supporting this feature with the GitLab API, we will empower administrators at large organizations to better manage how tokens are created and revoked.\n\n#### Graphql Consideration \n- There has been discussion about powering the [GitLab application using GraphQL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/37474). It may be worth considering for this feature.\n\n### Proposal\nCreate a set of new API endpoints that will allow administrators to create, list and revoke GitLab Deploy Tokens at the group/sub-group/project level. \n\n#### Sample Response\n```json\n{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"MyToken\",\n        \"username\": \"gitlab+deploy-token-1\",\n        \"expires_at\": \"2020-02-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"token\": \"jMRvtPNxrn3crTAGukpZ\",\n        \"scopes\": [\n            \"read_repository\",\n            \"read_registry\"\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\n#### Proposed Endpoints\n- List all deploy keys\n  - Get a list of all deploy tokens across all projects of the GitLab instance. This endpoint requires admin access.\n  - `GET /deploy_tokens`\n- List group deploy keys\n  -  Get a list of a specific group's deploy tokens\n  - `GET /group/:id/deploy_tokens`\n- List project deploy tokens\n  - Get a list a projects deploy tokens\n  - `GET /projects/:id/deploy_tokens`\n- Create a project deploy token\n  - Creates a new deploy token for a project.\n  - `POST /projects/:id/deploy_tokens`\n- Create a group deploy token\n  - Creates a new deploy token for a group.\n  - `POST /group/:id/deploy_tokens`\n- Delete a project deploy token\n  - Deletes a new deploy token for a project.\n  - `DELETE /projects/:id/deploy_token/:token_id`\n- Delete a group deploy token\n  - Deletes a new deploy token for a group.\n  - `DELETE /group/:id/deploy_token/:token_id`\n\n### Permissions and Security\n- Creation, listing and deletion of deploy tokens should be limited to maintainers and owners.\n\n### Documentation\n- Add a new page of documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_tokens.html\n- Update https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html with correct permissions for creating/listing/updating deploy tokens at the project and group level\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\n What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended.

This is a novel and unique idea since _\"such fencing will render correctly in native LaTeX too as the curly-braces are treated as grouping and ignored\"_\n\nHowever, doing so would still put GitLab using its own unique syntax, and limit markdown interoperability with other tools.\n\nAs such, we will add the `$...$` and `$$...$$` syntax.  In order to make parsing and syntax less ambiguous, we will adhere to the heuristics specified by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-tex_math_dollars)\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nAnything between two $ characters will be treated as TeX math. The opening $ must have a non-space character immediately to its right, while the closing $ must have a non-space character immediately to its left, and must not be followed immediately by a digit. Thus, $20,000 and $30,000 won’t parse as math. If for some reason you need to enclose text in literal $ characters, backslash-escape them and they won’t be treated as math delimiters.\n\nFor display math, use $$ delimiters. (In this case, the delimiters may be separated from the formula by whitespace. However, there can be no blank lines between the opening and closing $$ delimiters.)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nThe current GitLab math syntax will continue to exist. ``$`...`$`` should be considered deprecated, while ```` ```math...``` ```` will still be considered a primary method for display math.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eOriginal proposal\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nJust had a thought about Markdown math fencing...\n\nSimilar issue to gitlab-ce#29086:-\n\nGitLab currently uses ``$`e^x`$`` for inline math and fenced code block with language id `math` for block math:\n\n```\n```math\n\\int e^t dt\n```​\n```\n\nNeither of these syntaxes is supported by external Markdown editors or the original LaTeX language by default. This means that these documents only display correctly on GitLab.\n\nI am thankful that GitLab thought about how to support mathematics in markdown on site, and I believe that much effort went into the deliberation. This is a tough issue because converting pure `$` pair into LaTeX will result in much false positive, yet `(`, `[` \u0026 `{` type of parenthesis were already heavily used in usual text fencing. We will most likely need 2-characters at least to do proper fencing that does not result in false positive. `\\(`, `\\[`, and `\\\\(` etc were proposed but they 1.) do have false positive, e.g. with regex, and 2.) are not supported by the original LaTeX specification.\n\n### Proposal\n\nFence inline math with `${` and `}$` pair for inline math, and fence block math with `$${` and `}$$`.

This is very useful when you are reviewing the commit history of a repository, and want to find business and technical context of a commit\n\nThis functionality has now been extended to include merge request data for both squash and merge commits.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-30T09:22:49.312Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T09:19:45.895Z","closed_at":"2021-01-28T22:00:04.602Z","closed_by":{"id":1931266,"username":"danielgruesso","name":"Daniel Gruesso","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1931266/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/danielgruesso"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","GitLab Core","SCM QoL","SUS Survey","UX","api","backend","backend-weight::3","customer","devops::create","direction","frequently duplicated","group::source code","merge requests","release post item","release post item::in review","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233759,"iid":55,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.8","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:23.220Z","due_date":"2021-01-17","start_date":"2020-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"}],"author":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":421631,"username":"vyaklushin","name":"Vasilii Iakliushin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/421631/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vyaklushin"},"user_notes_count":61,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":68,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21686","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/21686","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/21686/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/21686/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#21686","relative":"#21686","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#21686"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":166,"epic":{"id":300,"iid":166,"title":"Improve commit list and details","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/166","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":10002423,"iid":5503,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST for the master branch","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\nIn AutoDevOps today, we run DAST only on feature branches, since DAST can unintentionally damage an application's state, which is not desirable in a production environment.\n\nUsers cannot know the current status of the `master` branch, and so they can only check the report from the latest feature branch. This is complex, not easy to do, and doesn't display results about what they are actually deploying to production and any interactions that may occur between features.\n\nThere is also no base DAST scan to compare against for merge requests. This means that developers reviewing DAST results cannot be sure if the MR introduces new security issues or if they already existed.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\nAs part of AutoDevOps, run DAST on the `master` branch inside a dedicated review app. Do NOT run DAST against a deployed environment like `production` or `staging` that a user has configured.\n   * [X] Can this re-use the existing technical mechanisms we have today for review apps? _Yes it can. This is already being done on feature branches, and on default branches named something other than `master`._\n\nIntroduce a mechanism, such as an environment variable, to disable DAST on `master` if the users wishes to do so. By default, DAST should be run on `master`.\n   * [ ] To lessen the pipeline speed impact, can this be done in parallel with other stages in AutoDevOps? Perhaps using the [DAG] capability from 12.2?(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47063#note_198167487)\n   * [X] Are environment variables a reasonable suggestion here or would something else be better? _They're a good suggestion. We can use `.gitlab-ci.yml`'s ability to exclude jobs based on an environment variable to implement this._\n\nUse the `master` branch DAST results as a basis for comparison in MRs to determine vulnerabilities newly introduced in that branch\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n~\"Persona: DevOps Engineer\" \n~\"Persona: Security Analyst\" \n~\"Persona: Development Team Lead\" \n~\"Persona: Product Manager\" \n\n### Further details\n\n\u003c!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) --\u003e\n\nTelemetry: Usage ping and Gitlab.com reporting should indicate if DAST was run on `master`\n\n\u003c!--### Permissions and Security--\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\nDocumentation will need to be updated to describe the fact that DAST will apply to the `master` branch and be very clear about it being done in a review app.\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n* Tests should be done to confirm that DAST results on `master` match what is expected from a respective feature branch.\n* Tests should be done to confirm deployed environments are not affected and that review apps are properly used.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\nWe can measure success of DAST on `master` with:\n\n* Number of DAST scans done on master in 30 days. Target = 1000\n* Percentage of repos using AutoDevOps that have DAST on `master` enabled 30 days after this feature is live. Target = 50%\n   * This will confirm users get enough value to keep this capability enabled.\n* Percentage of vulnerabilities created from DAST on `master` results, rather than from an MR, in the first 30 days. Target = 25%\n   * This will confirm that DAST on `master` is providing valuable report results that either weren't visible or weren't noticed on the MR DAST results.\n\n### What is the type of buyer? \n\n\u003c!-- Which leads to: in which enterprise tier should this feature go?

This is the smallest iteration that provides incremental benefits allowing the user access to a REPL, and allows them to commit their changes and then test the change immediately rather than waiting for the whole suite to execute. We intend to immediately follow this feature with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5276 to make this workflow much much better. Also, it highly probable that this first iteration can't be enabled in production while changes are being made to the CI runner in parallel, which means that the first publicly accessible version will have mirroring anyway.\n\n### Proposal\n\nFollowing investigation from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5281\n\nIf a `web-ide` job is defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` and a runner is available, a button should be shown offering the user should be able to open the web terminal and start the job.\n\nWhen using the web terminal, it should be possible to:\n\n- start/stop/restart the web terminal\n- resize the web terminal\n\n### Designs\n\n| Pane expanded (all good) | Pane expanded (not configured) | Pane expanded (no runners available) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| ![expanded-stopped](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/4894662384189f59526da18b08a48888/expanded-stopped.jpg) | ![how-to-configure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/12b848e9c897ba487e90d79f479dc15f/how-to-configure.jpg) | ![configure-runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/58bd1ba741c224ef977a10f7d810d4f7/configure-runner.jpg) |\n\n| Terminal Starting... | Terminal Started | Restart prompt (when changing branch or modifying config) |\n|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| ![expanded-starting](/uploads/2efc5312163a8dc84bd02ffdc003098f/expanded-starting.jpg) | ![expanded-started](/uploads/eafd648a26bb223d171a818ba144fed4/expanded-started.jpg) | ![restart-prompt](/uploads/e72248f6a8196abc9f836a1493756338/restart-prompt.jpg) |\n\n### Links\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5281\n\n### User Stories\n#### The Web IDE loads\n\n- The terminal button won't appear if the license feature is not present\n\n#### User clicks the terminal button\n\n- If no proper `web-ide` job is present in the `.gitlab_ci.yml` file then we show a message to the user with a hint about how to configure it. **Note:** in the description says that we won't show the button in this case, but this way we can show the user how to configure the feature.\n  - When the user changes the branch, we have to check the config file again and show the proper message in the tab\n  - **Edge case**: User modifies the config file through the web editor. We have to choices to handle this:\n     - Allow the user to click the `Start Terminal` button with no action.

Previously, users were able to define the [pull policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#how-pull-policies-work) on the runner level only, in this release we've added the pull_policy keyword to .gitlab-ci.yml which will allows you to define different pull policies on the pipeline level, this feature does not support shared runner. \n\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, image pull policy is defined on the GitLab runner level. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/merge_requests/115\n\n### Proposal\n\nIt should be possible to define it in `gitlab-ci.yml`. Example:\n\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  image:\n    name: $CI_REGISTRY/dreamhost/kubectl-helm-docker\n    pull_policy: always # available: always, if-not-present, never\n  script:\n  - ...\n```\n\nThe desired pull policy is context-dependent. We need to use the very latest images in some cases, and we can use a cached version in other cases. Since it's context-dependent, it perfectly belongs to `.gitlab-ci.yml`. :smiley: \n\nBecause of the security concerns which are mentioned in this issue description this feature will be opt-out from .com users that are using shared runner, the feature will be available for self managed instance and .com users with registered runners only, for more information please read through the [security consideration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21619#security-considerations) and [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21619#note_416546568)\n\n### Security considerations\n\nLet's consider that we have a shared runner (e.g. a group runner or an instance runner) that can be used by multiple groups. A runner that is shared and that allows to execute many subsequent jobs on the same environment (e.g. a `docker+machine` executor with `MaxBuilds` greater than 1).\n\nAnd let's consider that one of the groups - `group A` - wants to use an image named `registry.gitlab.example.com/group-a/private-project:latest` as the base of the job. The image contains a private code that should be not revealed and because of that is built and stored in a private project. To pull this image one must be properly registered into GitLab's images registry **and** must have access to the `group-a/private-project` project.\n\nA good example is a developer `developer-A` being a member of `group-a/private-project` who pushes a code to a public project `group-a/public-project`. The pipeline and jobs are created with the user `developer-A` inheriting all of his permissions, including permissions to `group-a/private-project` project. The job that uses `image: registry.gitlab.example.com/group-a/private-project:latest` authenticates to the registry with `gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}` credentials, get's the permissions of `developer-A` and properly pulls the image, starts the job and goes forward.\n\nNow, let's consider that another developer - `developer-B` - who is not a member of `group-a` nor `group-a/private-project`, want's to get access to a propriety, secret content of `group-a/private-project` through the content of the built image. The user creates a project `developer-B/steal-content-of-group-A-private-project` with a job defined with `image: registry.gitlab.example.com/group-a/private-project:latest` and in the job script scans all of the directories and tries to get as much details as possible from there.\n\nNo, what are the possible scenarios:\n\n1. **`pull_policy` set to `if-not-present`**\n\n    Runner first asks Docker if an image `registry.gitlab.example.com/group-a/private-project:latest` is present locally. **If it is, then it's used as is and the container is created**. There is no `docker pull` equivalent which means that anyone who have access to such Docker Engine is able to use any locally available image. In context of GitLab CI and our history above it means that `developer-B` can successfully run his job which uses `registry.gitlab.example.com/group-a/private-project:latest` image (the one where normally he have no access to!) as the base, allowing the user to get all of the secret content from it.\n\n1. **`pull_policy` set to `always`**\n\n    Runner doesn't care about the presence or absence of the `registry.gitlab.example.com/group-a/private-project:latest` image. `docker pull` equivalent is executed to pull the image from the registry. If the image was present locally the positive side is that the pull will be limited to compare what layers should be downloaded and if there was no update to the image in the registry, no real downloading will happen. **But in any case, the authentication will be done**.\n\n    This means that in `developer-A` - the allowed one - case, authentication using `CI_JOB_TOKEN` credentials will pass and the image will be pulled (or confirmed that it's in the newest version locally).\n\n    **But in the `developer-B` - the thief - case, authentication using `CI_JOB_TOKEN` will fail, which will fail the job and pulling nor execution of the script will never happen!**.\n\nSo the definition of `pull_policy` may, or may not create a security gate allowing an unauthorized actor to get access to a private code. And this must be taken into consideration if we want to make `pull_policy` configurable also from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.\n\nWhile I totally see all of the benefits of having this setting configurable in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, especially for \"private\" Runners that are handling specific cases of a specific team, the administrator of the Runner should be able to decide whether support for this feature is allowed or not.\n\nIt's like with the `namespace overwrite` feature in Kubernetes executor. It's useful and powerful, but it creates a security breach. And because of that we've added a configuration field in `config.toml` where the runner administrator can decide whether namespaces overriding is allowed and - optionally - what other namespaces can be set.\n\nThe above security concerns are documented at https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/#usage-of-private-docker-images-with-if-not-present-pull-policy and https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#how-pull-policies-work.\n\n### Implementation\n\n- GitLab (~\"backend-weight::2\" for Rails)\n  - [ ] Add support for parsing `pull_policy` property in [`image` element](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/798e3475429800a09716819075635d3426298225/lib/gitlab/ci/config/entry/image.rb) of `.gitlab-ci.yml` and [returning it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/services/ci/register_job_service.rb) in `JobResponse`.\n- Runner\n  - [ ] Add [`pull_policy` field](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/966/diffs#784d16d046262daaf0974ce8a61882a52cbfdc85_195_195) in [`JobResponse` struct](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/3b94d48643a8bbbe6373ea68461a9414faed5979/common/network.go#L292) in Runner (gitlab-runner!966).\n  - [ ] Leverage `pull_policy` in Kubernetes executor (gitlab-runner!966).\n  - [ ] Leverage `pull_policy` in Docker executor.\n  - [ ] Allow GitLab Runner administrators to restrict allowed pull policies by adding an `allowed_pull_policies` configuration under Docker and k8s executor configuration sections in `config.toml`.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe documentation should mention that this feature is available for self managed and .com users that are not using shared runners (have runners registered to their group/project) since it requires an admin access to the runner\n\n\n### Links / references\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/merge_requests/115\n\n@markpundsack @ayufan @grzesiek @markglenfletcher\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-23T17:10:34.232Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T13:17:06.747Z","closed_at":"2022-07-14T20:33:30.300Z","closed_by":{"id":9468400,"username":"marknuzzo","name":"Mark Nuzzo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9468400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marknuzzo"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Category:Pipeline Authoring","DEPRECATE_pipeline authoring","GitLab Free","[Deprecated] Category:Runner","auto updated","backend","customer","devops::verify","direction","gh-competitive","group::pipeline authoring","missed:13.7","potential proposal","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":536451,"username":"Nowaker","name":"Damian Nowak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6c44da17cd76ce95e9690e135ce21ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Nowaker"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":165,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":115,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21619","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/21619","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/21619/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/21619/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#21619","relative":"#21619","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#21619"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":54830,"iid":71,"sequence":20,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":"Target milestone `15.3`","state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-01T00:05:30.720Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T00:05:02.141Z","start_date":"2022-07-11","due_date":"2022-07-24","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/54830"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":9889363,"iid":5419,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create issue from epic","description":"## Problem to solve\n### Summary\nIt's not possible to create an issue from within an epic, leading to a frustrating, overly complex workflow to break an epic into smaller issues for implementation. This has been referenced in no less than 6 customer calls (as of 10/30/19) *as a major blocker for adoption*\n\n### Job Story\nWhen breaking an Epic apart into issues, I want to be able to create a new Issue directly from the Epic I am working on, so I can create multiple Issues quickly without having to navigate to a different page or open a new tab, then switch back.\n\n#### Situation\n_When I'm working on a roadmap for a specific feature or feature set..._\n\n#### Motivation\n_I need to create issues that correspond to a given epic that enable me to break down an epic into more digestible vertical feature slices..._\n_Force:_ It's frustrating to have to go create an issue in another tab, then come back to the tab with the epic, and add it as a related issue manually. \n\n_Force:_ It's annoying that the proposed solution forces me to just create a stub, then open the issue in another window to edit it further. This breaks the workflow and is counter to how I ideally expect to efficiently iterate on a roadmap. \n\n#### Expected Outcome\n_So that I can quickly iterate on the issues that comprise the larger epic..._\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\nPersonas can be found at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/ --\u003e\n\nProduct managers, project managers, directors\n\n## Further details\n\n* There are several use cases included in the broader goals for iterating on the epics view to make it a more coherent and efficient workflow for building a roadmap (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13242).\n\n### Actual Customer \"Minimal Marketable Feature\" Criteria:\n\n\u003e Plan needs to be able to easily be refined, ideally without screen switching, to add break-downs until the leaf items are user stories small enough to be done in a sprint (e.g. 2 weeks).\n\n\u003e Need some way to lay out high level view and plan (think Initiatives and Features in Rally screenshot) – needs to indicate parent/child relationship directly, highly editable without constant screen switching, etc.\n\n## Proposal\n### Important\n* We still need to support adding an issue manually and not have a regression in feature capabilities. \n\n### MVC Proposed Workflow - Inline, Not Editable Within Epics\n- Create issue from epic, inline, similar to how you can do that from an issue board.\n- Should not navigate you away from the epic itself.\n- All you do is enter the issue title, select project, and submit it inline.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-05-17_at_12.22.34_PM](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/0934ef14ab6187b07a3677395b11a24e/Screen_Shot_2019-05-17_at_12.22.34_PM.png)\n\n### Next Iteration\nProvide the capability to work with an issue without leaving the epic view. (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13319)\n\n[Design / Discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5419#note_199098023) \n\n### Open Questions\n1. [ ] This issue as stated is only addressing creating issues. How much additional work would it be to apply the same constructs to create epics from within epics? If it's large, we can expose this behavior in a follow-on issue. \n1. [ ] How we will support adding an issue manually to an epic (current functionality) so we don't introduce any regressions? \n\n### Implementation Notes\n\n* Use components from Pajamas. If they don't exist, contribute them if at all possible. Let's try to only create custom front-end components as an absolute last resort.  \n\n## Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)? --\u003e\n\n* Permissions should mirror the current configuration for those who can epic/update epics within a given group.\n\n## Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements --\u003e\n\n* [ ] Update [Epics Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/)\n\n## Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further guidelines: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n* If we opt for an option with more issue interaction within an epic view, we will need to thoroughly test that all issue functionality we are exposing works the same as working within an issue view. \n\n## What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n#### Success Metrics\n* Count of issues created from within epics over a given period, avg. issues created per unique users over a given period.\n* Discrete action count for creating a minimum issue within an epic is 3-4 or fewer (not inclusive of clicks within an issue such as tabbing from field to field, etc.). This would be represent something like a ~40% efficiency gain over the current workflow. (current workflow is something similar to: right click + open issue list in new tab, select project, start issue creation, enter title, submit, copy URL, switch to epic tab, click `+`, paste Issue URL, click \"Add\" \n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n* [ ] A user can create an issue from within an epic.\n* [ ] A user can still manually add an existing issue to an epic. \n* [ ] We are collecting the relevant telemetry to view the success metrics. \n* [ ] Overall test coverage increases or stays the same (meaning we've at a minimum appropriately added unit and integration tests for this feature)\n* [ ] The selected option from the Proposal helps us intentionally get closer to the goal of a more streamlined user experience when working within epics (i.e. a user shouldn't need to open 40+ tabs to plan out a multi-level feature).\n\n## What is the type of buyer? \n\n* Ultimate / Gold\n\n## Links / references\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION

The end goal: we'd like to be able to offer highly secure organizations the ability to log into a GitLab instance by providing credentials from a [CAC SmartCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card). At a (very) high level:\n\n1. A user who wants to log in to their organization's GitLab instance would be presented with an option to log in via SmartCard.\n1. The user is required to enter a PIN, unlocking the SmartCard. This is verified against an authority and matched to a EDIPI number on the card, which serves as a unique user identifier.\n1. The EDIPI is matched against a connected LDAP system, and we fetch the associated user.\n1. We log the user in, or create the user if they don't already exist on the instance.\n\n### Proposal\n\nInvestigate implementation for CAC/SmartCard authentication. This issue is done when we have an implementation path laid out that we'll use in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/726.\n\n### Open questions\n\nTo be enumerated.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-23T00:13:01.274Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:38:18.907Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T10:47:07.132Z","closed_by":{"id":87854,"username":"DouweM","name":"Douwe Maan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d1548ae618321220679b3a4fda7fb1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DouweM"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","authentication","backend","needs investigation","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":494367,"iid":15,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-27T19:26:05.990Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:16:51.951Z","due_date":"2018-08-22","start_date":"2018-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":171554,"username":"reprazent","name":"Bob Van Landuyt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/171554/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/reprazent"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5411","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5411","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5411/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/5411/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5411","relative":"#5411","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#5411"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":279,"epic":{"id":576,"iid":279,"title":"Authenticate with a smart card","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/279","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":19073141,"iid":10399,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add `requested` resources to cluster monitoring","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently, we track the total amount of resources (CPU/Memory) and how much is being consumed.
