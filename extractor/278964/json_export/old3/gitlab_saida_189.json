[{"id":12155932,"iid":6494,"project_id":278964,"title":"Sort by start date and end date in the roadmap view and epics list view","description":"### Description\n- Have identical sorting options and UI in the roadmap view and the epics list view, to make things simple and reusable.\n- Sorting should occur \"after\" you have rendered the roadmap page.\n- That is, after you have loaded the page, and you have made your timescale selection, that will automatically determine which set of epic bars appear on the screen.\n- And then from there, of those roadmap bars that appear on the screen, it should sort them per the sort chosen.\n\n### Details\n- This issue adds sort by start date of the epic and the end date of the epic.\n- ~~In the UI you should have functionality to sort in both directions. So sort by ascending/descending start date and the same for end date.~~ https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7210\n- The sort direction is ascending for both dates. (ie closest to negative infinity time first). \n- If a date is not set for a particular epic, and you sort on that date (regardless of direction), that epic appears last in the view.\n- The sorting choice should be stored in the backend per user, for the entire instance. So if the user makes a different choice, that choice is saved and will be remembered anywhere else they log in. This one choice carries over to all roadmap and epic list views that the user views.\n   - To be clear: the sorting choice is applied to both epic list and epic roadmap, so if you switch between them, the sorting is the same.\n- The new date sort options should be added to the epics list API.\n- The dropdown should show these sorts:\n  - `Planned start date`\n  - `Planned finish date`\n  - `Created date`\n  - `Last updated`\n\nThe dropdown should be added to the roadmap view to the right of the search bar. It should be in the same as the epics list. \n\n![6C4CFE3E-DAEF-4196-8DDE-AA3640969ECE](/uploads/8d718e81131d70b6438c4cfc98ca0442/6C4CFE3E-DAEF-4196-8DDE-AA3640969ECE.jpeg)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-19T17:57:39.459Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:29:20.521Z","closed_at":"2018-09-05T11:53:08.843Z","closed_by":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","backend","devops::plan","epics","frontend","roadmaps","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":502939,"iid":17,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-09T17:59:35.838Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:17:11.721Z","due_date":"2018-09-22","start_date":"2018-08-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/17"},"assignees":[{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},{"id":508743,"username":"jarka","name":"Jarka Košanová","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3931dae84deb01d2881e4909077b8dbe?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jarka"},{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"}],"author":{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6494","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6494","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6494/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6494/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6494","relative":"#6494","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6494"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":236,"epic":{"id":464,"iid":236,"title":"Sorting in epics list view and roadmap view","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/236","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2018","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24664415,"iid":22851,"project_id":278964,"title":"Branches index view is performing n + 1 requests","description":"The branches page, like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/branches, is hugely expensive to calculate and render.\n\nRight now there are 2 N + 1 gitaly endpoints in one controller.

Template types are separated via individual tabs\n\n### Designs\n\n#### Changing template source\n\n**Admin area → Settings → Custom project templates**\n\n![set-project-template-source](/uploads/684d25d67ede7cca0c07165837fa26e8/set-project-template-source.png)\n\n#### Create project from a template\n\n| Built-in | Custom |\n|----------|--------|\n| ![new-project--built-in](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/299614d9112a499e6a0fe3cea55196a5/new-project--built-in.png) | ![new-project--custom](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/84a9ffa129566421ec987b32018f14af/new-project--custom.png) |\n\n#### Implementation details\n\n- Projects are displayed as templates based on the **default branch**\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n* If a template group is defined, projects inside this group are made available as project templates when creating a new project.\n\n### Links / references\n\n- gitlab-ce#32420\n- gitlab-ce#36886","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-18T08:11:41.340Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T09:53:13.865Z","closed_at":"2018-08-05T07:46:00.431Z","closed_by":{"id":444,"username":"dzaporozhets","name":"Dmytro Zaporozhets (DZ)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/444/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzaporozhets"},"labels":["Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","Product Vision 2018","backend","direction","frontend","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":494367,"iid":15,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-27T19:26:05.990Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T19:16:51.951Z","due_date":"2018-08-22","start_date":"2018-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":181229,"username":"leipert","name":"Lukas 'Eipi' Eipert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/19a1f1260fa70323f35bc508927921a2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/leipert"},{"id":955795,"username":"fjsanpedro","name":"Francisco Javier López","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/955795/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fjsanpedro"},{"id":2003748,"username":"jeethukarthik","name":"Jeethu Karthik","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2003748/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeethukarthik"},{"id":2263795,"username":"akaemmerle","name":"Andreas Kämmerle","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/52b29212f6c52f2d58d8fd848e43a7d9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/akaemmerle"}],"author":{"id":2263795,"username":"akaemmerle","name":"Andreas Kämmerle","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/52b29212f6c52f2d58d8fd848e43a7d9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/akaemmerle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":181229,"username":"leipert","name":"Lukas 'Eipi' Eipert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/19a1f1260fa70323f35bc508927921a2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/leipert"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":15,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6860","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":1},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"1 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6860","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6860/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6860/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6860","relative":"#6860","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6860"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":195,"epic":{"id":391,"iid":195,"title":"Custom project templates","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/195","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 22, 2018","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24664387,"iid":22831,"project_id":278964,"title":"Provide Release Description from Tag in CI/CD pipeline variable","description":"### Release notes\n\nPreviously, there was no easy way to refer to release notes associated with a tag or a release as part of a pipeline. With this update, you can now easily refer to this information by using two new predefined environment variables, `$CI_COMMIT_TAG_MESSAGE` and `$CI_RELEASE_DESCRIPTION`. This allows you to incorporate this information as part of your deploy workflow.\n\n### Problem to solve\nAllow easy access to the release description in the CI/CD pipeline.\n\n### Further details\nI want to access the Release notes associated with a tag so that I can use them when creating a release in Octopus Deploy. Currently I can't see any way of doing this short of writing code to pull the data from the Tags API.\n\nWe tag new versions of our software with a tag such as \"v1.0.0\". We have GitLab CI/CD setup to deploy the new version to our S3 bucket when such a tag is pushed. We also deploy release notes along side the artifact. There's a variable called `$CI_COMMIT_TAG` to get the tag name, but there's no such variable to get the tag message. I know there are still ways to get it, but I want to save time by being able to use a simple environment variable.\n\n### Proposal\nSimply make the release notes available as a variable in the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nintroduce a CI/CD env variable such as `$CI_COMMIT_TAG_MESSAGE`. Possibly also `$CI_COMMIT_TAG_RELEASE_NOTES`.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nRelease notes text is available as a CI_ variable within the CI/CD pipeline.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb b/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb\nindex 1e328c3c573..cb1d2ab4a4d 100644\n--- a/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb\n+++ b/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb\n@@ -851,6 +851,8 @@ def predefined_commit_variables\n           variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG', value: source_ref_slug)\n           variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_BRANCH', value: ref) if branch?\n           variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_TAG', value: ref) if tag?\n+          variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_TAG_MESSAGE', value: project.repository.find_tag(ref).message) if tag?\n+          variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_TAG_RELEASE_NOTES', value: project.releases.find_by(tag: ref).description) if tag?\n           variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE', value: git_commit_message.to_s)\n           variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_TITLE', value: git_commit_full_title.to_s)\n           variables.append(key: 'CI_COMMIT_DESCRIPTION', value: git_commit_description.to_s)\n\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-18T01:29:56.376Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T12:03:43.683Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T13:02:27.545Z","closed_by":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Deliverable","GitLab Free","Next Up","Release::P1","auto updated","backend","devops::release","group::release","pipeline","potential proposal","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"}],"author":{"id":2474704,"username":"hastarin1","name":"Jon Benson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bc97fb1f8d1ba453b471c561afed5a3e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hastarin1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"user_notes_count":49,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":44,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22831","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22831","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22831/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/22831/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#22831","relative":"#22831","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#22831"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2285,"epic":{"id":15758,"iid":2285,"title":"Release Notes","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2285","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":12065398,"iid":6471,"project_id":278964,"title":"Roadmap bar edges using fixed/dynamic start and end dates","description":"### Background\nhttps://youtu.be/pUNS2me8_j4\n\n### Description\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6470, an epic's chosen planned start and planned end dates can be independently chosen to be fixed or dynamic.

This is good for top-down planning, when you want to set an estimate of when an epic begins and ends, or you want to set target dates.\n- For bottoms-up planning or for tracking, you already have a set of issues with milestones associated with them. So when you group multiple issues into an epic, you want the epic to reflect the milestone dates of those issues. In particular, this will help you understand when the epic will actually start and and actually end, based on the assigned issues.\n\n### Description\n\nImplementation of the epic date changes in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6157\n\n- An epic has two date fields, a planned start date field and a planned end date field.\n- For each date field, the user can choose one of two modes for it to be in: `Fixed` and `From milestones`.\n- When in `Fixed` mode, the user manually sets the date value.\n- When in `From milestones` mode, the value is determined automatically (and dynamically):\n  - This is based on the issues that are assigned to the epic currently.\n  - For the planned start date field, look at all the issues assigned to the epic currently. For all those issues, look at all the milestones that are assigned to those issues. For all those milestones, find the earliest start date of those milestones (closest to negative infinity time). That earliest start date value becomes the planned start date field here.\n  - If no earliest start date exists, the planned start date is null.\n  - Similar algorithm for planned end date.\n- When in `From milestones` mode, we also want to show to the user (in the epic sidebar view), which milestone is the one that contributes to the earliest start date, per the algorithm above.\n- Per the design of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6448#scenarios-when-this-composite-column-needs-to-be-updates, the planned start date (and planned end date) are updated in the system every time there is a change in the system that would trigger it, per the logic above.\n\nSo in the sidebar view of an epic, we want to show for the planned start date and planned end date:\n- Which selection the user has chosen: `Fixed` vs `From milestones`.\n- It should show the `Fixed` manual date.\n- It should show the `From milestones` dynamic/automatic date.\n- When you hover over the `From milestones` dynamic/automatic date, it should show which milestone contributed to that date.\n\n[:mag: Design specs with the most up-to-date solution](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design/hosted/pedro/ee%236470-milestone-dates-integrated-epics-spec-previews/)\n\n| Empty: Editable | Empty: Read-only | Filled: Editable | Filled: Read-only | Edit | Hover: From milestones | Hover: feature explanation | Hover: warning |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/7c004bcafb8433c5c93c74644ffedffc/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/34c5bbb4079dbbfad52fc902f2a188a1/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/af05d5b79d4bea3c714612195b30a859/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/81a6881cf72e2d90f7584a2c576e6308/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/8e63e577a908c1d07cb493c74e784056/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/4d3617cd488bca8904292f9cd19a29ba/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e6ce7e09589d7daf6b451db0ad8bff4e/image.png) | ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/9630720900ce7afd8914f8123b46d4e3/image.png) |\n\n**Only show a warning icon (and tooltip) for selected dates (even if the user doesn't have permission to edit).** Unselected dates don't have icon nor tooltip.

Also you would be able to prioritize them within a sprint easily too.\n\n- Note that in this use case, the \"milestones\" are indeed sprints/iterations in Agile. But in the future, we want to extend milestones to also mean releases (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/69). I.e. in GitLab currently we don't have a distinction between release vs iteration natively.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe add a third tab to the `Add list` dropdown for Milestones where users can choose a milestone to create a list:\n\n| Adding a milestone list | Milestone list |\n|-------------------------|----------------|\n| ![ee_5983__issue-board--milestone-list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/f44041e472a7f897d069af54071a15a2/ee_5983__issue-board--milestone-list.png) | ![ee_5983__issue-board--milestone-list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/uploads/e7872579291c6fca344dc9c0285a23fa/ee_5983__issue-board--milestone-list.png) |\n\nThe label of the new tab will be `Milestone`. The labels of the other two tabs will need to be modified: 'Label{-list-}' and 'Assignee{-list-}'.\n\nThe help text for the Milestone tab will be:\n\n\u003e Milestone lists show all issues from the selected milestone\n\nThe width of the dropdown will be increased to `312px` to accommodate for the third tab.\n\nMilestone lists will display the milestone's name next to the milestone icon, `icn/timer`.\n\n#### Behavior\n\nSee https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#dragging-issues-between-lists for existing behavior. \n\nFor project-level boards, the `Add list` dropdown will show all milestones from that project, from all milestones from its direct parent group, and from all milestones from ancestor groups beyond the parent.\n\nFor group-level boards, the `Add list` dropdown will show all milestones from that group and all milestones from ancestor groups.\n\nSince an issue can only have one milestone, moving a card to a milestone list will remove the previous value and replace it with the value of the list.\n\nThese are the attribute changes that will happen when moving issues between a milestone list and different one:\n\n##### To an from the backlog\n\n- Milestone -\u003e Backlog: Remove the milestone\n\n- Backlog -\u003e Milestone: Assign the milestone\n\n##### To and from a label list\n\n- Milestone -\u003e Label: Add the label\n\n- Label -\u003e Milestone: Assign the milestone\n\n##### To and from an assignee list\n\n- Milestone -\u003e Assignee: Assign the user\n\n- Assignee -\u003e Milestone: Assign the milestone\n\n##### To and from a milestone list\n\n- Milestone -\u003e Milestone: Remove the first milestone and assign the second one\n\n##### To and from the Closed list\n\n- Milestone -\u003e Closed: Close the issue\n\n- Closed -\u003e Milestone: Open and assign the milestone\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features

Overview\n\nCurrently, personal access `api` tokens do not have scoping at the project/group or functional level. This is problematic; this approach gives individual tokens too much power. A single `api` token applies to all projects on the instance, and we should limit the blast radius for individual tokens by allowing them to be scoped.\n\nIn this issue, we'll limit PATs to specific projects. PATs will still be attached to a particular user. This'll allow for use cases like a large organization with hundreds of projects designating a single bot user, and creating individual PATs for each of their projects. This increases security considerably, and allows us to limit misuse of an `api`-scoped token to a specific project.\n\nAfter this issue is complete, we'll continue to iterate with improvements like [limiting PATs to groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/45967) and [limiting the functional scope](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41165) of the `api` token.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the ability to limit API access by personal access tokens to specific projects when creating a token.\n\n* In `/profile/personal_access_tokens`, allow a user to optionally specify which project should be accessible when creating a PAT. A user should still be able to create a PAT scoped for all projects/groups.\n  * A user should be able to specify a single project or multiple projects.\n* The list of active Personal Access Tokens presented on this page should reflect the scope of the token (e.g. if applicable, the projects the PAT is scoped to).\n  * A user should be able to revoke from the list, as they're currently able.\n* Project-specific tokens should not be able to create, delete, or list SSH keys for the current user.\n\n| Default | Single project selected |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| ![image](/uploads/ef5640b490237d1c4862a4fd3f97403b/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/b3d5a04d352745a736c22c3dd2027749/image.png) |\n\n![image](/uploads/b2b8534e2dc0cf14f57bb46db659744e/image.png)\n\n**Changes introduced:**\n\n* changed the width of niput fields to better match the expected content (240px)\n* added a placeholder for the 'Expires at' input field to make it clear in what format the date is expected (`YYYY-MM-DD`)\n* added a calendar icon to the 'Expires at' input field to make it clear it's a datepicker\n* changed the font weight for checkbox labels to regular in 'Scopes'\n* explanatory text for 'Scopes' checkboxes needs to be in a new line and styled as help text\n* removed duplications of explanations in the last two checkboxes in 'Scopes'\n* added a new dropdown that defaults to 'All projects' but a single project can be selected (Project avatar, project name and project namespace are listed in the project selection dropdown)\n* added a new column 'Project(s)' to the 'Active personal access tokens' table. All existing tokens should have value 'All'\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n* Create `app/assets/javascripts/access_tokens/components/project_selector.vue`\n  * Use [`gl-token-selector`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-token-selector--default) to display the projects\n  * Use the GraphQL projects query with the [`membership`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/graphql/resolvers/projects_resolver.rb#L7) and [`search_namespaces`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/graphql/resolvers/projects_resolver.rb#L19) parameters to populate the token selector\n* Add a Vue application mount point (`.js-project-selector`) to [app/views/shared/access_tokens/_form.html.haml#L31](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/shared/access_tokens/_form.html.haml#L31)\n* Export a function that initializes the Vue app in [app/assets/javascripts/access_tokens/index.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/access_tokens/index.js)\n* Use that exported function in [app/assets/javascripts/pages/profiles/personal_access_tokens/index.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/pages/profiles/personal_access_tokens/index.js)\n* Add a new `td` for `Project(s)` in [app/views/shared/access_tokens/_table.html.haml#L45](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/shared/access_tokens/_table.html.haml#L45)\n\n### Note to engineer\n\nPlease check out this old MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/20332.

heavy solution with unintended side effects. Workspaces is another proposal for passing files between jobs. But sometimes you don't want to pass files at all, just a small bit of data.\n\n### Further details\n\nUse cases needing ability to pass information between jobs:\n*  you create a semantic version during build and want to pass it the deploy job\n*  you build a docker image and want to pass the ref to another job\n*  you have an error message that you want to pass to your Slack integration\n\n### Proposal\n\nConsidering that https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/17066 provided a workflow to pass custom variables to Rails via a `dotenv` artifact, in this MVC issue we want to allow passing data to other jobs.\n\nWe can use `needs` or `dependency` keywords by specifying dependencies of the jobs, which works on both DAG and Stage pipelines.\n\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - BUILD_VERSION=$(./build)                            # In script, you get a variable needs to be passed to the other jobs.\n    - echo \"BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION\" \u003e\u003e build.env    # Write the variable in dotenv file.\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: build.env                                   # Report back dotenv file to rails.\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - echo \"Build version is #{BUILD_VERSION}\"            # Consume the variable \n  dependencies:\n    - build\n  # Or, if you'd prepare to use DAG,\n  #\n  # needs:\n  #  - build\n  #\n  # Or, don't declare anything. All of the jobs in the previous stages are recognized as dependent automatically.\n```\n\n### Concerns\n\nOutstanding:\n- [ ] Clarify how it affects variable expansion in multiple places e.g. Expansion on Rails.\n\nAddressed:\n* On cross-project pipeline or parent-child pipelines, this feature works in the same way that \"artifact\" works.\n* If two variable keys are conflicted from different dotenv files, the system may select based on completion time of build; or by random selection.\n* If two jobs in a row update the dotenv file, or if two jobs provide two different ones, then each job has its dotenv file.\n\n\n### Technical proposal\n\nHere is pseudocode.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/models/concerns/ci/contextable.rb b/app/models/concerns/ci/contextable.rb\nindex 5ff537a7837..2c100ace5b8 100644\n--- a/app/models/concerns/ci/contextable.rb\n+++ b/app/models/concerns/ci/contextable.rb\n@@ -18,6 +18,7 @@ module Ci\n         variables.concat(deployment_variables(environment: environment))\n         variables.concat(yaml_variables)\n         variables.concat(user_variables)\n+        variables.concat(depended_variables)\n         variables.concat(secret_group_variables)\n         variables.concat(secret_project_variables(environment: environment))\n         variables.concat(trigger_request.user_variables) if trigger_request\n@@ -34,6 +35,16 @@ module Ci\n       scoped_variables.to_hash\n     end\n \n+    ##\n+    # Inherit variables from dependencies, which specified via `job:needs` or `job:dependencies`\n+    # in .gitlab-ci.yml.\n+    # TODO: Batch-load\n+    def depended_variables\n+      ([self] + dependencies).map do |dependency|\n+        Ci::JobArtifacts::List::Dotenv.new(dependency).load\n+      end\n+    end\n+\n     ##\n     # Variables that do not depend on the environment name.\n     #\n```\n\n### Links / references\n\n* https://buddy.works/blog/new-feature-passing-parameters\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose?

up a Snowplow JS tracker for pageviews on GitLab.com","description":"### Description\n\nWe'd like to use [Snowplow](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow) for tracking pageviews and events on GitLab.com. In Snowplow, trackers fire events, which are received and logged by collectors. Trackers send data to collectors by making a `GET` request for a tracking pixel. This issue sets up these JavaScript trackers on GitLab.com. \n\nThis issue is dependent on a collector endpoint, which is being tracked in this TBC issue.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn order to follow the asynchronous integration steps in https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/integrating-javascript-tags-onto-your-website, we need to be able to install a script into the `\u003chead\u003e` for all pages on the GitLab.com instance. \n\n### Additional\n\nThe script in Snowplow's documentation includes `window.snowplow('trackPageView');`, which should yield pageview tracking for all pages on GitLab.com. \n\nAdditionally:\n* We should self-host our `sp.js` and point to it instead of using Snowplow Analytics' hosted copy. This issue is tracked here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47810.\n  * Snowplow's hosted copy is probably OK for testing and staging, but we should probably host our own before this hits production.\n\n### Collector endpoint\n\nhttps://snowplow.trx.gitlab.net\n\n### Links / references\n* Meta issue for setting up Snowplow on GitLab.com:

Then, users will access Geo through a common name/load balancer. The load balancer intelligently routes the user to the closest Geo node. This is useful in large enterprises because users don't need to know where the Geo nodes are or what their specific URL is. \n\nThis currently doesn't work with Geo due to OAuth. When attempting to authenticate via the load balanced name, OAuth fails with 'Invalid URI' on the GitLab primary. However, authentication works fine when accessing a specific Geo node via it's proper URL. This seems to be due to the way we do name matching. \n\nIs there a way we can match the secondary instance during authentication and support this use-case?\n\nI mentioned this to @nick.thomas in #geo. Nick, do you have any further thoughts on this?\n\n\n### Closing summary\n\nWe have at least 2 options:\n\n- Support alternative OAuth redirect URL (so the load balancer address can be added): https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9142\n- Decouple the Geo node identity from `external_url`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9174\n  -

The Docker image runs on Linux systems and it integrates with SAST but it suffers from a major limitation: it only contains .NET Core. Most projects need the .NET Framework in order to compile.\n\nThere's a Docker image that contains the .NET Framework but it requires a Windows system: https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-framework\n\n### Proposal\n\nAssuming that customers already have GitLab Runners deployed on Windows servers, and that they've configured a CI job that builds the .NET project, make it possible to run SAST for .NET from within that build job. This involves:\n\n- Build a Windows-compatible binary the users can install and run on their CI servers.\n- Write some documentation on how to install and execute the binary in order to generate SAST artifacts.\n- Determine if there are multiple `.csproj` files in the repo and be able to support the case of one or more than one\n\nIdeally we'd provide a Nuget package that would depend on `SecurityCodeScan` and generate the artifact automatically when building the .NET project.\n\n### Tasks\n\n- [x] Determine golang support for older windows server versions so we can clearly communicate which versions of windows server are supported. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/205908#note_322707008 for more info.\n- [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/webgoat.net/pipelines/132790703/security shows that running on windows may result in paths in the findings look to be duplicated: (e.g. \"File:\nC:\\Users\\dsearles\\builds\\jEPGiVGF\\0\\gitlab-org\\security-products\\tests\\webgoat.net\\WebGoat\\ C:\\Users\\dsearles\\builds\\jEPGiVGF\\0\\gitlab-org\\security-products\\tests\\webgoat.net\\WebGoat\\App_Code\\CookieManager.cs:18\")\n- [x] Document how to use SAST for .NET Framework on the shared windows runners\n\n### Windows Version Support\n\nWindows version support per golang version is found at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Windows\n\nAs of writing this out, the latest version of golang is 1.14.2. We should not upgrade past that without checking for any changes in which versions of Windows are supported.\n\n| **Distributions**                         | **Architectures** | **Initial support

Currently on GitLab.com, a user is able to auth into a SAML-enabled group and use their pre-existing personal account. \n\nWhile they lose access to any connected groups when they're deprovisioned, there's still a desire to keep these two sets of credentials separate. Thus, when the user moves on from the company/their contract expires, they simply lose access to the dedicated account.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a setting for a SSO-connected group, that when enabled:\n* When a user SSOs into the group, we check for a link between a user and that specific group.\n  1. If that link does not exist, the user must [create a new user](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5292). After registration has been completed, we establish this link between the new user and the group.\n  1. If that link does exist (the user is associated with the group), allow the user access to the group or requested resource.\n* If a dedicated user is removed from the linked group, they should not be able to log into GitLab.com with that account.\n\nIf the group already exists (and has never turned this option on), all members of the group will be required to create new users. When enabling this setting for an existing group, we should warn the user making the change of this consequence (e.g. \"all X members of your group will be required to create unique accounts\").\n\n### Solution\n\n| SAML disabled | SAML enabled | Enforce SSO enabled | Group managed accounts enabled |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| ![image](/uploads/cc72733db2f90daffd9598bbddd1f821/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/b140333d6e81da57a58a4b325a764b91/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/d3230fbc8897cab0370be386d8e06847/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/156e2ab288da977fd9540718e671ceb3/image.png) |","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-31T19:47:00.098Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:34:14.998Z","closed_at":"2019-04-24T13:38:23.176Z","closed_by":{"id":750946,"username":"dennis","name":"Dennis Tang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/750946/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dennis"},"labels":["Category:Subgroups","Category:User Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","Manage [DEPRECATED]","backend","devops::manage","gitlab.com","missed-deliverable","missed:11.9","priority::1","researched [DEPRECATED]","saml","type::feature","workflow::in dev","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":655280,"iid":28,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.11","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-21T19:08:37.027Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T14:39:00.009Z","due_date":"2019-05-22","start_date":"2019-04-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/28"},"assignees":[{"id":1859215,"username":"matejlatin","name":"Matej Latin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1859215/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matejlatin"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1859215,"username":"matejlatin","name":"Matej Latin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1859215/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/matejlatin"},"user_notes_count":38,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6260","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6260","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6260/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6260/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6260","relative":"#6260","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6260"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":709,"epic":{"id":3015,"iid":709,"title":"Group managed accounts for Group SSO","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/709","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":11141754,"iid":6259,"project_id":278964,"title":"External auth access denied reason is not shown","description":"According to the documentation, if an external authorization denies access a reason can be provided to be shown to the user.

In GitLab 14.10, you can now specify multiple jobs with the on_stop keyword in your `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file that run in parallel when closing an environment to enable more complex environment teardown procedures.\n\n### Description\n\nIt would be beneficial if it was possible to define multiple `on_stop` hooks for any given environment within `.gitlab-ci.yaml`. According to my tests, if you have multiple jobs defining `on_stop` for the same environment, only the last one defined is used once the environment is being torn down (eg. the corresponding branch is deleted).\n\nOur deployment pipelines have a `deploy` stage, which contains multiple jobs:\n\n- Deploying our containers to Kubernetes using Helm, using the `devth/helm` image for running the job.\n- Provisioning DNS records in Cloudflare for the deployment using Terraform, using the `hashicorp/terraform` image for running the job.\n\nOur goal was then to have each of these `deploy` jobs define a corresponding teardown-job so that we - in this example - would have one teardown-job running `helm delete` using the `devth/helm` image, and one running `terraform destroy` using the `hashicorp/terraform` image.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAll `on_stop` hooks for any given environment are collected and run in parallel or succession when the environment is being stopped.\n\n#### Alternate proposal considered\n\n`on_stop` could take in a list of jobs to run when the environment is being stopped, instead of just one.

chart","description":"- Currently, if an issue is created in the middle of a milestone, the burndown chart considers it to have been created at the beginning of the milestone. This is a simplifying assumption. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/burndown_charts.html and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/91#algorithm.\n- The change here accounts for this case more explicitly, so that if an issue is created in the middle of a milestone, the chart line will move up, as expected.\n\n### Algorithm / scenarios\n\n- Assume all dates/times are with \"day\" granularity.\n- Assume each issue has `closed_at`, and it gets updated every time the issue is closed.\n- Suppose I am looking at a given day, call it `d`, and that `milestone-start-date \u003c= d \u003c= milestone-end-date`, which we only care about for the purpose of generating the chart. Note that `d` has no relation to `now`. We can be looking at milestones in the past, present, or future.\n- We only generate the chart from `milestone-start-date` to `now`.\n- Suppose I am looking at a given issue `i` that has the associated milestone with it. I only care about issues with this milestone.\n- Note that `i.created_at \u003c= i.closed_at \u003c= now` by the logic of issues. An issue can be closed and re-opened many times. But `i.created_at` is the first time it is open. `i.closed_at` stores the latest day it has been closed.\n\n| Scenario (For given `d` in the chart) | User-facing interpretation and assumption | Technical logic (Count/weight the issue?) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `d \u003c i.created_at` | `i` necessarily does not exist on all of `d` | No  |\n| `i.created_at \u003c= d \u003c i.closed_at` | Assume `i` open on all of `d`, ignoring any possible closes and reopens in between `i.created_at` and `i.closed_at` | Yes |\n| `d = i.closed_at` | `i` closed on `d` and assume it is closed on all of `d` | No |\n| `i.closed_at \u003c d \u003c= now \u0026\u0026 i.state(now) = closed` | `i` necessarily is closed from `i.closed_at` until now | No |\n| `i.closed_at \u003c d \u003c= now \u0026\u0026 i.state(now) = open` | Assume `i` reopened on `i.closed_at + 1` | Yes |","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-24T16:22:51.102Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:30:39.046Z","closed_at":"2018-10-05T15:56:27.063Z","closed_by":{"id":443319,"username":"smcgivern","name":"Sean McGivern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/443319/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/smcgivern"},"labels":["Enterprise Edition","GitLab Starter","Stretch","backend","devops::plan","milestones","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":567670,"iid":19,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.4","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-14T17:31:41.249Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T06:49:55.749Z","due_date":"2018-10-22","start_date":"2018-09-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/19"},"assignees":[{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"}],"author":{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6174","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6174","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6174/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6174/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6174","relative":"#6174","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6174"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24663532,"iid":22406,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update existing public projects in private groups to private projects","description":"### Overview\n\nAs noted in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22406#note_215157441, the changes made to visibility only applied to newly created groups; existing groups weren't migrated, causing intermittent errors.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMigrate all existing public projects in private groups to be private projects.\n\n### Error in Sentry\n\nhttps://sentry.gitlap.com/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/198603/\n\n```\nActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Visibility level private is not allowed since this group contains projects with higher visibility.\n  active_record/validations.rb:79:in `raise_record_invalid'\n    raise(RecordInvalid.new(self))\n  active_record/validations.rb:43:in `save!'\n    perform_validations(options) ?

Creating a cluster on EKS is difficult for first time users.\n\n### Further details\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/create-cluster.html\n\nIt looks like `eksctl create cluster` takes care of everything, including adding nodes: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html (edited)\n\nIdentity providers and federation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html\n\n### Proposal\n\nProvide a tight integration with EKS where users can create clusters from the GitLab GUI (similar to GKE)\n\n#### Pre-requisites:\n\n1.  User creates an IAM Policy that grants access to the required resources (read VPC, create cluster, nodes etc). GitLab will provide example JSON for this.\n1. User creates an IAM Cross Account Role, adding the GitLab AWS account ID as a trusted entity and the policy above for permissions.\n\n#### User Flow\n\n1. User to enter the *Role ARN* and *External ID* generated in the pre-requisites step into the cluster form. These cannot be changed once set (for now).\n2. GitLab provisions a dedicated service account for this cluster in the GitLab AWS account, and grants permissions to assume the role above.\n3. GitLab (frontend) uses the service account to assume the role, and fills-in/validates the remaining fields in the cluster form.\n4. User completes the cluster form and submits it.\n - Cluster name\n - Kubernetes version (default to latest)\n - Region\n - Role Name (select existing)\n - VPC (select existing)\n - subnets (auto fill from VPC)\n - security group (auto fill from VPC)\n5. GitLab (backend) uses the service account to assume the role, and can provision the cluster. From here it is the same process as a GKE cluster (poll to check progress etc)\n\n6. Update cluster creation screen to provide two options\n * Create on cloud provider\n * Add existing cluster\n\n7. Once users select the new \"Create on cloud provider\" option, the flow for GKE will be the same as it is now.\n\n8. Cluster should have public access enabled by default so GitLab can interact with it.\n\n# Solution\n\nUser is able to select between GKE and EKS:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2019-07-12_at_2.59.55_PM](/uploads/09be80343f516fb3cb3da8689f235846/Screen_Shot_2019-07-12_at_2.59.55_PM.png)\n\nSVGs:\n* [amazon-eks.svg](/uploads/e1c3d4405b8730cd607aaef0ab855ef2/amazon-eks.svg)\n* [google-gke.svg](/uploads/b1f26040515815b6f3ab457c7fbbe2ca/google-gke.svg)\n\n---\n\nThe user would choose AWS from the first screen and we would keep them on that page but transition the content to be a form field that would allow them to input the necessary account details (instead of navigating away as we do with signing in to google). On that screen we can include a link to the docs that details how to get the necessary information (creating a service account) needed to provide credentials.\n\n![img](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/372eca671d5b22779e6a635db851f4be/Screen_Shot_2019-10-04_at_12.05.27_PM.png)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eprevious solution that involves logging in via AWS - this not a possible option.\u003c/summary\u003e\nClicking either would take the user to the screen to authorize application permissions:\n\n|Google|Amazon|\n|--|--|\n|![Screen_Shot_2019-07-12_at_3.01.56_PM](/uploads/9c138065170d5936353617ba680b9de5/Screen_Shot_2019-07-12_at_3.01.56_PM.png) | ![amazon-auth](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/DeveloperBlogs/AlexaBlogs/default/account_linking_image_10.jpg._CB480128846_.jpg)|\n\nThis essentially removes the \"login with google\" button.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n---\n\nFrom there, the user sees the fields necessary to create the EKS cluster.\n\nCopy for fields:\n\n\u003e **Kubernetes cluster name**\n\u003e\n\u003e [ ]\n\n\u003e **Environment scope**\n\u003e\n\u003e [ * ]\n\u003e\n\u003e Choose which of your environments will use this cluster.\n\n\u003e **Kubernetes version**\n\u003e\n\u003e [ 1.13 ]\n\u003e\n\u003e Select the Kubernetes version to install.\n\n\u003e **Role name**\n\u003e\n\u003e [ Select role name ˅ ]\n\u003e \n\u003e Select the IAM Role to allow Amazon EKS and the Kubernetes control plane to manage AWS resources on your behalf.

Next time I want to create a protected branch the last selected user is pre-selected, even if it is on a different project to which that user does not belong. This is quite annoying, especially with many users where one has to scroll the list at least twice: once to deselect, another time to select.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn a project with some users as members, create a protected branch (not the branch itself, just the protection) and give some permission to some user(s).\n\nCreate another protected branch.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe user(s) selected for the previous protected branch are pre-selected.\n\nAlso, selecting \"No one\", does not deselect the users. So if one has \"1 user\" and selects \"No one\", the result is \"1 role, 1 user\". This is quite unintuitive and it's not even clear what it means.\n\nThis happens in Firefox 56.0 at least.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nEither start with nothing selected, or with some default setting (maybe \"Masters\" only, or make it configurable by project).\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on

reproduce\n\n1. Go to `New Project` and `Import project`\n\n1. Choose and login to Bitbucket or GitHub.\n\n1. Check the dropdown menu under \"To GitLab\". \n\n### Example Project\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n1. It displays the Bitbucket/GitHub username as an option to add as a group namespace, but there is no indication that is what is happening. \n\n1. If the user already has a group with the same name, it will appear twice on the group list. \n\n1. There is no indication if the namespace is unavailable, and attempts to import into that namespace gives generic errors only.\n\n1. If the user doesn't have any groups on GitLab, the dropdown menu will be disabled and not give the option to create a group with the Bitbucket/GitHub username.\n\n1. When importing from Bitbucket, it creates the group, but errors before project imports.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n1. Indication that a new group will be created with the Bitbucket/GitHub username on import if that option is selected.\n\n1. Should only appear once and/or groups already on GitLab should be listed separately.\n\n1. Should show if namespace is already taken and/or should display an error with actual information.\n\n1. Dropdown should still work.\n\n1. No errors on import. \n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nThe namespace are listed twice since group exists with no info on which is which.\n![lists_twice](/uploads/f3600e6ce930f6d0bc936c8ab2212909/lists_twice.png)\n\nUser without any groups has the dropdown disabled.\n![no_group](/uploads/fdaa67ebc7b29ef7e9eb02d7602047c4/no_group.png)\n\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n`GitLab Enterprise Edition 10.8.0-rc12-ee `\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-19T18:36:58.672Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T03:04:14.478Z","closed_at":"2021-12-20T03:04:14.462Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["Bitbucket","Category:Importers","DEPRECATED_project import","Github","Importer:GitHub","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto closed","devops::manage","frontend","gitlab.com","good for new contributors","group::import","movingtogitlab","priority::3","section::dev","severity::3","stale","type::bug","type::feature","vintage"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Also, PoC was first implemented in this [CodePen example](https://codepen.io/kushalpandya/pen/eQbMEX) for easier iteration and review between frontend and UX, and then was ported over to the MR once we had acceptable layout.\n\n#### Screenshots\n\n|**Mobile**|**Tablet / Mobile Landscape**|**Medium Desktop**|**Large Desktop**|\n|----------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n|![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e48715ecceee9319ef15826ece09e446/image.png)|![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/a18c21b47724673d0d3ff6e8202f0864/image.png)|![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/2b20197b1b43cc0be0afdccc7cba786d/image.png)|![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/4293b867734c3857e4546f56ad91f263/image.png)|\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-18T19:53:33.610Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T16:30:36.380Z","closed_at":"2018-12-08T09:58:52.018Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Category:Portfolio Management","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","devops::plan","direction","epics","frontend","issues","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":569990,"iid":21,"group_id":9970,"title":"11.6","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-16T19:56:12.651Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T21:40:29.892Z","due_date":"2018-12-22","start_date":"2018-11-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/21"},"assignees":[{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},{"id":426128,"username":"felipe_artur","name":"Felipe Artur","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dbad92659914f56621cbdd726e283e60?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/felipe_artur"},{"id":626804,"username":"pedroms","name":"Pedro Moreira da Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c306f087d191ac15549f3c11e3bed321?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pedroms"}],"author":{"id":711023,"username":"victorwu","name":"Victor Wu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/711023/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/victorwu"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":411701,"username":"kushalpandya","name":"Kushal Pandya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/411701/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kushalpandya"},"user_notes_count":36,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6086","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6086","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6086/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/6086/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6086","relative":"#6086","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#6086"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":406,"epic":{"id":1183,"iid":406,"title":"Better lists for related issues / epics / mrs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/406","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 22, 2019","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24663378,"iid":22320,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make CI/CD features easier to test in GDK","description":"It's very hard to test almost any feature in CI/CD in GDK.

Add `X dismissed vulnerabilities` or `, X dismissed,` depending on location, to the string in security reports and the MR widget. \n1.
