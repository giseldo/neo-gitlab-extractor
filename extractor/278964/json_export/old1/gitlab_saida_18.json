item. When the work item is deleted, the checklist item is also removed. \n\nChecklist items and work items should generally be decoupled — checking the checkmark in the checklist item doesn't affect the task, and vice versa. Users deleting a work item are only saying \"I no longer need this work item\", not necessarily that they want to remove the checklist item.\n\nAs we move toward automatically creating work items without a \"Save\" action, deletion becomes more important to remedy accidental actions (in effect it becomes your \"Cancel\" action). Replacing the checklist item with the original text will better support users who decide against using a work item.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIdeal path: reset the checklist item to just text of the task title\n\nAcceptable path: retain the checklist item in linked form, even though link will be to a deleted item and result in a 404 (this mirrors current state legacy issue behavior).","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-09T13:48:09.288Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T12:00:48.737Z","closed_at":"2022-07-18T21:47:54.059Z","closed_by":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe Weaver","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303289/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gweaver"},"labels":["Deliverable","SUS::Impacting","UX","devops::plan","group::project management","maintenance::usability","section::dev","severity::3","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"}],"author":{"id":11392688,"username":"nickleonard","name":"Nick Leonard","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11392688/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nickleonard"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3483274,"username":"acroitor","name":"Alexandru Croitor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/461378ef52c26eec55e6c15ec09bb9ed?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/acroitor"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364807","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/364807","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/364807/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/364807/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#364807","relative":"#364807","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#364807"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8297,"epic":{"id":552836,"iid":8297,"title":"Tasks Short Term Cleanup","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8297","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":109842237,"iid":364795,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add link-name to Vulnerability Details","description":"## Summary\n\nAs part of the pipeline'security tab's migration to GraphQL we want to use a shared component [^1] for rendering a vulnerability's and pipeline-finding's modal details:\n\n| modal using shared details component (behind `:pipeline_security_dashboard_graphql` feature flag) |\n| ------ |\n| ![details](/uploads/02c317d3c8c5bcb6f5057c5e59980a8a/details.png) |\n\nThe current version of finding's modal contains a link-name, but the shared component only uses the url as the link-text:\n\n| modal current version -

The below scenario illustrates the problem:\n\n#### Import all repositories\n1. User authenticates their GitHub account. :slight_smile: \n1. Selects \"Import 234 repositories\" from the `Import repositories from GitHub` page which initiates the import. :slight_smile: \n1. User realizes they had made a mistake and needs to cancel their import and correct the error. :confused: \n1. User finds no way to cancel the import. :rage: \n1. User must go into GitLab project settings for each imported project and delete them manually. :weary: \n\nThis process is quite cumbersome and could cause a lot of frustration for the users.\n\n# Proposal\n\nAllow the user to cancel imports once a project import has been initiated.\n\n**View the Figma file for the user flow:**  \n:eye: [User flow for canceling project imports](https://www.figma.com/file/WRpBznfNzkGruiIAINxFRv/Canceling-Project-Imports?node-id=0%3A1)\n\n**View the Figma prototype for:**  \n:eye:  [Cancel all project imports](https://www.figma.com/proto/WRpBznfNzkGruiIAINxFRv/Canceling-Project-Imports?node-id=180%3A4678\u0026scaling=min-zoom)  \n:eye:  [Cancel single project imports](https://www.figma.com/proto/WRpBznfNzkGruiIAINxFRv/Canceling-Project-Imports?node-id=143%3A36057\u0026scaling=min-zoom)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n# Notes\nCanceling should be service agnostic if possible so we can use it for services other than GitHub.\n\nMetrics on how often the feature is used are desirable.

replicas","description":"## Problem\n\nFrom:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-06-09_at_3.55.16_pm](/uploads/410e9c33861f4e180908b7cb195773ab/Screen_Shot_2022-06-09_at_3.55.16_pm.png)\n\n[source](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/alerts-sat_pgb_client_conn_replicas/alerts-pgbouncer_client_conn_replicas-saturation-detail?orgId=1\u0026from=now-7d\u0026to=now)\n\nwe can see that we are reaching ~60% saturation of client connections during peak hours.\n\nThese client connections are from GitLab rails processes to PGBouncer processes running on the Patroni nodes.\n\nThis 60% saturation is despite the fact that there is plenty of headroom with the large number of Patroni replicas we have.\n\nThis problem cannot be fixed by adding more PGBouncer processes nor by adding more replica nodes (even though both of these should be theoretically horizontally scalable). This problem (as I'll explain) is caused by an architectural decision we made in the rails application that we can and should fix before start saturating connections.\n\nWe also noticed this problem recently in this incident https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7139 . We learnt not to try that again but still it showed that there is a bottleneck waiting for us in future.\n\n### How the problem occurs in detail\n\nThere is a good summary of our architecture at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/pgbouncer/patroni-consul-postgres-pgbouncer-interactions.md .\n\nGiven our current architecture each rails processes starts up and queries Consul DNS service for `db-replica.service.consul`. It gets back a result for every PGBouncer on every replica node. Each replica node contains 3 pgbouncers. So if there are 8 replicas then this is 8x3=24 results. Now Rails opens up a connection pool to every one of these PGBouncers. Thus 24 connection pools. For the [pool size it uses the number of threads](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/client_side_connection_pool.html) of the Rails process. So if we assume we run Puma with 50 threads then each rails process is opening 50*24 = 1200 connections to pgbouncers.\n\nWhen we see spikes in traffic our K8s cluster autoscales up the number of rails pods. If we have 1000 rails pods then this is 1200*1000 = 1.2M connections to PGBouncer.\n\nClient connections to PGBouncer are generally cheap except we have a problem that PGBouncer runs single threaded so we have a [hardcoded limit of 20k connections per pgbouncer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo/-/blob/8b0c6582d93ad800c1f423f4bc76fac7b37f52b4/roles/gprd-base-db-patroni.json#L35).\n\nAnd we can't fix this problem by just spinning up more pgbouncers because each rails process will see this as another server and just create more connections.\n\nSo ultimately we will reach saturation when GitLab.com traffic is high enough that the number of K8s pods needed to keep up with traffic exceeds a certain number. The limit of the number of pods we can run would be:\n\n```\n20000 / num_threads_per_pod\n```\n\n### Note on CI Decomposition\n\nThis problem is not improved nor made worse by CI decomposition. CI decomposition means that each rails process is actually creating a set of connection pools for `main` and `ci` so it's actually doubling the number of client connections from our rails processes. But these new client connections are also going to a separate set of PGBouncers/Patroni hosts so they don't bring us closer to the 20k limit.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe are being tremendously wasteful with how we open up connections. We, however, cannot simply just reduce the pool sizes because there is a risk that one pool is the most up to date and the rails process needs 1 connection per thread in a single pool.\n\nOne solution might be to put a limit on the number of replicas each rails process can connect to. Such that if there are more than 10 replicas available to a rails process it will randomly choose 10 of those replicas. This would mean that each rails process is only ever creating at most 10*num_threads client connections and then we can now increase the number of replicas or number of pgbouncers without increasing the number of client connections.\n\nThis solution is likely sufficient when all replicas are keeping up to date but it might occasionally mean some rails process are unlucky and get a set of replicas that quite far behind and this will be inefficient because Rails will use those replicas less as it determines if a replica is up to date enough for a given workload (user). Solving that problem may require a more sophisticated approach to deciding which replicas to connect to or how to size connection pools for each replica.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-09T06:11:14.153Z","updated_at":"2022-11-27T16:04:36.494Z","closed_at":"2022-11-24T22:20:55.686Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"labels":["Category:Database","devops::data_stores","group::database","missed:15.3","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","section::enablement","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"user_notes_count":29,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368625","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/368625","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/368625/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/368625/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#368625","relative":"#368625","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#368625"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":109818884,"iid":364747,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `web_hooks_rate_limit_paid_exclusions`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337228) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `web_hooks_rate_limit_paid_exclusions` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::integrations\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_ecosystem_integrations`\n- Best individual to reach out to: `@.luke`\n- PM: `@g.hickman` \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe the expected outcome when rolling out this feature --\u003e\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\n\u003c!-- What are the settings we need to configure in order to have this feature viable? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- \nExample below:\n \n1.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel.

They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nThis issue provides the implementation plan for a service component for storing sbom data in the database.\n\n## Relevant links\n\nThis is part of a wider epic to add SBOM ingestion: gitlab-org\u00268024 \n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\n- [ ] Documentation: tbd\n- [ ] Feature flag: tbd\n- [ ] Performance:\n  - [ ] Ensure that this service remains performant with large reports (10,000+ components)\n- [ ] Testing: tbd\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nWe will make use of [`BulkInsertableTask`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1765db362f96e820897af8483ac7a6c4810644b1/ee/app/services/security/ingestion/bulk_insertable_task.rb#L27) in order to create records in batches.\n\nCreate `Sbom::Ingestion::IngestReportsService`\n\n1. Take `Gitlab::Ci::Reports::Sbom::Reports` as an argument (added via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366194)\n2. Create an `Sbom::Ingestion::ComponentMap` and `Sbom::Ingestion::ComponentMapCollection`\n   1. A component map holds a set of related models (pipeline, source, component, version, occurrence)\n   2. A component map collection holds a set of component maps\n   3. Models are initialized from a `Reports` object\n   4. When performing insertions, models will be mapped over in order to collect data for subsequent insertions (foreign keys)\n3. Step through the following ingestions tasks. Each task will get data from the report object, convert it into the a model, and perform a bulk insert or upsert. Bulk upserts will skip over items which already have a row matching the `unique_by` fields. This lets us efficiently perform `create if not exists` operations.\n   1. `IngestSbomComponents`, Bulk upsert, `unique_by: :name`\n   2. `IngestSbomComponentVersions`, Bulk upsert, `unique_by: :component_id, :version`\n   3. `IngestSbomSources`, Bulk upsert, `unique_by: :fingerprint`\n   4. `IngestSbomOccurrences`, Bulk insert\n\n## Verification steps\n\u003c!--\nAdd verification steps to help GitLab team members test the implementation. This is particularly useful\nduring the MR review and the ~\"workflow::verification\" step. You may not know exactly what the\nverification steps should be during issue refinement, so you can always come back later to add\nthem.\n\n1. Check-out the corresponding branch\n1. ...\n1. Profit!\n--\u003e\n\n1. Enable the feature flag on your project (please comment / tick this in [the feature flag rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367711))\n2. Create a new project from a template, use the NodeJS/Express template. Make sure that the group which you create this project under has an ultimate plan. \n3. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with this configuration:\n\n    ```yaml\n    include:\n      - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n    gemnasium-dependency_scanning:\n      # Needed until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/99126 is on production\n      artifacts:\n        reports:\n          cyclonedx: \"**/gl-sbom-*.cdx.json\"\n    ```\n\n4. Verify that the `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` outputs a `gl-sbom-npm-npm.cdx.json` artifact\n5. [Use teleport to connect to the db console](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/Teleport/Connect_to_Database_Console_via_Teleport.md). For production, this will require an access request, but this will be automatically sent to the `#infrastructure-lounge` channel when you run `tsh login` and is usually approved very quickly.\n6. Take this query an paste it inside an editor. Replace `YOUR_PIPELINE_ID` with the ID of your CI pipeline which produced the `gl-sbom-npm-npm.cdx.json` artifact.\n\n   ```sql\n   select\n     name, version, component_type, source_id\n   from\n     sbom_components\n   inner join sbom_component_versions\n     on sbom_components.id = sbom_component_versions.component_id\n   inner join sbom_occurrences\n     on sbom_component_versions.id = sbom_occurrences.component_version_id\n   where pipeline_id = YOUR_PIPELINE_ID;\n   ```\n\n7. Paste the query with your pipeline ID into the database console.

insights must recommend an action that needs to take place. An actionable insight both defines the insight and clearly calls out action or next step required to improve based on the result of the research observation or data. Actionable insights are tracked over time and will include follow-up. Please follow the tasks outlined in this issue for best results. Learn more in the handbook here: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/research-insights/#actionable-insights \n\nThis issue template is for an actionable insight that requires a change in the product.--\u003e\n\n### Insight\nUsers go to the Environments page to check how their deployments are doing -- for example, troubleshoot a failed deployment, see the last successful deployment and rollback, share that information with their teams, and identify dependancies. Because that information is missing or is difficult to find, some participants navigate to the Pipelines page instead to see a complete list of previous deployments and their commits for an environment.\n\nToday, users can copy a SHA but cannot click to go and check the information about the commit pipeline.\n\nUsers can see the link to the pipeline commit in the UI, but that text is usually a generic text that reads `Merge branch `abcd into efgh`... and is not relevant to them if the deployment is always pointing to production.\n\n### Supporting evidence\n\u003c!-- Describe why the problem is happening, or more details behind the finding or observation. Try to include quotes or specific data collected. Feel free to link the Actionable insight from Dovetail here if applicable instead of retyping details. --\u003e\n\n\u003e None of this is links, I think is it used to be, I mean, the commit should obviously be a link\n\n\u003e Again, quickly navigate not having to search for stuff. It's I know it's I know it's there. I want to quickly know what was in that commit. Oh yeah. I want a good site commit and then compare to previous type of previous version or something quickly Because I always go, I'm often on this page. It's pretty much always open on my computer. I ever really used it at all. Even though we don't have that many environments, I do use it all. \n\n\u003e This is what I expect to see which the problem, when, which branch, which commit, who deployed it\n\n\u003e  I use that page to see a development has the new dashboard on it. And it's that commit deployed at that time. That's what I'm interested in basically.\n\n### Action\n\u003c!--Since this is an actionable insight that requires a change in the product, ensure the action is algned to that. Describe the next step or action that needs to take place as a result of the research. The action should be clearly defined, achievable, and directly tied back to the insight.

Have the field initially disabled globally\n1. Update helper text to explain why its disabled\n   - Helper text copy: `Editing IP addresses is disabled and can be enabled by a GitLab administrator.`\n   - There are two scenarios to deal with for informing the user why they can't edit the IP Allowlist\n       - **Scenario A**: The feature to edit IP addresses via UI disabled but the group has IP addresses in list.\n       - **Scenario B**: The feature to edit IP addresses via UI disabled and **no** IP addresses were ever set.\n1.

- Add sbom command to gemnasium analyzers","description":"### Proposal\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to add a new `sbom` command to the `gemnasium` analyzer projects, as an MVC for creating SBOM generator projects.\n\nThe logic for this new `sbom` command should be shared between the 3 analyzers, and will be be similar to the current [run command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/9b6cfb45c895a361aea8f7d5c360d5d972a5e7e0/cmd/gemnasium/main.go#L143-299), however, it will only be capable of exporting `cyclonedx-*.json` files.\n\nAs part of this issue, we'll also need to add tests to check the `sbom` command in the following integration tests:\n\n- [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/251e59d/spec/gemnasium_image_spec.rb#L1-1)\n-

[gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/251e59d/spec/gemnasium-python_image_spec.rb#L1-1)\n\nThese tests should call `/analyzer sbom` and ensure that the expected `gl-sbom-*.cdx.json` files are created.\n\n/cc @fcatteau @sam.white

NPM projects with dependency scanning respect the option to [include or exclude devDependencies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/scanner/parser/npm/lockfile.go#L96). This was done to provide the ability to view what issues exist only within production. For Poetry, this would be the results of production installs i.e. `poetry install --no-dev`. This issue aims to bring optional development dependency inclusion to Poetry dependency scanning.\n\nFor additional context, the Poetry package manager propagates the `dev` context when resolving transitive dependencies. This is supported by the [pyproject.toml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-poetry/-/blob/46853c8ac0233ac23f8487dd6e0d126f755c83a8/pyproject.toml) and [poetry.lock](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-poetry/-/blob/46853c8ac0233ac23f8487dd6e0d126f755c83a8/poetry.lock) found in the python-poetry project.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340172) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_create_code-review`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set paginated_mr_discussions 25 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set paginated_mr_discussions 50 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set paginated_mr_discussions 75 --actors`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set paginated_mr_discussions 100 --actors`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set paginated_mr_discussions true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340172) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete paginated_mr_discussions --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete paginated_mr_discussions --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete paginated_mr_discussions`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue]() to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [x] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `paginated_mr_discussions`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior.

Team`:\n\n[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nHello,\n\nGroup Maintainers are able to toggle the package and registries settings using this missing permission check.\n\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Login as Group owner and go to `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cGroupName\u003e/-/settings/packages_and_registries`. You should be able to toggle all the settings from here.\n\n2. Now login as maintainer in a group and navigate to same url `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cGroupName\u003e/-/settings/packages_and_registries` but  you wont be able to access it.\n\n3. Now run the below Graphql to toggle `Settings for Maven packages` duplicates.\n\n```  \nPOST /api/graphql HTTP/2  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nCookie: 1  \nContent-Length: 501  \nX-Gitlab-Feature-Category: package_registry  \nX-Csrf-Token: 1  \nSec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/101.0.0.0 Safari/537.36  \nContent-Type: application/json  \nAccept: */*  \nSec-Ch-Ua-Platform: \"macOS\"  \nSec-Ch-Ua: \" Not A;Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Chromium\";v=\"101\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"101\"  \nOrigin: https://gitlab.com  \nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin  \nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors  \nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty  \nReferer: https://gitlab.com/groups/qqqq6/-/settings/packages_and_registries  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\n\n[{\"operationName\":\"updateNamespacePackageSettings\",\"variables\":{\"input\":{\"namespacePath\":\"qqqq6\",\"mavenDuplicatesAllowed\":true}},\"query\":\"mutation updateNamespacePackageSettings($input: UpdateNamespacePackageSettingsInput!) {\\n  updateNamespacePackageSettings(input: $input) {\\n    packageSettings {\\n      mavenDuplicatesAllowed\\n      mavenDuplicateExceptionRegex\\n      genericDuplicatesAllowed\\n      genericDuplicateExceptionRegex\\n      __typename\\n    }\\n    errors\\n    __typename\\n  }\\n}\\n\"}]  \n```  \n***Change namespacePath in above query*\n\n4.

The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations.

However, that integration is currently being updated, and we're not sure if/how those updates will support incident responders. Further, our SRE team has created their own Slack integration for incidents, called Woodhouse. The current state leaves us with a lot of questions about how to better support incident responders who are using Slack within GitLab, like:\n\n- Will incident responders be adequately supported by the updated GitLab Slack integration?\n- Should we use - or build on top of - the GitLab Slack application for incidents?\n- Should we instead \"productize\" some version of Woodhouse for incident responders?\n- Should we continue incrementally updating what we have?\n\nBecause there are so many outstanding questions, it's difficult to determine how to proceed with making improvements to the Slack-to-GitLab workflow for incident management, which is likely something that will be important to increase adoption of incidents.\n\nLet's use this issue to pin down what we know, and don't know, by outlining the current incident management functionality, the current woodhouse functionality, and the planned Ecosystem Slack integration updates. Once we've outlined all three of these these things, hopefully the path forward for a tighter Slack-to-GitLab integration for incident management will be clearer. The larger goal for this issue, then, is to define how the Respond team will move forward with improvements to the Slack integration for incidents.\n\n### What have we learned?\n\n1. Current incident management slack functionality --\u003e Outlined in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364422#note_999715591)\n1. Current Woodhouse slack functionality --\u003e Outlined in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364422#note_999837437)\n1. Planned ecosystem slack integration features --\u003e Outlined in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364422#note_999907218)\n\n**Workflow for Slack:**\n\n![Workflow](/uploads/95c3f0682c5752e5d3ac3808f946461f/Workflow.png)\n\nMore information about the workflow in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364422#note_1001299786). \n\n### What should we do next?\n\nBy focusing on the items in green in the workflow diagram above, we can improve the existing Slack workflow for incident response by introducing/shoring up the ability to:\n\n1. Define Slack notification settings for incidents\n1. Declare an incident from Slack, and include options to \n   * Add relevant information to the incident from Slack at the time of incident creation (following Woodhouse).\n   * Add appropriate additional resources to the incident at the time of incident creation (zoom link, create new Slack channel, again following Woodhouse).\n   * Post a notification of incident creation in the appropriate Slack channel, with links to the relevant resources (following Woodhouse).\n   * Post relevant resources that have been added to the incident issue (following Woodhouse).\n1. Keep content synced up between Slack and GitLab\n\nIn practice, that could look like this:\n\n| Create a space to define incident notification settings | Allow people to create an incident from Slack | Allow for adding data to incidents at the time of incident creation | Post a notification linking to relevant resources in Slack when an incident has been created | Add relevant details from Slack directly to the incident | Find a way to send updates to Slack from GitLab | Refine process for adding Slack comments to incidents | Introduce a way to add items to the timeline from Slack |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![Settings_page](/uploads/3645d98c94c32dcfa36235251ff06ad5/Settings_page.png) |![Slack](/uploads/70a321a07d4e393e65f729282d38e231/Slack.png) | ![Slack-4](/uploads/e2388bd3b66ed73e41d389e52d01cc06/Slack-4.png) | ![Slack-1](/uploads/8ef2aec0a6ee7d009da0160ab372449d/Slack-1.png) | ![Incident](/uploads/a512ca3d575918a9feed17e232bb7c49/Incident.png) | ![Incident-1](/uploads/408a9c0209c1256206df5cd5a184522d/Incident-1.png) | ![Slack-2](/uploads/3312ccfd32efd90a889637599f382dc9/Slack-2.png) | ![Slack-3](/uploads/7e56908d9766918f0c757e422df87232/Slack-3.png)  |\n\nOur goal would be to build on the improved GitLab Slack app the Ecosystem is building. However, if the [notifications haven't yet been ported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335673) over to the GitLab Slack app yet, we may need to build on the current GitLab Slack notification integration.
