https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/-/merge_requests/319\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/-/merge_requests/320\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/8324\n\nThe difference is that today, we can take advantage of Workhorse proxying pieces already in place https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/secondary_proxy/index.html which allow Workhorse to proxy the stream to the primary instead of [copying it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/-/merge_requests/320#note_124749927). Though this proposal doesn't resolve the fact that gitlab-shell already holds a copy.","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-01-09T18:50:26.436Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T20:14:29.355Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T20:14:29.338Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["bug::performance","devops::systems","group::geo","section::enablement","type::bug"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387568","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/387568","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/387568/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/387568/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#387568","relative":"#387568","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#387568"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8819,"epic":{"id":607143,"iid":8819,"title":"Geo: Fix timeouts when pushing via SSH to secondary","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8819","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":121472153,"iid":387563,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo Sites - Invalid prop href, Expected String go URL","description":"## What / Why\n\nWe are getting Vue console errors in GDK (suppressed on Production).

- Make search method reusable across registries","description":"## Summary\n\nThis is related to: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364722\n\nAfter allowing Geo to filter registries by keyword, we identified an opportunity to make the `search` method reusable across registries and make the code DRY. \n\nA proposal can be found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/102710#note_1208195076.\n\nAdditionally, there is a good opportunity to move this method to a `finder` class instead: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/reusing_abstractions.html#finders\n\n## Improvements\n\nWe want to extract that common pattern into something more reusable across registries and avoid code duplication.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe want to make sure that filtering by keyword works as expected.\n\n## Involved components\n\nThere is a common pattern between the registries introduced by the following

Requesting this data throws an error and fails the request due to the verification data not existing on non-supported Registries.\n\nThe workaround currently is to define empty verification methods on the Registries to get the GraphQL request to pass.  Additionally the UI will then say `Last verified: Unknown`.\n\nCurrently (2022-01-04) the following Registries that don't support verification and are using this workaround are:\n\n1. [Container Repositories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/geo/container_repository_registry.rb#L13-21)\n2. [Group Wiki Repositories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/geo/group_wiki_repository_registry.rb#L11-21)\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Expose `verification_enabled?` to `ee/geo/replicables/index.html.haml`\n3. Remove \"dummy methods\" from registries that have no verification\n3. Add logic GraphQL request to not fetch verification keys if verification enabled is false\n4.

for commits in the repository commits page fails when trailing spaces exist","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nWhen you paste a commit title, sometimes trailing spaces can be included.\n\nThe query is affected by this invisible character and will return empty.\n\nThis increases in change, because when you copy the heading on the Commit details page, it's easy to include a space. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Go to a commit page of a commit in default branch.\n2. Copy the title of the commit.\n3. Go to the repository commits page of default branch.\n4. Paste the commit title into the search box.\n5. See that no results are returned.\n6. Delete the trailing space.\n7. See the commit being shown.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\ngitlab-org/gitlab, any really.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\nSearch returns empty.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\nSearch returns the desired commit.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n#### Copying the heading in commits page\n![Screenshot_2022-12-21_at_15.05.00](/uploads/eb7ec062c0cc438100bbdd31454faca5/Screenshot_2022-12-21_at_15.05.00.png)\n\n#### Searching for it\n\n![Screenshot_2022-12-21_at_15.05.39](/uploads/08ac0f54956714ba04fcf0f200b9bb65/Screenshot_2022-12-21_at_15.05.39.png)\n\n#### Expected (without trailing space)\n\n![Screenshot_2022-12-21_at_15.06.05](/uploads/098ca0393cd52510e041c5094dd01b1c/Screenshot_2022-12-21_at_15.06.05.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\nSome options:\n\n1. Trim the query string, to avoid trailing and leading spaces?\n\nand/or\n\n2. Add an easy way to copy the title of the commit in the Commits page (copy to clipboard?)\n   1.

[The new endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/99129) `/groups/[group]/-/two_factor_auth` could be improved. If the endpoint is meant to work as a REST API (via AJAX), it shouldn't probably return a redirect (302) to the group members page (/groups/flightjs/-/group_members). It should return a [204](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204) when it successes, or a [400](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400) when it fails. If the endpoint is _not_ meant to work as a REST API then it is fine to redirect, but it could probably take a `POST` instead of a `DELETE` request. Without JavaScript, browsers are typically limited to do `GET` (anchor elements) and `POST` (from form) requests. I have seen delete actions camouflaged in `POST` request (see [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/eduardosanz/disable-2fa/app/assets/javascripts/members/components/modals/remove_member_modal.vue#L105)). In addition, I wonder if the `current_user` and `authenticity_token` couldn't be obviated and deduced form the session cookie sent in the request.\n2. Could we pass the URL path to disable the 2FA to the ~frontend [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106837#note_1207591940)?\n3. Could the ~backend pass to the ~frontend the information if the current user has permission to disable the 2FA of which user? It would consist in adding a `can_disable_two_factor` property for the users to whom the current user is able to disable the 2FA, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106837#note_1207590846).\n\n```\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"members\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": 25,\n        \"created_at\":

queries and frontend according to new Branch Rule structure","description":"Related: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372844#note_1112495519\n\n### Context\n\nAs part of the BranchRulesMVC we are creating additional GraphQL types to expose the branch rule information. The proposed UI designs show that branch rules can optionally have [protected badge](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372844) if the branchRule has a branchProtection record i.e. who can merge and push to the branch(es) matching the `branchProtect.name`. We also have branch rules which match All Branches and All Protected Branches.\n\nThe current implementation cannot achieve this due to the structure of the data. We expose project -\u003e branchRules -\u003e branchProtection, however, in this case the branch rule and branch protection objects are actually the same ProtectedBranch record in the database.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eCurrent structure\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    project ||--|{ branchProtection : has_many\n    project {\n        string id FK \"Global ID of the project\"\n    }\n    branchProtection ||--|{ mergeAccessLevel : has_many\n    branchProtection ||--|{ pushAccessLevel : has_many\n    branchProtection ||--|{ pushAccessLevel : has_many\n    branchProtection ||--|{ unprotectAccessLevel : has_many-EE\n    branchProtection {\n        string name\n        boolean allowForcePush\n        boolean codeOwnerApprovalRequired\n        integer matchingBranchesCount\n        string createdAt\n        string updatedAt\n\n    }\n    mergeAccessLevel {\n        integer accessLevel\n        string accessLevelDescription\n    }\n    pushAccessLevel {\n        integer accessLevel\n        string accessLevelDescription\n    }\n    unprotectAccessLevel {\n        integer accessLevel\n        string accessLevelDescription\n    }\n    branchProtection ||--o{ approvalProjectRule : has_and_belongs_to_many-EE\n    branchProtection ||--o{ externalStatusCheck : has_and_belongs_to_many-EE\n    approvalProjectRule {\n        string id\n        string name\n        string type \"Enum value upcased e.g. REPORT_APPROVER\"\n    }\n    externalStatusCheck {\n        string url\n    }\n```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nCurrently approvalProjectRule and externalStatusCheck can both be orphans too when the user selects \"All branches\" or \"All protected branches\"\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo solve this I'm proposing we introduce a new class called `BranchRule` which would behave as though it were an ActiveRecord model exposing the required details for branch_rule.project, branch_rule.protected_branch, branch_rule.approval_project_rules, and branch_rule.external_status_checks. This change would allow us to display `All branches` and `All Protected Branches` through the API as we could query for them separately to the project.protected_branches and then manually initialize BranchRule objects before resolving the query.\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eProposed structure\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    project ||--|{ branchRule : has_many\n    project {\n        string id FK \"Global ID of the project\"\n    }\n    branchRule ||--o| branchProtection : self\n    branchRule {\n        string name\n        integer matchingBranchesCount\n        string createdAt\n        string updatedAt\n    }\n    branchProtection ||--|{ mergeAccessLevel : has_many\n    branchProtection ||--|{ pushAccessLevel : has_many\n    branchProtection ||--|{ pushAccessLevel : has_many\n    branchProtection ||--|{ unprotectAccessLevel : has_many-EE\n    branchProtection {\n        boolean allowForcePush\n        boolean codeOwnerApprovalRequired\n    }\n    mergeAccessLevel {\n        integer accessLevel\n        string accessLevelDescription\n    }\n    pushAccessLevel {\n        integer accessLevel\n        string accessLevelDescription\n    }\n    unprotectAccessLevel {\n        integer accessLevel\n        string accessLevelDescription\n    }\n    branchRule ||--o{ approvalProjectRule : has_and_belongs_to_many-EE\n    branchRule ||--o{ externalStatusCheck : has_and_belongs_to_many-EE\n    approvalProjectRule {\n        string id\n        string name\n        string type \"Enum value upcased e.g. REPORT_APPROVER\"\n    }\n    externalStatusCheck {\n        string url\n    }\n```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nI think we can implement this system without needing to migrate any data if we use the BranchRule class to present each ProtectedBranch. We can also bring in these records that use `All branches` and `All protected branches` by querying for them separately and then building individual BranchRule objects for the graphql logic to consume.\n\nIn this issue frontend should be updated accordingly","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-09T10:58:53.374Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T04:21:42.439Z","closed_at":"2023-01-11T03:44:50.408Z","closed_by":{"id":11703928,"username":"nradina","name":"Nataliia Radina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11703928/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nradina"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Deliverable","devops::create","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::source code","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::blocked"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":11703928,"username":"nradina","name":"Nataliia Radina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11703928/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nradina"}],"author":{"id":11703928,"username":"nradina","name":"Nataliia Radina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11703928/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nradina"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11703928,"username":"nradina","name":"Nataliia Radina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11703928/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nradina"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385265","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385265","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385265/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385265/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#385265","relative":"#385265","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#385265"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8578,"epic":{"id":583395,"iid":8578,"title":"MVC: Branch Rules Overview","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8578","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":120145904,"iid":385259,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support package registry visibility in the Ruby registry","description":"## :fire: Problem\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329253, we modified the package registry so that it was able to have its own visibility.\n\nThis allowed users to have a private project and a public package registry.\n\nThat change needs to update how the `read_package` permission in each package format API.

Like a button beside the check to re-run the check. We currently use something like that for site validation for DAST profiles. As a first iteration, that would make this a lot more useable when the checks are blocking an MR.\n\n\u003e Yes, we will need backend work. Outside of the 3 actions mentioned [in the doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/status_checks.html), we currently have no way of triggering the webhook that informs the external service to run a check, so we need a new API endpoint for it.\n\n\u003e Here is the [figma link to the designs](https://www.figma.com/file/zqEjEpLS0ggRsbUdzDrWkj/Retry-button-%5BGovern%2FCompliance%23383200%5D?node-id=24%3A7586\u0026t=fyH8him9zvfP4o7n-1)\n\n\u003e Regarding the `Retry` button, we'll need to work with Foundations to make sure we're using the merge report framework correctly. For example, would you expect to see `Retry` on each individual failed check (the `GitBot` example [posted above](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8516#note_1175253079)), or should it only be on the top level (ie 2 failed status checks - Retry all failed checks)\n\n\nThis will require a button to call the retry API from the MR widget\n\nHere is a screenshot with the updated copy on the tooltip: `Retry status check`\n\n![Status_checks_tooltip](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/76e955f73b4f25bd9ba0da14e186b69c/Status_checks_tooltip.png)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n~frontend :two: \n\nPlan to deliver via two MRs - first up:\n\n1. Modify the status check MR widget:(`app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/extensions/status_checks/index.js`) such that failed checks get an additional actions property added, with an `onClick` wired up to a new `retry` method on the component.\n2. `retry` will use the new endpoint developed in !106401+, passing the project id, MR id and statusCheck id. Pass this URL from backend to Vue.\n2. Additionally the `loading` and `disabled` properties of the failed status check `action` will be set.\n3. After triggering retry, we'll remove the status check from `failed` array and move it to `pending`.\n4. Update [GitLab docs on Status Checks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/status_checks.html#block-merges-of-merge-requests-unless-all-status-checks-have-passed).\n\nSecond MR:\n\n5. Updates to the shared MR widget action buttons component: (`app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/widget/action_buttons.vue`) to allow passing through button customisations at mobile to match what can be done at larger sizes, e.g. `loading`, `disabled`, `icon`. Additionally allow setting aria-label on the GLButton.\n6. Modify the action buttons at mobile such that when there is a single, icon-only action, this is rendered directly and not put into a dropdown.\n7.

CHS relies on underlying data being consistent over time so that changes can be easily identified and attributed to the customer doing something differently.\n\nA problem today is that it is difficult to know specifically which metrics are used for CHS and which are not. This results in metrics being updated without knowing beforehand that they are being used for CHS. This then causes a large change in CHS values, even though the customer has not done anything differently.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

Update the `performance_indicator_type` field in the [metrics definition files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/metrics_dictionary.html#metrics-definition-and-validation) to be able to take multiple values.\n1. Introduce a new option to be added to the `performance_indicator_type` field which indicates that the value is used for customer health scoring.\n    * The name of this field should not be specific to a technology (i.e. not `used_by_gainsight`) but should instead reflect that it is used for customer health scoring (some examples may be `used_for_customer_health_scoring`, `health_score_metric`, `customer_health_score_value`, `customer_health_score`, etc)\n1. Update any downstream systems that depend on `performance_indicator_type` to be able to handle multiple values.\n1. Update documentation to describe the field, the new options, why it exists, and the impact of it.\n1. Update documentation to indicate that when this field is set to `true`, any changes or updates to the metric should trigger a ping and review by the Customer Success team.\n\nAs a follow-on to this issue being implemented, this change should be broadly communicated to the product \u0026 engineering teams, customer success teams, and any other groups consuming metrics.\n\nOpen questions:\n1. Can we get a list of existing CHS metrics from Customer Success to pre-populate this field for all relevant metrics?\n    * https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/data/health_score_metrics.csv\n    * As part of this issue, consider updating all existing metric definition files to reflect this and use the new `performance_indicator_type` value. If that is a lot of work, create and schedule a new issue for it.\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Description\n\nWe want to start using the audit event type definition YML files so that these are the single source of truth for audit events. In the next iterations we want to start throwing an exception if an audit event is logged but it doesn't have a corresponding YML definition.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Update the `audit` method of `Gitlab::Audit::Auditor` to add a warning if the name of the event being audited doesn't have an associated YML file. This can be done by creating a method like below:\n\n```ruby\n# Inside lib/gitlab/audit/type/definition.rb\ndef defined?(key)\n  definitions[key.to_sym].present?\nend\n\n# And then use it inside lib/gitlab/audit/auditor.rb\nGitlab::Audit::Type::Definition.defined?('\u003cevent_name\u003e') # add warning logs if false\n```\n2. Update the `initialize` method of `Gitlab::Audit::Auditor` to read from the YML definition (so that the YML is the single source of truth)\n```ruby\n# Inside lib/gitlab/audit/type/definition.rb\ndef stream_only?(key)\n  # if saved_to_database if false then stream_only would be true\n  # since both saved_to_database and stream_only cannot be false together.\n  !definitions[key.to_sym].saved_to_database\nend\n\n# And then use it inside lib/gitlab/audit/auditor.rb\n@stream_only = Gitlab::Audit::Type::Definition.stream_only?(name)\n```\n3. Check the existing YAML definitions and ensure that the `saved_to_database` and `stream` fields matches with the current logic in the codebase and update the existing YAML files in case of mismatch.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-08T13:05:22.971Z","updated_at":"2022-12-19T19:51:41.259Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T05:05:23.913Z","closed_by":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"labels":["backend","devops::govern","group::compliance","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"}],"author":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9821577,"username":"huzaifaiftikhar1","name":"Huzaifa Iftikhar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9821577/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/huzaifaiftikhar1"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385185","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385185","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385185/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385185/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#385185","relative":"#385185","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#385185"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8383,"epic":{"id":566375,"iid":8383,"title":"Audit event type schema definition MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8383","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":120075049,"iid":385179,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `ci_refactoring_external_mapper`","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout the refactoring of the `Gitlab::Ci::Config::External::Mapper` class on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_refactoring_external_mapper` feature flag.\n\n- Introduced in: !106408\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline authoring\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-authoring`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @furkanayhan \n- PM: `@dhershkovitch`\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe the expected outcome when rolling out this feature --\u003e\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\n\u003c!-- What are the settings we need to configure in order to have this feature viable? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- \nExample below:\n \n1.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_refactoring_external_mapper true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com ci_refactoring_external_mapper true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_refactoring_external_mapper true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Set a milestone to the rollout issue to signal for enabling and removing the feature flag when it is stable.\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing estimated time when this feature flag will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_refactoring_external_mapper \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_refactoring_external_mapper \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_refactoring_external_mapper true`\n- [ ] Leave a comment on [the feature issue][main-issue] announcing that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_refactoring_external_mapper --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_refactoring_external_mapper`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_refactoring_external_mapper` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue][main-issue] to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_refactoring_external_mapper --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_refactoring_external_mapper false\n```\n\n\u003c!-- A feature flag can also be used for rolling out a bug fix or a maintenance work.\nIn this scenario, labels must be related to it, for example; ~\"type::feature\", ~\"type::bug\" or ~\"type::maintenance\".\nPlease use /copy_metadata to copy the labels from the issue you're rolling out. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-08T09:51:13.228Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T21:34:48.517Z","closed_at":"2023-01-04T11:20:28.938Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline authoring","maintenance::refactor","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385179","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":6},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385179","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385179/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385179/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#385179","relative":"#385179","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#385179"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":120050673,"iid":385158,"project_id":278964,"title":"Clean up image filter and cluster filter isLoading property and error message","description":"On the vulnerability report, for the image filter and cluster filter, we should do the following:\n\n1.

This job gets enqueued every minute. I see the worker is marked `idempotent!` which is supposed to use deduplication strategy `:until_executing` by default. I think what's happening is each time a Sidekiq worker picks up one of these jobs, then another one gets enqueued, and then runs into this lock.\n\n## Possible solution\n\nMake `VerificationTimeoutWorker` use the job deduplication strategy `:until_executed` so no more jobs get enqueued while one is executing, like:\n\n```ruby\n    deduplicate :until_executed\n    idempotent!\n```\n\n## Possible workaround\n\nCancel the `VerificationTimeoutWorker` locks https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1063043/how-to-release-possible-postgres-row-locks\n\nIt sounds like that should cancel the query as well, which I *assume* should raise an error in the Sidekiq job if it is still running. We want the job to stop running since more will be enqueued anyway.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-06T23:45:25.423Z","updated_at":"2022-12-13T16:38:48.838Z","closed_at":"2022-12-13T00:20:47.162Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["bug::performance","devops::systems","group::geo","priority::4","quick win","section::enablement","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385008","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385008","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385008/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/385008/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#385008","relative":"#385008","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#385008"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119963264,"iid":384973,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove association between ChatName and Integration - Step 2: code changes","description":"This issue is part of the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9418.

See that epic for more details.\n\n## About\n\nWe want to remove the association between a `ChatName` and an `Integration` in order to be able to identify users in Slack without a project or integration.\n\nIn this issue, we can make the association between `ChatName` and `Integration` optional in database modelling. \n\nThe next step in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384973 will be to modify the code to stop associating `ChatName` and `Integration` records, and finally, we will drop the database `chat_names.integration_id` column later in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384974.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Remove the `integration_id` foreign key from `chat_names`. Follow our process for removing a [foreign key constraint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/migration_style_guide.html#removing-a-foreign-key-constraint).\n2. Change some of the indexes on the table:\n    1. Drop the existing UNIQUE index on `(integration_id, team_id, chat_id)`\n    2. Replace the UNIQUE index on `(user_id, integration_id)` index with a non-unique index just on `user_id`. Do this by adding the non-unique index, and then in a second migration drop the other one.\n3. Update the validations in `ChatName`:\n    1. Remove the uniqueness validation on `:user_id` that is scoped to `integration_id`.\n    2. Change the uniqueness validation on `:chat_id` so that it is scoped only to `:team_id`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-06T17:36:14.093Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T10:12:47.384Z","closed_at":"2023-01-02T10:31:53.717Z","closed_by":{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Deliverable","backend","database","devops::manage","group::integrations","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"}],"author":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11722161,"username":"bmarjanovic","name":"Bojan Marjanovic","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11722161/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bmarjanovic"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384963","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384963","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384963/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/384963/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#384963","relative":"#384963","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#384963"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9418,"epic":{"id":673924,"iid":9418,"title":"Identify users in Slack without a project or integration","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9418","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119959681,"iid":384962,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move FreezePeriodsFinder under `CI` module","description":"### Problem\n\nAs [discussed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/105436#note_1196074934) in !105436, the `FreezePeriodsFinder` should be moved under the `CI` module to keep consistency with the [model namespace](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/freeze_period.rb).\n\nThis issue resolves the following discussion from !105436:\n\n- [x] @shinya.maeda started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/105436#note_1196074953):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e ```suggestion:-0+0\n    \u003e         Ci::FreezePeriodsFinder.new(environment.project, context[:current_user]).execute\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Non-blocker.

This can also take an argument for the link type.\n\nExample of new query:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  project(fullPath:\"\u003cproject path\u003e\") {\n    pipeline(iid:\"\u003cpipeline iid\u003e\") {\n      securityReportFinding(uuid:\"\u003cuuid\u003e\") {\n        issueLinks \n          nodes {\n            id\n            issue {\n              \u003cissue data\u003e\n            }\n            linkType\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResponse data will be [`vulnerabilityType.issueLinks`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#vulnerabilityissuelink) and the issue data defined by the [`Issue` type](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#issue)\n\nNote that this differs from the [original discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382913#3-issue-notes \"Spike: Investigate and capture options on how to integrate, deploy and iterate the GraphQL version of the modal\") in the spike. While the spike requests the existing vulnerability feedback data, this will more closely align with the current GraphQL implementation.\n\nThis also require implementing the new vulnerability promotion implementation for issue creation from the REST API. Otherwise we will have a bug where issues get created but not linked through the vulnerabilities.\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- [Spike](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382913#3-issue-notes \"Spike: Investigate and capture options on how to integrate, deploy and iterate the GraphQL version of the modal\")\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\n* [x] Documentation: Update the GraphQL docs\n* [x] Testing: Add appropriate specs including query specs\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nThe original implementation plan was to link issues directly to the security findings while preventing `N+1` queries. While this worked well with the `FindingsFinder`, there were problems when implementing `PipelineVulnerabilitiesFinder`. To prevent further delays and make this work align better with the `vulnerability_feedback` deprecation, @Quintasan helped me rework the Implementation Plan based off of the conversation [noted below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384867#note_1205824481 \"Add issueLinks field to PipelineSecurityReportFinding\"):\n\n* [x] MR 1: Create a Vulnerability from the Security::Finding in `VulnerabilityFeedback::CreateService`\n  * [x] ~backend Use `Vulnerabilities::FindOrCreateFromSecurityFindingService` to create the Vulnerability in `VulnerabilityFeedback::CreateService.create_issue`.\n* [x] Blocker: Make sure Add `vulnerability` in #340558+ is complete.\n  - It is currently being worked on by a wider community member, but may need to be worked by a GitLab team member to expedite the work.\n  - This can be worked in parallel to MR 1\n* [x] MR 2: Use the existing `Vulnerabilities::IssueLink` in the `PipelineSecurityReportFinding`, which has an existing resolver.\n\n## Verification steps\n\nMR 1 (Vulnerability Creation):\n\nNOTE: This can only be verified locally until the whole issue is complete.\n\n1. Create a new local project based off of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports.\n2. Run a pipeline off of a branch.\n3. On `master` branch. Create an issue by clicking the \"Create Issue\" button in the Pipeline Security Findings list.\n4. The issue should be created, but not the Vulnerability.\n5.

events with an auditor account:\n\n- initially records are loaded\n- selecting `last 7 days` sends the URL:\n\n  ```\n  https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/audit_events?created_after=2022-11-29\u0026created_before=2022-12-05\u0026entity_type=Author\u0026author_username=\u003cUSER\u003e\n  ```\n\n  - no records display.\n  - Copying this URL from developer tools and removing `\u0026author_username=\u003cUSER\u003e` results in events showing\n\n\n- changing the data range sends:\n\n  ```\n  https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/audit_events?created_after=2022-11-24\u0026created_before=2022-12-05\u0026entity_type=Author\u0026author_username=\u003cUSER\u003e\n  ```\n\n- sorting sends:\n\n  ```\n  https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/audit_events?created_after=2022-11-24\u0026created_before=2022-12-05\u0026entity_type=Author\u0026sort=created_asc\u0026author_username=\u003cUSER\u003e\n  ```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Log into GitLab.com as an auditor account.\n- Browse to a project group with audit events, eg:  `https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org`\n- Modify view using the last 7 days (etc) buttons, date range, sort etc.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOperating the audit events view with an auditor account results in `\u0026author_username=\u003cUSER\u003e` being added to the URI.

This exacerbates performance problems because Sidekiq will operate at max concurrency and it will be doing unnecessary overhead. For example it may unnecessarily sync the same repo multiple times in a row in quick succession.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\nI don't know how the customer environment got into the state other than they had already been dealing with various performance problems for a long time. You can reproduce this by stopping Sidekiq on a secondary site of a busy GitLab environment for a long time.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nWe noticed this while troubleshooting failed syncs. We manually synced one repo, and then noticed that the `repository_retry_count` had increased by over 100. Therefore, over 100 sync jobs for the exact same repo were run, within a few minutes.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nIdeally, duplicate sync jobs should not be enqueued.\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\nThis was on GitLab 15.0.5 but this probably applies to all existing GitLab versions.\n\n### Workaround\n\nSince Geo tracks sync state in the tracking DB, and will enqueue new sync jobs as needed, then jobs in the `geo:geo_project_sync` queue are not critical data. In the case of a very long queue, we can clear it to reduce pressure on the whole system. (In the case of a normally functioning system, clearing the queue will cause delays in syncing since the system has to realize that syncs are needed and then enqueue new sync jobs).\n\n1.
