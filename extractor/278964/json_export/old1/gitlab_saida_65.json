However, when we retrieve the diff files from external storage, we don't know there is an overflow because we only get back the 3000 files exactly, and we show the size as 3000+ (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/8d5fb3c7cdc8e995e1d003f6f5b61e72ba78677e/app/models/merge_request_diff.rb#L706) but we don't show the warning.\n\nWe should be showing a warning to the user that some files are not shown.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-07T16:36:00.791Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T07:07:04.724Z","closed_at":"2021-06-29T20:24:51.188Z","closed_by":{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","devops::create","diff","group::code review","merge requests","priority::2","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"}],"author":{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5918904,"username":"marc_shaw","name":"Marc Shaw","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78c946cb19e40815a2b5d97cefecec6a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marc_shaw"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332883","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332883","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332883/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332883/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#332883","relative":"#332883","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#332883"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":88338919,"iid":332881,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow + characters in repo names","description":"### Problem to be solved\n\nCustomer has a repository naming conventions that is heavily dependent on using the '+' and they have many existing repositories that have been around for a long time that contain the '+'\n\n### Proposal\nAllow customers to use the '+' in naming repositories","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-07T16:28:27.336Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T20:23:31.936Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T07:09:09.493Z","closed_by":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Category:Source Code Management","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::create","group::authentication and authorization","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

The work would take several milestones. I think we can make the feature more performant and \"future-proof\" by collecting the VSA related data in a different table(s) and keep it up to date asynchronously. \n\n### Feature overview\n\nValue stream analytics measures the duration between two timestamp columns and exposes the matching records. This functionality enables the user to measure the cycle time during the development process.\n\nExample:\n\n- Calculate the average duration between merge request merged at and merge request first deployed to production time.\n- Calculate the average duration between merge request creation and when \"workflow::production\" label was added.\n- Show the relevant records sorted by duration (longest duration first).\n\nSQL (merged at - first deployed to production):\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(merge_request_metrics.first_deployed_to_production_at - merge_request_metrics.merged_at)\nFROM merge_requests\nINNER JOIN (merge_request_metrics...)\nWHERE\nmerge_requests.target_project_id IN (recursive namespace query)\nAND merge_requests.created_at BETWEEN 'X' and 'Y'\n```\n\nNotice the `created_at` filter. This limits the number of rows the DB needs to scan.\n\nThe timestamp column definitions (start event, end event) are stored in a model called `Stage` (table: `analytics_cycle_analytics_group_stages`). A `Stage` is associated with a `Group` or a `Project`. We have a fixed list of supported timestamp columns. Currently, these columns are scattered across the database:\n\n- `merge_requests`\n- `issues`\n- `merge_request_metrics`\n- `issue_metrics`\n- `resource_label_events`\n\nThere are strict rules which timestamp columns are allowed together, a slightly outdated graph can be found here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/value_stream_analytics.html#validating-start-and-end-events\n\n### Performance\n\nThe group-level performance was reviewed in 2019 Q4 and it was approved however since then the feature got significantly slower. Note: we use the standard `IssueableFinders` to build the queries and we look at the whole hierarchy (recursive namespace lookup). My assumption is the number of subgroups, projects, issues and merge requests grew significantly in the past year affect the query performance significantly. \n\n- Median aggregation query from DB-lab: https://explain.depesz.com/s/fj9B, https://explain.depesz.com/s/lvYG\n- Records query: https://explain.depesz.com/s/5AKY\n\nVSA queries `Issue` or `MergeRequest` records within a given time range based on the `created_at` column. We have an index covering the `project_id` and `created_at` columns in both database tables so the number of records we scan is somewhat limited. Note: this is going to change.\n\n### The feature change\n\nThe way VSA works (created_at filter) was defined a long time ago and we don't exactly know the reasoning behind it. There is a [proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330075) to change the `created_at` filter to use the end event timestamp to address the customer confusion concerns.\n\nWe have about 15 possible end events in different database tables which would make the database queries more difficult to optimize (add index or de-normalize and add index). \n\nSupported end events:\n\n```\nissues.created_at\nissue_metrics.first_mentioned_in_commit_at\nissue_metrics.first_associated_with_milestone_at\nissue_metrics.first_added_to_board_atstone_at\nmerge_request_metrics.first_deployed_to_production_at\nmerge_request_metrics.latest_build_started_at\nmerge_request_metrics.latest_build_finished_at\nmerge_request_metrics.latest_closed_at\nmerge_request_metrics.first_commit_at\nmerge_request_metrics.merged_at\nmerge_requests.created_at\nissues.closed_at\nissues.last_edited_at\nresource_label_events.created_at\n```\n\n#### Example 1: Index needed\n\nIn case the end event is `merge_request_metrics.latest_build_finished_at` an extra index is needed on the `target_project_id, latest_build_finished_at` columns. Note that the `target_project_id` is available in the `merge_request_metrics`, this de-normalization was done for an other feature.\n\nWe might also need to tweak the query to avoid joining all the `MergeRequest` records in the group hierarchy and only look at the ones that matching the `merge_request_metrics.latest_build_finished_at` filter.\n\nExample query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(merge_request_metrics.latest_build_finished_at - merge_requests.created_at)\nFROM merge_requests\nINNER JOIN (merge_request_metrics...)\nWHERE\nmerge_requests.target_project_id IN (recursive namespace query)\nAND merge_request_metrics.latest_build_finished_at BETWEEN 'X' and 'Y'\n```\n\n#### Example 2: De-normalization\n\nThe `issue_metrics` database table does not have the `project_id` column, so in case the end event is `issue_metrics.first_added_to_board_at`, then the DB loads all issues within the group hierarchy and join the `issue_metrics` database table. The query will need to scan all `issues` records to filter them down by the joined `issue_metrics` table.\n\nTo make it performant, we can add the `project_id` to the `issue_metrics` table.\n\nNote: the same thing needs to happen in the `resource_label_events` table.\n\n\n#### Database concerns\n\nBy doing these query optimizations for each database columns (about 15 columns) we can make the feature as performant as the current version, however, in my opinion, the costs are quite high:\n\n- De-normalization work for at least 2 tables (minimum 2 milestones).\n- Index creation on `(project_id, timestamp_column)`.\n- Rewriting, optimizing and reviewing the issuable queries for each column.\n- One index is about 3GB, in some cases, we would have fewer rows in the index. \n\nI estimate around 40-50 gigabyte for the indexes only. Note that this number will grow at the same rate as GitLab.com grows. \n\n\n### Alternative solution\n\nValue Stream Analytics is a premium feature so only a small percentage of the `MergeRequest` (\u003c10%) and `Issue` (\u003c3%) records are going to be queried on GitLab.com. By looking at the VSA usage, this number decreases a little bit (`MergeRequest` \u003c5%, `Issue` \u003c3%).\n\nMy idea is to collect and track the start and event timestamps in a separate table so the queries will be mostly `INDEX ONLY SCANs`. To deal with the large data volume, we would run the `AVERAGE` and `MEDIAN` queries with batching (keyset paginated) with some sort of limit to avoid reading too many rows per web request. For example: read maximum 10x10_000 rows (10 queries). If the limit is reached show message: truncated results, too much data.\n\nThe database structure for collecting stage data (for merge requests). Table name: `analytics_merge_request_stage_events`\n\n|column|type|description|\n|-|-|-|\n|merge_request_id|bigint|composite primary key with stage_id|\n|stage_id|bigint|points to the stage record where the start and end event is defined|\n|start_event_timestamp|bigint|stores the start event timestamp for the stage|\n|end_event_timestamp|bigint|stores the end event timestamp for the stage|\n|group_id|bigint|Project's group|\n|project_id|bigint|Project where the merge request was created|\n\nThis structure allows very fast queries where we filter the end event with a time range. Indexes:\n\n```sql\n# in the root group\n(stage_id, end_event_timestamp, start_event_timestamp, merge_request_id)\n# in a subgroup\n(stage_id, group_id, end_event_timestamp, start_event_timestamp, merge_request_id)\n# in a project\n(stage_id, project_id, end_event_timestamp, start_event_timestamp, merge_request_id)\n```\n\nQuery example:\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(end_event_timestamp - start_event_timestamp)\nFROM analytics_merge_request_stage_events\nWHERE end_event_timestamp BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-06-06'\nAND stage_id = 5\n```\n\nThe `merge_request_id` would provide the tie-breaker behaviour when listing records (pagination) and also could be used when aggregating in batches (avoiding statement timeout). For example `count` and `sum` the duration for 10000 records. The query would run N times and we could calculate the average in Ruby:\n\n```ruby\n# N = 2\ncount_batch_1 = 10000\nsum_batch_1 = 123123123\n\ncount_batch_2 = 15\nsum_batch_2 = 123\n\naverage = (sum_batch_1 + sum_batch_2) / (count_batch_1 + count_batch_2)\n```\n\n### Finders and queries\n\nThe current `IssuableFinder` adds extra `JOINs` and `EXISTS` queries to perform the access control (confidential issues, project authorization). Since VSA operates on the `Group` level, we could check group permissions on page load so we can avoid complicated queries.\n\n### Data separation\n\nVSA is an analytical feature that ideally should be in its own database (Timescale?). Today, it's too early to make this move however, with the sharding group work things might be easier in the future. For now, what we can do is prepare for easy separation from the core database tables:\n\n- Eventually consistent data.\n- Asynchronous data collection.\n- No foreign keys on the database columns.\n\nWe'll need a well-defined interface where the data boundaries are crossed (for example when `merge_requests` table is joined). In case our data is in a different database, we could \"easily\" modify the queries to work across database nodes (`disable_joins`).\n\n#### Data collection\n\n`Stage` records are associated with a `Group` or with a `Project`. By collecting all stages in the group hierarchy, we can build batched queries to insert new data in the `analytics_merge_request_stage_events` database table.\n\nThe following table keeps track of the latest processed `updated_at` column value: `analytics_merge_request_stage_updates`\n\n|column|type|description|\n|-|-|-\n|stage_id|bigint|primary key|\n|last_updated_at|timestamp|stores the last processed `merge_requests.updated_at`|\n\nFirst run:\n\n1. Find the top-level `Group` for the stage.\n2. Build a batched (keyset paginated) query over the merge requests in the Group hierarchy. (PoC: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62379)\n3. Collect the timestamps that are required for the stages.\n4. Insert the rows into the `analytics_merge_request_stage_events` table.\n5. Insert a row with `stage_id` and `last_updated_at` values.\n\nSecond run:\n\n1. Find the top-level `Group` for the stage.\n2. Build a batched (keyset paginated) query over the merge requests in the Group hierarchy.\n3. Using the `last_updated_at` column, iterate over the recently updated records.\n4. Insert the rows into the `analytics_merge_request_stage_events` table.\n5. Update the `last_updated_at` column.\n\nNote: we might need to do multiple `LEFT JOINs` to gather the relevant timestamp columns from different tables however, this would not make the query significantly slower. The batch query would always read N `MergeRequest` rows.\n\nNot sure this is the best idea. Currently, I don't have a \"cheaper\" way of detecting `Issue` or `MergeRequest changes in a group hierarchy. I don't think we have hosted plan specific pub-sub functionality.\n\n#### Consistency\n\nWhen a `MergeRequest` or an `Issue` record is updated, the record update process described above would \"catch\" the changes and the data would be updated eventually. \n\nWe also need to ensure consistency when the project is removed or some records were deleted. We can do that with a periodic job that scans through the `analytics_merge_request_stage_events` database table and makes an `EXISTS` query against the `merge_requests` table.\n\n#### Table size\n\nSince we might have multiple stages per group, we would store quite a lot's of data in the `analytics_merge_request_stage_events` database table (worst case: 5 rows per merge request record). To address table size concerns, we could do hash partitioning or time range partitioning (use time-decay pattern if Product is OK with keeping 1 or 2 years of data).\n\n#### Cross joins\n\nVSA allows filtering on labels, author, assignee, milestone. With the new structure, we would be able to query this data using `JOINs`. When we have complete separation (different data store), this data would need to be duplicated.\n\n#### No FOSS\n\nThere is a free (FOSS) version of VSA with fixed stages, no customization allowed, project-level only. Collecting data for FOSS users would cost too much storage and processing power. In order to keep the data volume low, we cannot support the FOSS version. We can keep the old behavior (no timestamp filter change).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-07T12:21:03.646Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:09:29.883Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T15:09:29.851Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","backend","bug::performance","devops::manage","group::optimize","section::dev","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332851","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332851","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332851/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332851/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#332851","relative":"#332851","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#332851"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6046,"epic":{"id":274497,"iid":6046,"title":"[VSA] Date range filter should apply to end events","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6046","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":88318703,"iid":332846,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move user administration to a dropdown button to match the behavior of member's listing.","description":"## Issue\nSee originating issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327378\n\nThe Members Admin screen is unnecessarily messy.

widget","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nIf your pipeline contains Dependency Scanning artifacts from both the base gemnasium dependency scanning job as well as the gemnasium-python dependency scanning job, the Security scanning widget in the merge request will display `Dependency scanning: Loading resulted in an error`. \n\nUsing the browsers network debugger, we can see requests to the `dependency_scanning_reports.json` file for the MR (e.g. `https://gitlab.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/1/dependency_scanning_reports`) is returning a 400, with a status_reason of `JSON parsing failed`.\n\nThe results of these scans still appear without issue in the full report, and on the Security tab of the pipeline itself. The reports themselves are valid as well.\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n- MR that fails: https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo/ds-mr-bug/-/merge_requests/1\n- Corresponding pipeline view that sucessfully parses the reports: https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo/ds-mr-bug/-/pipelines/315248866/security\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nThe Dependency Scanning section of the Security scanning MR widget displays `Dependency scanning: Loading resulted in an error`. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nThe widget properly displays the scanners findings of both valid reports. \n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe problem happens [when merging artifacts into one report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/d25802063e9bb06fd03c771f99bc7fcd53bdae5d/ee/app/services/security/merge_reports_service.rb#L67) (and it's called [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d25802063e9bb06fd03c771f99bc7fcd53bdae5d/ee/app/models/ee/ci/build.rb#L176)). Findings are compared by [scanner keys](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d25802063e9bb06fd03c771f99bc7fcd53bdae5d/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/security/scanner.rb#L47) and in the case of this issue, this comparison fails as one of the reports (python one) returns `nil` instead of an array of keys.\n\nFor undiscovered reasons when scanners are compared, in some cases `vendor` is returned as `nil`. As we're going to remove scanner category from vulnerabilities, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233359, it makes sense to make a small fix for now.\n\nFailing examples:\n\n```\n\u003e a = [3, \"gemnasium\", \"Gemnasium\", nil]\n\u003e b = [3, \"gemnasium\", \"Gemnasium\", \"GitLab\"]\n\u003e a \u003c=\u003e b\n=\u003e nil\n```\n\nComparing with `compact` fixes this issue.\n\n### Proposed fix\n\nUpdate [scanner comparer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/856a51d3b0444bd6fa138b66dd59acc8e40527bd/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/security/scanner.rb#L42-L42) to compare compact arrays of

Visit dependency list page for a project: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven/-/dependencies\n1. Expand some of the vulnerabilities and look at the severity values. Notice that they're sorted in decreasing order of severity value, with the highest/most important vulnerabilities listed first. This is what I would consider a _descending_ sort order, for example: highest to lowest, largest to smallest, most important to least important, yet the sort order icon is _ascending_ and the sort order that's sent to the [backend endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven/-/dependencies.json?sort_by=severity\u0026sort=asc\u0026page=1\u0026filter=all) is is also _ascending_ (`asc`):\n\n   `dependencies.json?sort_by=severity\u0026sort=asc`\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-maven/-/dependencies\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDependency list shows `ascending` icon for sorting dependencies by severity level, meanwhile the dependencies are sorted in the `descending` order.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe icon for sorting the dependency list should match the current sort order.\n\n### Related discussions\n\nSee [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62983#note_592130914) for further details\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1. Change [fetchDependencies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/35644c23da3/ee/app/assets/javascripts/dependencies/store/modules/list/actions.js#L27-57) to use a `desc` sort order by default when fetching the vulnerabilities from the `dependencies.json` endpoint\n1. Update [Security::DependencyListService#sort()](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/35644c23da3/ee/app/services/security/dependency_list_service.rb#L53-67) and the other sorting methods in the file to ensure that `asc` order is `info, unknown, low, medium, high, critical` and `desc` order is `critical, high, medium, low, unknown, info`\n1. Update the spec for [Security::DependencyListService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/d830b385471/ee/spec/services/security/dependency_list_service_spec.rb#L1-1) to make sure that all tests pass and use the correct sorting order and label. \n\n   For example, the test [`sorted by desc severity`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/d830b385471/ee/spec/services/security/dependency_list_service_spec.rb#L94-109) will need to be changed\n\n   from:\n\n   ```ruby\n   context 'sorted by desc severity' do\n     let(:params) do\n       {\n         sort: 'desc',\n         sort_by: 'severity'\n       }\n     end\n   \n     it 'returns array of data properly sorted' do\n         ...\n     end\n   end\n   ```\n\n   to:\n   \n   ```ruby\n   context 'sorted by asc severity' do\n     let(:params) do\n       {\n         sort: 'asc',\n         sort_by: 'severity'\n       }\n     end\n   \n     it 'returns array of data properly sorted' do\n         ...\n     end\n   end\n   ```\n\n\n/cc @gonzoyumo @NicoleSchwartz @mkaeppler","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-04T04:01:45.813Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T07:09:20.393Z","closed_at":"2021-07-07T09:27:07.411Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","dependency list","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::2","section::sec","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332653","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332653","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332653/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332653/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#332653","relative":"#332653","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#332653"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":88192096,"iid":332652,"project_id":278964,"title":"Support `finished_after` filter in Deployment API","description":"## Release notes\n\nWith this update, you can now filter the list of deployments in a project by `finished_before` or `finished_after`. Previously, filtering was allowed only by the updated dates. This allows you to more efficiently search for the relevant deployments in your workflow.\n\n## Problem\n\nDeployment API has `updated_before` filter, which was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33101. The issue describes that:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nAn Enterprise customer is pulling data from the [\"list project deployments\" API endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deployments.html#list-project-deployments) to populate a custom-built dashboard. The customer only wants to display the latest changes. However, the customer has no way to restrict the API results to the latest changes. Instead, the customer retrieves all records, checks one-by-one and processes only the records updated after the latest `updated_at` value in the last batch retrieved. The customer has asked for the ability to query for `updated_at` values after a specified timestamp.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n`updated_at` filtering would make sense in Issues or MRs context, however, it does _NOT_ make sense in deployments context. For example, looking at a query that customers are currently executing:\n\n```\nSELECT\n    \"deployments\".*\nFROM\n    \"deployments\"\n    INNER JOIN \"environments\" ON \"environments\".\"id\" = \"deployments\".\"environment_id\"\nWHERE\n    \"deployments\".\"project_id\" = $ 1\n    AND \"deployments\".\"updated_at\" \u003c= $ 2\n    AND \"environments\".\"name\" = $ 3\nORDER BY\n    \"deployments\".\"iid\" DESC\nLIMIT\n    $ 4 OFFSET $ 5\n```\n\nThis **does NOT** fetch the latest changes to the environment that the original issue was born for. But this fetches mixed states of deployment _records_ that includes:\n\n- Deployments that actually deployed to the target environment. This is the \"changes\" in deployment context.\n- Deployment jobs that still running to the target environment. (It should be excluded)\n- Failed deployment jobs that didn't make into the target environment. (It should be excluded)\n- Canceled deployment jobs that didn't make into the target environment. (It should be excluded)\n- These mixed-states deployment rows are ordered by `iid`, which is **creation order, not update order** (See more https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29884#note_549584527) (i.e. this sorting is messing up `updated_at` filtering)\n\nWe should allow them to filter by `finished_at` instead. Here is the correct query/parameter combination to fetch latest changes/deployments to a specific environment.\n\n```\nSELECT\n    \"deployments\".*\nFROM\n    \"deployments\"\nWHERE\n    \"deployments\".\"environment_id\" = 1069567\n    AND \"deployments\".\"status\" = 2\n    AND \"deployments\".\"finished_at\" \u003c= '2021-04-14T09:05:29Z'\nORDER BY\n    \"deployments\".\"finished_at\" DESC\nLIMIT\n    100 OFFSET 100\n```\n\nFYI, this query can be executed in 40ms, which is 2000x faster than the query above.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAllow `finished_before` and `finished_after` query parameters to be passed to [Deployment LIST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deployments.html#list-project-deployments)\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/lib/api/deployments.rb

Users can re-edit their comments on Merge Requests which they no longer have access to","description":"**[HackerOne report #1212288](https://hackerone.com/reports/1212288)** by `cradlr` on 2021-05-28, assigned to GitLab Team:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nA guest user can re-edit their comments in the Merge Request comment section when they no-longer have access to that Merge Request as a guest user.\n\n**We can fix this issue following the normal flow instead of the security flow**, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332646#note_592596619.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. I have used Firefox containers to gave multiple sessions in 1 browser. Create 2 user accounts in gitlab.com.  \n2. From the main owner's account create a project -\u003e create a Group. Invite a member to that Group with the privileges of owner.  \n3. Create a project form the main owner's account under the group which has shared owner privileges.  \n4. Switch to the invited user's session and Create an issue-\u003eCreate a Merge Request.-\u003eThen add the file.  \n5. Now comment on the Merge Request from the main owner's account and put a reply to that comment form the invited user's account.  \n6. Re-edit the response made by the invited user and push that request to repeater.  \n7. Change the permissions of the invited user's account to guest and assign that particular merge request to the main owner from the main owner's account.  \n8. Refresh the session of the invited user's account. 404 error message shows up.  \n9. Switch to repeater and edit the response and fire the request. We get a 500 Server error message.  \n10. Verify the changes from the main owner's account.\n\n```\n====================PUT REQUEST===========================  \nPUT /test-groups2/owner-subgroup/inherited/notes/588153581 HTTP/1.1  \nHost: gitlab.com  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;

I'll (@kassio) focus on fix that next, which might be the reason of the missing diff note comments.\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332630#note_600582875\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nPer [this note](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332630#note_637900725):\n\n* [ ] Implement fetching issue comments and MR comments 1 at a time, instead of page by page.\n* [ ] Put this change behind a feature flag that is disabled by default.\n* [ ] Document this solution with the recommended number of issues/MR above which one should consider using this method.\n\n## Out of scope\n\nFollowing features/ideas were discussed, but are not included in this issue:\n* Rewriting GitHub Importer to use GraphQL. - not all the needed resources are available in GitHub's GraphQL\n* A hybrid solution that utilizes both approaches (paging and fetching 1 at a time), as needed. - too complex\n* A solution that analyzes the data and recommends an approach. - a potential future enhancement","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-03T19:57:40.420Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T09:32:27.421Z","closed_at":"2021-08-24T10:29:50.472Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Importer:GitHub","Next Up","Unplanned","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::import","milestone::p1","missed:14.0","missed:14.1","section::dev","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":77,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332630","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332630","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332630/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/332630/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#332630","relative":"#332630","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#332630"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6270,"epic":{"id":299300,"iid":6270,"title":"⚙️ GitHub Importer Reliability Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6270","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 31, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":88179394,"iid":332626,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make it apparent when subgroup can't invite groups outside the root group namespace","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n### Problem\n\nWhen a subgroup is unable to invite groups outside of its root group namespace, it might not be apparent to a subgroup owner who is searching for groups to invite and can't find them.

with very expensive updates or a combination of both) so that the job can not finish on time with the set batch size, we have no way to retry the job while breaking it in smaller jobs.\nI think that there are 2 paths to consider here:\n\nAbility to run a failed job with an increased ExclusiveLease timeout (easy solution but we will always hit a threshold)\nAbility to split a job to two (or

duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThere are public projects that intentionally restrict visibility of the source code to _only_ project members. (for example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com)\n\nProject members can fork these projects into another namespace to test changes without impacting the upstream project.\n\nA project member clicking \"Fork\" will copy the project, but not the project visibility settings. This can lead to unintentionally exposing proprietary source code never intended for public consumption.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create public project in a group namespace.\n2. Set repository view/edit access to \"Only Project Members\" \n![image](/uploads/37ef9cd5e081298b5bf6472fecb9ee23/image.png)\n3. Verify that project source code is not publicly visible using different browser or incognito mode\n4. Fork this project into your personal namespace.\n5. Verify that the project source code on the fork is publicly visible.\n\nResults of not realizing this happened: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/sirt/operations/-/issues/1454\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com (any GitLab team member forking this project will publicly expose the source code)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAs a project member, forking a project with Repository visibility set to \"Only Project Members\" creates a project where Repository is visible to all.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nProject members forking a project with Repository visibility set to \"Only Project Members\" have their fork's Repository visibility also configured to \"Only Project Members\" (perhaps with them as the only member?)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug

They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4315, we introduced a `User Cap` setting for self-managed admins to prevent accidental user overages, now we are doing the same for SaaS group owners to prevent accidental overages.\n\nThis work will be broken down into the following backend steps:\n\n- [Add user cap setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332590) \n- [Adding/inviting members](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332592)\n- [Notifications](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332595)\n- [Member management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332596)\n- [Auto approval](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334381)\n- [Approval Modal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334822)\n- [Group access modifications](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332598)\n- **Group sharing** :point_left: we are here\n- [UserCap availability](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342227)\n\nFor a given group, group sharing should be disabled when:\n* this group's ancestor group has a User cap set.\n* this group is an ancestor group and has a User cap set.\n\nIf a User Cap setting is enabled for a root group, then `Namespace#share_with_group_lock` should be enabled for this root group as well as all its subgroups.\n\nThis discussion around this requirement will add more context: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5803#note_558309774.\n\nThe \"disable group share\" functionality is being delivered as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217623\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- Epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5803\n- Designs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321934/designs/V4.png, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328680/designs/pending.png\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Add validation for User Cap enablement to require (or auto enable?) disabling of group sharing\n\n## Additional notes\n\nFurther consideration for this change is:\n\nWhat should happen with the associated group sharing disable attribute when an owner disables the User Cap feature?\n\nInitial thoughts are that the attribute can be enabled independantly from User Caps, so it should be left enabled because we have no way of knowing if it was enabled in conjunction with User Caps or not, but this should be confirmed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-03T14:36:54.369Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T04:39:55.658Z","closed_at":"2021-08-10T10:58:46.922Z","closed_by":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne

Use a `.gitlab-ci.yml` with a start and stop job, [example here](https://gitlab.com/cat/repro-auto-stop/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml)\n1. Deploy the environment, wait for it to get auto stopped\n1. Deploy the environment again, and notice after \"auto_stop_in\" time passes (minimum hourly because it's in a Sidekiq cron job, see #240886) the environment shows as stopped, but the stop job never ran again.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/cat/repro-auto-stop/-/pipelines/313613453\n\nYou can see both jobs ran, but if you look at https://gitlab.com/cat/repro-auto-stop/-/jobs, the stop job only ran `once`, for the first auto-stop, and the environments shows as stopped [on the Environments page](https://gitlab.com/cat/repro-auto-stop/-/environments).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nEnvironments don't get properly stopped when using auto_stop_in, if they get redeployed\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`auto_stop_in` should be respected and environments get properly auto stopped.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nThe problem is really that `Ci::StopEnvironmentsService#execute_in_batch` attempts to preload the stop_actions for every environment. There is a [condition in the CTE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/bf490f3d50512d2e6e741535736c2a2d5ed40605/app/models/environment.rb#L191) that only retrieves jobs with the status as `BLOCKED_STATUS` (manual, scheduled). However, we [update all the environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/bf490f3d50512d2e6e741535736c2a2d5ed40605/app/services/ci/stop_environments_service.rb#L26) to `state: stopped` either way, but the stop_actions aren't actually fetched and ran.\n\nManually finding the stop_action job and running it works, so it doesn't seem like a limitation when the job has the status `success`, through something like: `Environment.find(id).stop_with_action!(User.find_by_username(\"root\"))`\n\nCurrently, the only workaround seems to be manually _finding_ (since the environment is now stopped, so this is no easy way by itself) \u0026 running the stop job again.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-02T14:48:35.936Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T15:38:56.487Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T15:38:56.453Z","closed_by":{"id":9396342,"username":"acook.gitlab","name":"Allen
