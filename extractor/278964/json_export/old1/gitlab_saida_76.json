In both cases, the scans are failing with a `Testing failed: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow` exception, which kills the job before it test all endpoints.  This appears to be caused by GET endpoints that accept `number` value types.  When these endpoints are removed from the service, the fuzz job runs successfully.  I tried playing with the format of the `number` type, changing it to `double`, `float`, or leaving it blank, but the job failed with all combinations.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a REST service using Swagger to implement the OpenAPI spec.

This is a long standing issue. e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321788\n- We're lacking of cache mechanizm to reduce the number of authorization processes. Currently, we execute database queries in every single authorization.\n- We don't have SSOT facility to maintain the authorization logic thus it's hard to be extended for group-level feature.\n- This issue is also affected by [Direct relationship between Pipeline Job and Environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326445).\n\nThe N+1 problems are currently mitigated by a temporary caching, however, since it's tightly related to project context, we can't easily extend it to group-level.\n\nWe tried to find a way to build the group-level feature without addressing these issues, however, it'd be quite challenging to pass the performance reviews with the current shape. Especially, group-level feature requires more complex-and-expensive database query execution, meaning there is a risk to be an SLA issue and required to rework in the future.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWith keeping in mind that [Group-level protected environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888) feature implementation comes at next iteration, we should improve the following things:\n\n- Introduce SSOT facility for the authorization to make the auth logic container agnostic.\n- Refactor the project-specific caching for the SSOT facility.\n- Introduce a new caching logic as described below.\n\nGiven that there are N jobs, the following process happens per authorization.\n\n- Can the user executes the job?\n- Will the job interact with environment?\n- Does the user have an access to the environment?\n- Fetch protected environments row. (Cached with RequestStore)\n- Fetch deploy access levels. (Cached with RequestStore)\n- Evaluate (sometimes executes a query to `namespaces` or `check_access`)\n\nThe point is that we should cache \"Does the user have an access to the environment?\" result\nin `RequestStore`. This works for both project and group levels.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-30T13:00:26.876Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T07:11:20.160Z","closed_at":"2021-05-21T07:11:20.146Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Release Orchestration","Release::P2","bug::performance","cicd::active","devops::release","group::release","missed:13.11","section::ops","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233762,"iid":58,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.12","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.948Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:18.898Z","due_date":"2021-05-17","start_date":"2021-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/58"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326329","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326329","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326329/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326329/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#326329","relative":"#326329","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#326329"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":81924136,"iid":326319,"project_id":278964,"title":"Introduce a new configuration key for artifacts to validate the security report schemas","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nAs we will start validating the security report artifacts, we want to implement a way to transition towards that goal without breaking the existing security jobs.

Instead, the only `export_status` returned when using this method is `none` which can be counterintuitive and limiting if programmatically exporting multiple projects using a script. This also differs from regular API exports.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create an S3 bucket and generate a pre-signed URL. In my case, I used [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html) and a python script to generate it. The results look something like this:\n\n```bash\n❯ python3 export_script_b.py --bucket-name cbledsoe-test-bucket --object-name download\ncurl -i --request PUT --upload-file download 'https://cbledsoe-test-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/download?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=XXXus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20210329T214809Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=XXX'\n```\n\n2. Do a curl POST export as outlined by our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_import_export.html#schedule-an-export) using the previously generated pre-signed URL\n\n```bash\n❯ curl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cMY_PAT\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24702853/export\" \\\n    --data \"upload[http_method]=PUT\" \\\n    --data-urlencode \"upload[url]=https://cbledsoe-test-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/download?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=XXXus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20210329T214809Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=XXX\"\n{\"message\":\"202 Accepted\"}%\n```\n\nIn this case, there was a 202 accepted and the file was uploaded as expected a few seconds later:\n\n![download](/uploads/9418ab21602d6a2b2d1e1be5ffa91a44/download.png)\n\n3. Immediately check the status of the export:\n\n```bash\n❯ curl -s --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cREDACTED\u003e\" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24702853/export | jq\n\n{\n  \"id\": 24702853,\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"name\": \"cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"name_with_namespace\": \"GitLab.com - Gold / cbledsoe-test / cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"path\": \"cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"path_with_namespace\": \"gitlab-gold/cbledsoe-test/cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2021-02-25T21:04:46.477Z\",\n  \"export_status\": \"none\"\n}\n```\nNote how the `export_status` is `none`.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen exporting to an S3 bucket via our API, the `export_status` returns `none` immediately after export.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen exporting to an S3 bucket via our API, the `export_status` should return `Finished` immediately after export.\n\n### Additional Thoughts\n\nNote that this behavior _does_ differ on how it works when doing regular exports:\n\n```bash\n❯ curl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cREDACTED\u003e\" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24702853/export\n{\"message\":\"202 Accepted\"}%\n❯  curl -s --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cREDACTED\u003e\" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24702853/export | jq\n{\n  \"id\": 24702853,\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"name\": \"cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"name_with_namespace\": \"GitLab.com - Gold / cbledsoe-test / cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"path\": \"cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"path_with_namespace\": \"gitlab-gold/cbledsoe-test/cbledsoe-small-project\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2021-02-25T21:04:46.477Z\",\n  \"export_status\": \"finished\",\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"api_url\": \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/24702853/export/download\",\n    \"web_url\": \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/cbledsoe-test/cbledsoe-small-project/download_export\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis happens on GitLab.com 13.11.0-pre a3f68244027\n\n### ZD Tickets\n\n- https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/201296\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThe [method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/project.rb#L1948-1960) that returns export status returns `none` as the last resort.\n\nThe web [upload strategy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/after_export_strategies/base_after_export_strategy.rb#L90-94) deletes the export file after it's done uploading the file to the destination. Since the export file no longer exists, the export status is set to `none`.\n\nTo fix this, we should just leave (not remove) the export file, which would follow the same logic we have for the other export.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-29T22:24:43.025Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T21:58:53.766Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T08:20:11.314Z","closed_by":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Importer:Project Export/Import","Next Up","customer","devops::manage","estimation::completed","group::import","milestone::p2","section::dev","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"}],"author":{"id":5537005,"username":"cleveland","name":"Cleveland Bledsoe Jr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b3b602b16b5453efe7c1190e8ae558e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cleveland"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":674121,"username":"georgekoltsov","name":"George Koltsov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/674121/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/georgekoltsov"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326269","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326269","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326269/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/326269/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#326269","relative":"#326269","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#326269"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3054,"epic":{"id":39522,"iid":3054,"title":"🐞 Project Export/Import bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3054","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":81869898,"iid":326249,"project_id":278964,"title":"Move ManageViaMr component to CE","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/57496 we have built a `ManageViaMr` component that triggers a mutation to create a configuration MR for the given security feature.

These migrations are run when a sidekiq-cron entries executes the `Database::BatchedBackgroundMigrationWorker`. With the feature flag disabled, the worker execution is a no-op.\n\n- #288004 \n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Database\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_database`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @gitlab-org/database\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how the feature should be rolled out, and check the right boxes. You can check multiple if applicable --\u003e\n\n- [ ] Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with beta groups\n- [x] Rollout on GitLab.com, until the migration completes or is proven not to have negative performance impact\n- [ ] Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com - XX%\n    If it is possible to perform an incremental rollout, this should be preferred. Proposed increments are: `10%`, `50%`, `100%`. Proposed minimum time between increments is 15 minutes.\n- [ ] Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect the background migrations to begin processing each batch of work sequentially. We chose initial conservative batch sizes that should not have a negative impact on database stability or performance.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf the batching proves to cause more load than expected, database stability could suffer. If this happens, the feature flag can be turned off to disable the migration processing framework from executing any future jobs.\n\nThe job information is tracked in the database, so there should be no negative impact if job processing needs to be temporarily or permanently halted. We can always reschedule the migration to pickup from the previous location.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/000000167/postgresql-tuple-statistics?orgId=1\u0026refresh=1m\n\nHigh rate of updates for `events` or `push_event_payload` tables, or increasing percentage of dead tuples for those tables, which could indicate autovacuum cannot keep up.\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/000000144/postgresql-overview?orgId=1\n\nHigh system usage or tps on the primary database server.\n\n## Rollout Timeline\n\n\u003c!-- Please check which steps are needed and remove those which don't apply --\u003e\n\n**Initial Rollout**\n\n*Preperation Phase*\n- [x] Enable on staging (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true --staging`)\n\n- [x] Test on staging\n\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default))\n\n- [ ] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` by pinging `@sre-oncall`\n  - In `#g_delivery` by pinging `@release-managers`\n\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n\n**Global Availability** ([More Info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change))\n*(Please Note that Beta,Alpha and General Availability (GA) are handled on a product level and not the feature-flag)*\n\u003c!-- The next checkboxes are probably only needed for high visibility and/or critical rollouts.

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \nWhen applying a single MR suggestion, you can [write a custom commit message](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#suggest-changes).  But when applying a [batch of MR suggestions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#batch-suggestions), the custom commit message dialog is not presented.\n\nI noticed @jerasmus started work on this on !49102 a few months ago, but that MR was closed.  I couldn't find an open issue tracking that feature, so I'm opening this one to make sure it doesn't get lost.\n\nRelated: #25486 and #25381\n\n### Intended users\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### User experience goal\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey --\u003e\n\n### Further details\nThis matters for my team's workflow since we have a [custom update hook](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/templates/hooks--update.sample) that requires commit messages to have a certain format.  (The [project-wide merge suggestion commit message template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#configure-the-commit-message-for-applied-suggestions) isn't adequate for this, since our custom update hook requires the corresponding issue number, which isn't one of the available variables for that template.)\n\n### Permissions and Security\n* Same permissions as for [writing a custom commit message for a single suggestion](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#suggest-changes)\n\n### Documentation\n* Mention in a new subsection of https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#suggest-changes\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?

Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\n### Available Tier\n\n\u003c!-- This section should be used for setting the appropriate tier that this feature will belong to. Pricing can be found here: https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/\n\n* Free\n* Premium/Silver\n* Ultimate/Gold\n--\u003e\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!--\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.\n\nCreate tracking issue using the the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n--\u003e\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n\u003c!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature?

Proposed increments are: `10%`, `50%`, `100%`. Proposed minimum time between increments is 15 minutes.\n- [ ] Coordinate a time to enable the flag with the SRE oncall and release managers\n  - In `#production` mention `@sre-oncall` and `@release-managers`. Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [ ] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. **Note**: Once a feature rollout has started, it is not necessary to inform `@sre-oncall`/`@release-managers` at each stage of the gradual rollout.\n- [ ] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set feature_name true`)\n- [ ] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [ ] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry. Ensure that the feature flag definition YAML file has been removed in the **same MR** that is removing the feature flag from the code\n- [ ] After the flag removal is deployed, [clean up the feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) by running chatops command in `#production` channel\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab feature_name false\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nPlease make sure `package-and-qa` job is passing before enabling the feature flag by default. Multiple E2E tests that use sidebar will need to be updated.

They must now ensure that they add a `stages` keyword into their yaml AND add a `dast` stage.\n\n### Solution\n\n- [ ] Update our documentation to specify that `dast` stage must be added to a customers `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. We already reference the `stages` keyword in the documentation but are not explicit that customers need to define it. Customers did not previously need to define it if they relied on the 5 default gitlab stages `.pre`, `build`, `test`, `deploy`, `post`.\n- [x] Put out a blog post of this breaking change, since in 14.0 we plan to move the contents of `DAST.latest.gitab-ci.yml` to `DAST.gitlab-ci.yml`\n- [ ] Add a comment to the DAST template:

Create a Group with at least 2 Projects\n1. Create a new Iteration for the Group\n1. Add at least one Issue to the Iteration from each of at least 2 Projects\n1. Navigate to one of the Projects, then open the Iteration Report for the Iteration created above\n1. View the Burndown Chart and Burnup Chart issues relative to the Issue Counts at the top and Issue List at the bottom, note the inconsistency\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/iteration-burndown-test/project1/-/iterations/17637\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe behavior we observe is that the Project-level view correctly lists the issues (and issue count) just associated with that Project, however the Burndown and Burnup charts seem to include issue counts / issue weights for the entire Group (and thus don't match the rest of the report).\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe expected that the Group-level Iteration Report would show the full burndown of all issues tagged in the Iteration, while the Project-level Iteration Report would show the burndown for just the issues in that Project tagged in the Iteration.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or

Try to send trace in a predefined intervals configurable by `X-GitLab-Trace-Update-Interval`\n1. If no trace is generated for longer period a additional request is generated `/api/:version/jobs/:id` with `status: running` to PING GitLab\n1. We can configure trace sending interval via `X-GitLab-Trace-Update-Interval`\n1. We lack ability to configure `TraceForceSendInterval`\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Add `X-GitLab-Trace-Ping-Interval` to Rails that is a value higher than `X-GitLab-Trace-Update-Interval`\n1. Likely a default should be 5 mins (it is enough)\nthat would configure `TraceForceSendInterval`\n1. Extend Runner to parse header in a similar way as `X-GitLab-Trace-Update-Interval` and apply this as `TraceForceSendInterval`\n1. Update the `common.MaxUpdateInterval` to be higher than `3 * time.Minute`, likely to be `15 * time.Minute` (for future proofing)\n1. Define the `common.MaxTraceForceSendInterval` to be a value of at least `30 * time.Minute` (for future proofing)\n\n## Changes\n\n1. Extend Rails to send a new header in a similar way to `X-GitLab-Trace-Ping-Interval`\n1. Extend Runner to receive `X-GitLab-Trace-Ping-Interval` and apply for `TraceForceSendInterval` in a similar way as for `UpdateInterval`\n\n## Related\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324371#note_536524306: discussion on how this is implemented today\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56743: MR reducing frequency of updates\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324372#note_535047226: investigation on frequency of PING\n\n## Outcome\n\nWe expect a significant reduction of requests that perform PING (`status: running`) as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/324372#note_535047226. Based on interval, we might be looking at:\n\n- from: running: **65%** (39,117,530 hits, filter used: `json.meta.caller_id.keyword: \"/api/:version/jobs/:id\" and json.params.key.keyword: \"state\" and json.params.value.keyword: \"running\"`)\n- to: running: 3,911,7530 (reducing amount of requests for this state by 90% for 7 day interval) for a value of that is for 5 minutes if all runners would be updated\n- effective: I would assume that we would reduce this number by around 50%, since not all runners would be updated. However, since we control majority of builds processed this will have a significant effect very early when this change is made.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-25T12:33:26.978Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T20:44:15.381Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T14:46:37.266Z","closed_by":{"id":5878538,"username":"ajwalker","name":"Arran Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/13209547f9f01b0bbb1d3b340263573c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ajwalker"},"labels":["Eng-Consumer::Infrastructure","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","FY22::Q3","SaaS","Verify::P1","[Deprecated] Category:Runner","auto updated","backend","database","devops::verify","group::runner","infradev","priority::4","reliability","section::ops","severity::4","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":5878538,"username":"ajwalker","name":"Arran Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/13209547f9f01b0bbb1d3b340263573c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ajwalker"}],"author":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5878538,"username":"ajwalker","name":"Arran Walker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/13209547f9f01b0bbb1d3b340263573c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ajwalker"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325970","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/325970","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/325970/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/325970/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#325970","relative":"#325970","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#325970"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5593,"epic":{"id":225032,"iid":5593,"title":"Shift DB load from Primary to Replicas Rapid Action Descoped Candidates","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5593","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":81630057,"iid":325960,"project_id":278964,"title":"Do not display \"Root image\" when loading container repository details","description":"### :fire: Bug\n\nWhen loading a heavy container repository (with several 10K+ of tags) details page, the loading takes a non trivial amount of time.\n\nDuring that time, we see this:\n\n![Screenshot_2021-03-25_at_12.18.22](/uploads/30cd7f226bab91b1aa0efc6f8dd3267f/Screenshot_2021-03-25_at_12.18.22.png)\n\nIt is confusing to see the \"Root image\" header because if we are loading a container repository with a name, this header gets replaced once the loading is done:\n\n![Screenshot_2021-03-25_at_12.28.06](/uploads/ada1f08d871305a9e7b785f85d66bc9c/Screenshot_2021-03-25_at_12.28.06.png)\n\n### :fire_engine: Solution\n\nHide the \"Root image\" header during loading.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-25T11:29:32.637Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T20:51:19.436Z","closed_at":"2021-09-10T09:04:45.868Z","closed_by":{"id":4584738,"username":"nmezzopera","name":"Nicolò Maria Mezzopera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4584738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmezzopera"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::package","frontend","group::package registry","section::ops","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

I would like to add this to the `CiJob` type.\n\nIf it is also possible to calculate on the backend whether all jobs are stage-based (and therefore the whole pipeline is) and report that on the `Pipeline` type, that would be amazing, but we can calculate on the frontend if necessary.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-24T11:39:13.739Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T14:27:01.014Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T14:27:00.893Z","closed_by":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"labels":["backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"},{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"}],"author":{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":109884,"username":"sarahghp","name":"Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3a4be73ec22c01a87b77ddc2bb6f7d?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sarahghp"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325822","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/325822","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/325822/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/325822/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#325822","relative":"#325822","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#325822"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":81552987,"iid":325814,"project_id":278964,"title":"Container repository updated at field never gets updated","description":"Follow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262639#note_536288304\n\n### :fire: ~bug \n\nThe container repository details page displays a `Last updated` field in the header.\n\nExample: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/container_registry/1041238\n\nThe value of that field comes from an object on the rails side that is never updated = this value can confuse the users.\n\n### :fire_engine: Solutions\n\n1.
