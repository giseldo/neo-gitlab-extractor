[{"id":113270258,"iid":370702,"project_id":278964,"title":"Don't create `EE::Member` audit events when there is no change","description":"\n\n## Problem to solve\n\nRight now audit events are created to whenever certain APIs are\ncalled. This is great for maintaining visibility whenever actions\ntake place. However, it means that audit events are always created,\neven when no change has occurred. This can cause the audit log to be\nfilled with events that aren't meaningful. See the screenshot on the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8547)\nfor an example where no actual changed occurred, yet an event was\ncreated.\n\nThe audit event located in the\n[`EE::Members::UpdateService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/services/ee/members/update_service.rb) might exhibit this\nbehavior\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nWhen an audit event is about to be created, check that there actually\nwas a change. If there was, create the event if normal. However, if no\nchange actually occurred, do not create an audit event.\n\n-   [x] add a spec for [`EE::Members::UpdateService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/services/ee/members/update_service.rb) to check against the described behavior\n-   [x] if the spec fails, make it pass","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-15T04:46:00.808Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T02:26:12.891Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T19:08:56.747Z","closed_by":{"id":11881043,"username":"wandering_person","name":"Michael

epics\"","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen viewing the [roadmap](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/roadmap/) for a group, attempting to filter using \"milestone\" shows the error \"Something went wrong while fetching epics\" and no data is returned. \n\nWhen looking at the network log in the browser tools, there is a GraphQL request to `roadmapGroupEpics` returning a 500 error. Taking a look at Kibana, I was able to find the error-ing request in the logs, and it looks like there's a PostgreSQL error at the root of it:\n\n```\nPG::AmbiguousColumn: ERROR:  column reference \"start_date\" is ambiguous\nLINE 1: ...SE OR \"epics\".\"confidential\" = TRUE AND 1=0) AND (start_date...\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Pick any group that has epics in use. [GitLab.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org) is one I was able to replicate with!\n- In the sidebar go to **Epics \u003e Roadmap** and see some data is loaded.\n- When viewing the roadmap, click in the filter / search box and select \"Milestone = \" and pick any milestone to filter on, I just picked 15.3 since I know that should be an active one for the GitLab group.\n- See a red banner with \"Something went wrong while fetching epics\", and in the network tools in the browser you can see the GraphQL request has a 500.\n\n### Example Project\n\nI didn't make a custom project since I could replicate in any project with epics, it doesn't seem to require any specific setup.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nFiltering by milestone returns an error instead of actual data.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nEpics in the roadmap can be filtered by milestone, much like you can filter by label or author (and those seem to work okay currently).\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nHere's a picture of the error itself:\n\n![GitLab.org group showing error when searching by milestone](/uploads/ca035c4a2c4042d646c69b01647c0e8c/Screen_Shot_2022-08-12_at_14.21.49.png)\n\nThis is a link to the Kibana log line for my replication showing the PostgreSQL error (accessible for GitLab team members):\n\nhttps://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/discover#/doc/7092c4e2-4eb5-46f2-8305-a7da2edad090/pubsub-rails-inf-gprd-012644?id=xqRIk4IBExTeCTjeEOao\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com (hence I also removed the next two sections about application / environment checks).\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nLooks like it's something in the way we're doing the SQL join, so I'd guess we have to alter that to not have two things with the same column name.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-12T18:29:10.940Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T12:00:47.330Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T11:22:53.308Z","closed_by":{"id":12044147,"username":"sdobrovolschii","name":"Stanislav Dobrovolschii","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12044147/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sdobrovolschii"},"labels":["Deliverable","customer","devops::plan","epics","group::product planning","milestones","reproduced on GitLab.com","roadmaps","section::dev","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":12044147,"username":"sdobrovolschii","name":"Stanislav Dobrovolschii","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12044147/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sdobrovolschii"}],"author":{"id":5461018,"username":"kchappell","name":"Kaitlyn Chappell","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/055da6acd1f2f9f5ceeefb4601d192e9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kchappell"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":12044147,"username":"sdobrovolschii","name":"Stanislav Dobrovolschii","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12044147/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sdobrovolschii"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370630","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370630","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370630/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370630/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#370630","relative":"#370630","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#370630"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":113212170,"iid":370623,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Validate with latest vendored patch schema version\"","description":"The following discussion from !94265 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @subashis started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/94265#note_1054809071):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **suggestion (non-blocking)** This spec block is similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/94265/diffs#d6b819f1a8babe28c2d8d518e089d8cca1b273a4_71_71.

table or create new table to keep dedicated set of settings. I identified some columns that in my opinion are good candidates for moving. I did a quick research on each - it does not mean I'm 100% confident that the move will be easy :(.\n\nSome of the columns, for example description-related columns, because of how wide they are - moving them will benefit performance and make this table less busy.\n\nRight now, this is particularly visible while using 'GroupFinder' - every call to this class is loading all 49 columns of namespaces table.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82958 there was new table (`namespace_detailes`) implemented. To switch from using `namespaces` table columns we need to create batched migration to move the content of the namespace table's rows into the new table. \n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. Create the column in the `namespace_settings` table.\n1. Setup ActiveRecord callback to keep the value up to date between `namespace` and `namespace_settings`\n1. Add a special index that allows iterating over the records. (`create index i1 on namespace (id) where your_field is not null`)\n1. **Implement and trigger background migration.**\n1. Release N+1: Update the backend to persist the column only in the `namespace_settings` table.\n1. Release N+1: Ignore the column in the `namespace` table.\n1. Release N+2: Remove the column from `namespace` following our [DB guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/migration_style_guide.html#example-add-a-column-my_column-to-the-users-table).\n\n## Availability and Testing\n- Run `package-and-qa` job and evaluate results for any issues related to these database changes. Feel free to ping @vburton if there are any questions on QA test failures.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-12T07:56:09.168Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T12:02:39.200Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T07:31:28.157Z","closed_by":{"id":11648098,"username":"hraghuvanshi","name":"Hitesh

The behavior outlined in this issue is present on GitLab.com SaaS and GitLab Omnibus 15.2.2.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a job within a project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that should not run during deploy freeze periods. We can simply use the example in the [documentation here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html#prevent-unintentional-releases-by-setting-a-deploy-freeze):\n\n    ```yaml\n    deploy_to_production:\n      stage: deploy\n      script: deploy_to_prod.sh\n      rules:\n    - if: $CI_DEPLOY_FREEZE == null\n    ```\n\n1. [Configure a deploy freeze period](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html#prevent-unintentional-releases-by-setting-a-deploy-freeze) on the project matching the following examples (with any suitable adjustments for the current time when testing).\n\n1. Try to trigger/create new pipelines - you'll notice that the deploy freeze will not apply in all cases of valid cron syntax usage for the freeze period.\n\n4. For the examples below, the current date/time of testing is `Thu Aug 11 08:00:00 UTC 2022` and we try to configure a variety of different freeze start times, which behave accordingly:\n\n    - **Not working - _jobs that should be subject to the deploy freeze will run anyway_** \n        1. Freeze start `* * * 8 *` \u0026 freeze end `* * * 10 *`\n            - The expectation is that the freeze start would trigger [“At every minute in August.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_8_*), which covers the current time period, and would continue to trigger for every remaining minute in the month of August. The end time is [“At every minute in October.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_10_*) so we're still within the deploy freeze period.\n\n        1. Freeze start `1 9 * 8 *` \u0026 freeze end `* * * 10 *`\n            - The expectation is that the freeze start would apply from [\"09:01 in August.”](https://crontab.guru/#1_9_*_8_*) and end [“At every minute in October.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_10_*). The start time has already passed, and we should still currently be within the deploy freeze period before it ends.\n\n        1. Freeze start `1 9 * 8 1` \u0026 freeze end `* * * 10 *`\n            - The expectation is that the freeze start would apply [\"At 09:01 on Mondays in August”](https://crontab.guru/#1_9_*_8_1) and end [“At every minute in October.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_10_*). The start time has already passed, and we should still currently be within the deploy freeze period before it ends.\n\n    - **Does work - _jobs that should be subject to the deploy freeze will _not_ run_**\n\n        1. Freeze start `* * * 7 *` \u0026 Freeze end `* * * 10 *`\n            - The expectation is that the freeze start would trigger [\"At every minute in July.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_7_*) and end [“At every minute in October.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_10_*). The start time has already passed, and we should still currently be within the deploy freeze period before it ends.\n\n        1. Freeze start `1 9 1 8 *` \u0026 Freeze end `* * * 10 *`\n            - The expectation is that the freeze start would apply from [\"09:01 on day-of-month 1 in August.”](https://crontab.guru/#1_9_1_8_*) and end [“At every minute in October.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_10_*). The start time has already passed, and we should still currently be within the deploy freeze period before it ends.\n\n### Example Project\n\nAn example `.gitlab-ci.yml` file used for testing is available here:\n- https://gitlab.com/jamesreed/deployfreeze-cron-demo/-/blob/567474203fa94d15ceeda839d6af4164b8fbe0e8/.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nExample pipeline runs that were created after setting each of the aforementioned freeze periods can be found here:\n- https://gitlab.com/jamesreed/deployfreeze-cron-demo/-/pipelines\n\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen configuring [Deploy freezes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html#prevent-unintentional-releases-by-setting-a-deploy-freeze), the `Freeze start` time doesn't always apply as expected, depending on the [cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/) that has been used to set the freeze period.\n\nIt's as though the `Freeze start` will only apply if the cron syntax specifies a time period that won't repeat \"within\" the specified freeze period, relative to the current time.\n\nFor example - Freeze start `* * * 7 *` to start [\"At every minute in July.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_7_*) \u0026 Freeze end `* * * 10 *` [“At every minute in October.”](https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_10_*) will work when we're currently in August, and relative to the current time (August) this is a time that has absolutely passed already upon the first check of this syntax, and the freeze start won't repeat between now and the end time.\n\nThe common factor in the examples that don't work as expected seems to be that the freeze start will trigger multiple times before the freeze end time is reached, or more specifically it's that the [next freeze end time _will not_ be triggered _before_ the next freeze start time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/freeze_period_status.rb#L30), so we aren't considered as being \"within the freeze period\".\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nDeploy freeze times should work congruently to the defined cron syntax. I believe all of the examples mentioned in this issue _should_ work but currently don't.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- The [freeze period logic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/freeze_period_status.rb#L15-L31) may need to be modified so that the different variations of cron schedules used to set the freeze period can work as expected.\n\n- There are a couple of open issues that could potentially address this behavior if they're implemented in a way that limits the possible freeze period configuration to those that we know will work as intended.\n\n    - [Deploy freeze: show human-readable Cron messages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212458/)\n    - [Specify specific

GFM references rendered in Jira issue description leak private/confidential resources","description":"**[HackerOne report #1653149](https://hackerone.com/reports/1653149)** by `yvvdwf` on 2022-07-28, assigned to @ngeorge1:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\nHi,\n\nGitlab allows integrating Jira issues whose descriptions are rendered using GFM. However the descriptions are not redacted. Consequently the priviate/confidential information are leaked to unauthorized users.\n\nThis report is basically the same as [the previous report](https://hackerone.com/reports/1652853). They are the same model of exploitation but their root causes are different. Indeed the Jira descriptions are managed by `JiraGfmPipeline` pipeline.\n\n\n###  Steps to reproduce:\n\nRequirements:\n\n- access to a premium subscription (no problem on GitLab.com as there are free trials, they work great for the attack)  \n- a Jira server. I used a cloud Jira instance on atlassian.com\n\nAs a normal user (victim):\n\n- create a private project, let's call `victim/project-a`,  then create a confidential issue inside. It's GFM reference is now `victim/project-a#1`\n\nAs an attacker which has a premium subscription (e.g., via free trials):\n\n- In an existing project or create a new one  \n- Go to `Settings/Integrations` and select `Jira`. Follow the [guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/issues.html#view-jira-issues) to fill the form to enable viewing Jira issues in the project.  \n- Login Jira, create an issue on the dashboard by fillting `victim/project-a#1` into the `Description` textbox.  \n- Go back to Gitlab web to view the issue you've created, .e.g., in `Issues/Jira issues` then select the issue  \n- Right click on the link of `victim/project-a#1` to view its source code. You should see the title of the issue created by the victim.  \n- Below is an example when I used `gitlab-org/gitlab#363725` as payload which is used to track one of my H1 reports.\n\n![jira-pipeline.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/6d32746b-ae58-4f72-8fbb-dc17c3c88179/jira-pipeline.png)\n\n###  Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows to renders *all* GFM references, such as, merged requests, issues, etc, even if they are private or confidential.\n\nFor example, attackers can simply scan through all *issue* numbers (starting from 1) of the `gitlab-org/gitlab` project, and thus leaking their titles.\n\nBest regards,  \nyvvdwf\n\n####  Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows attacker to access to *all private or confidential* GFM references, such as, merged requests,

currently behind the `execute_build_hooks_inline` feature flag.\n\nThis enables the computation of web-hook payloads when the events are triggered, and not when they are consumed from the by the job-hooks worker.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::integrations\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_ecosystem_integrations`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @alexkalderimis \n- PM: @g.hickman \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect the number of occasions where stale data is seen in pipeline build hooks to decrease.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nResource consumption in pipeline workers (especially the pipeline finished worker) could become unacceptable.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- [Sidekiq overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/sidekiq-main/sidekiq-overview?orgId=1)\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\nProduction errors are not anticipated, but any errors would include reference to the `Ci::Build.execute_hooks` method.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status f6c5c15d`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set execute_build_hooks_inline true --dev --staging --staging-ref`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status f6c5c15d`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com execute_build_hooks_inline true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366755) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set execute_build_hooks_inline \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set execute_build_hooks_inline \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set execute_build_hooks_inline true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366755) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a [merge request](gitlab-org/gitlab!95712) to remove `execute_build_hooks_inline` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366755) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete execute_build_hooks_inline --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Create a follow-up issue to remove the worker https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370387#note_1057860468.\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set execute_build_hooks_inline false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-10T15:30:22.686Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T16:12:13.542Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T16:12:13.520Z","closed_by":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"labels":["Deliverable","feature flag","feature::addition","missed-deliverable","missed:15.3","release post item","release post item::secondary","type::maintenance","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"}],"author":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3614858,"username":"alexkalderimis","name":"Alex Kalderimis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3614858/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexkalderimis"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370387","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":31,"completed_count":28},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"28 of 31 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370387","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370387/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370387/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#370387","relative":"#370387","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#370387"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113077052,"iid":370373,"project_id":278964,"title":"Recreate Redis Counters using Snowplow events - Phase 2: Wave 5b -FE EVENTS","description":"## Summary\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7493, we instrumented the first set of Redis Counters using Snowplow events in SaaS.

User can select options from as many groups as they wish.\n2. User can select only one option from each group (eg: either `Still detected` or `No longer detected` can be checked, but not both).\n3. Clicking a selected option will deselect and remove that group from the query.\n4. Unselecting all options will reset the default with `All Activity` checked. \n5. Clicking `All Activity` will reset and uncheck all options.\n\n~backend confirmed the current GraphQL query supports the parameters and structure we need. See https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7883#note_954189436\n\nCurrently supported filters:\n\n1. Detection\n   - Still detected\n   - No longer detected \n2.

Understandably, this is because Feature Flags is the first section within Deployments, but it would probably make more sense for the hierarchy here to follow the experience through the Release Stage. New users might get confused as to why deployments automatically drops them into Feature Flags.

We should only measure the _changed_ LFS objects of the new project to count against their storage limit\n1. We should ideally deduplicate the actual stored LFS content, so we do not replicate it for every fork. This could also accelerate the process of forking, along with reducing cost. (Similar to pool repositories)\n\n\n##### How others handle LFS\n\nIt looks like GitHub attributes the forked project's changed LFS objects back to the parent project: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/collaboration-with-git-large-file-storage.

Week 1: The lease is reduced to 1h, performance is observed\n1. Week 2: If nothing comes up, the lease is reduced to .5h, performance is observed\n1. Week 3: If nothing comes up, the lease is removed\n\n_Note: these are merely ballpark timing suggestions, they can be adjusted if necessary_\n\n# Additional notes\n\n- We should make use of feature flags to control this effort so that if a negative impact is observed we can quickly and easily revert the lease reduction\n- We should identify metrics to monitor so we can effectively determine if the lease reduction has been successful or not\n- Before the lease can be removed entirely, we should ensure the worker is idempotent, as noted [in this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369091#note_1054281166).\n- As we approach removing the lease, a dedicated queue could be created for this, allowing the sidekiq jobs to be executed by a specific infra fleet. You may need to talk with someone from Scalability about this\n- We can consider using deduplication and read-only replicas to improve performance, more details are here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369091#note_1054281166","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-09T11:07:29.180Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T14:23:19.802Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T14:23:19.558Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","group::utilization","type::maintenance","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370209","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370209","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370209/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/370209/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#370209","relative":"#370209","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#370209"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112993138,"iid":370206,"project_id":278964,"title":"Merge i18n translations (September 2022)","description":"Merge the latest i18n translations from Crowdin on a monthly cadence.\n\nDocumentation available here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/i18n/merging_translations.html\n\n#### ToDo\n* [x] After cloning: update Title, set Milestone, Due date (15th), Related to previous month's issue.\n* [x] After the 1st of the month: assign to yourself, set ~\"workflow::in dev\" \n* [x] If needed, configure the [GitLab-Crowdin integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/i18n/merging_translations.html#recreate-the-gitlab-integration-in-crowdin)\n* [x] Kick off a sync from [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gitlab-ee/apps/system/gitlab)\n* [x] Find the [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all\u0026utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026state=opened\u0026author_username=gitlab-crowdin-bot) created by @gitlab-crowdin-bot and associate it with this issue\n* [x] Complete the MR\n* [x] Update the translation levels [data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/i18n.rb#L43) with the latest numbers.

Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_pipeline_execution`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the

flag.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ask for review and merge it.\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/96190 15.4`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346400) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 60421eae5ef1e0b67eefed600b71f67fae23b416`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete ci_forked_source_public_cost_factor --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_forked_source_public_cost_factor false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-08T19:21:02.615Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T23:41:33.360Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T14:26:33.637Z","closed_by":{"id":4626651,"username":"allison.browne","name":"Allison

between legacy and new Web IDE","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nAs we develop the new Web IDE, we want to get feedback early from both internal and external sources. Putting the new Web IDE experience behind a feature flag allows us to have the new codebase in the main GitLab project early on, but for those who have the feature flag enabled, they may be left with an incomplete editing experience.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Add a toggle in the User’s preference page to switch to the legacy Web IDE. The new Web IDE is enabled by default once we turn on the feature flag.\n- Display a user callout enticing the user to try the new Web IDE on the project’s overview page. The user callout should only appear once.\n  * The goal is just to get users to try it out, not to communicate critical information about the status or how to switch back\n  * The critical information already shows up as soon as users open it, no matter from which place\n  * Overloading the UI with this in different places could feel like advertisement Once dismissed, or if the user already visited the Web IDE, it should also not pop up again.\n- Create a welcome page in the new Web IDE that displays a link to the User’s preferences page where the user can turn off the new Web IDE.\n\n| User preferences | New Web IDE callout box | Web IDE Welcome screen |\n|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| ![user_preferences_switch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/dbd3e669214da6c0a31dffa7fb69fbee/user_preferences_switch.png) | ![new_web_ide_callout](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/6d6be2a5bc4fd3a0fe48bec1ab201364/new_web_ide_callout.png) | ![new_web_ide_welcome_screen](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/05f83f5b0d86a05850193b59b273482f/new_web_ide_welcome_screen.png) |\n\n### Feature rollout\n\nWe will follow a phased rollout approach where we will incrementally enable the new Web IDE in gitlab.com. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process for more information.\n\n### Instrumentation\n\nUntil we have full instrumentation of the new Web IDE, we should at least collect a snowplow event that indicates how many users have interacted with the toggle and tried the new Web IDE.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Can we do this on a user level? Or would it have to be at a project/group level?\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\n_This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Exploration of the logs indicates that this is due to\n\n```json\n  \"exception.class\": \"NoMethodError\",\n  \"exception.message\": \"undefined method `unique_project_download_limit' for #\u003cNamespaceSetting:0x00007f1831b43250\u003e\"\n```\n\nThis can be resolved with `gitlab-ctl restart` but this violates the premise of a zero downtime upgrade.\n\nThis is a customer reported issue on [Zendesk ticket 312260](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/312260) (GitLab internal link)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Deploy an Omnibus Geo pair (one primary site, one secondary site) on GitLab 15.1.2\n2. Ensure that `gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check` on both sites succeeds without errors\n3. Follow the [zero downtime upgrade](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/zero_downtime.html#geo-deployment) steps exactly as written\n4. Ignore the `WARNING` message when running `gitlab-rake db:migrate:geo` on the secondary (see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369874) for more info)\n5. From the web UI, attempt to create a new group or subgroup\n6. Observe the `500` error that is returned\n7. (Optional) Search for the full error text in the logs with `grep -e \"\u003crequest_id\u003e\" /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/production_json.log`\n   * Note: The log message is in unformatted json. Consider using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or something similar to format it for readability. \n\n### Example Project\n\nSince this only affects self-managed deployments of GitLab, no example project is available\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGroup creation from the web UI fails with error `500`, and the gitlab-rails log shows an exception class and message of:\n\n```json\n  \"exception.class\": \"NoMethodError\",\n  \"exception.message\": \"undefined method `unique_project_download_limit' for #\u003cNamespaceSetting:0x00007f1831b43250\u003e\"\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGroup creation should succeed after a zero downtime upgrade and should not require a restart of additional services to function, since this violates the premise of a zero downtime upgrade.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for the JSON output of the error from `gitlab-rails/production_json.log`\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n{\n  \"method\":

gem","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369976, we created PoC script allows delivery of emails using [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail) with [OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow).\n\nIn the scope of this issue we want to create gem `microsoft_graph_mailer`, based on the script. We are not going to publish this gem on https://rubygems.org/ for now. We are going to create this gem as a [GitLab-created gem](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gemfile.html#gitlab-created-gems) and put it into `vendor/gems` folder.\n\nThat gem should also implement integration with ActionMailer. It should allow configuring the GitLab app in the following way:\n\n```ruby\nActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :microsoft_graph\n\nActionMailer::Base.microsoft_graph_settings = {\n  user_id: \"YOUR-USER-ID\",\n  tenant: \"YOUR-TENANT-ID\",\n  client_id: \"YOUR-CLIENT-ID\",\n  client_secret: \"YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET-ID\"\n  # Defaults to \"https://login.microsoftonline.com\".\n  azure_ad_endpoint: \"https://login.microsoftonline.us\",\n  # Defaults to \"https://graph.microsoft.com\".\n  graph_endpoint: \"https://graph.microsoft.us\"\n}\n```\n\nExample to follow how to create gem in `vendor/gems` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/57805.\n\n## Microsoft Graph configuration\n\nTo use the Microsoft Graph API to send mails, you will\nneed to create an application in the Azure Active Directory. See the\n[Microsoft instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) for more details:\n\n1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).\n1. Search for and select `Azure Active Directory`.\n1. Under `Manage`, select `App registrations` \u003e `New registration`.\n1. Enter a `Name` for your application, such as `MicrosoftGraphMailer`. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.\n1. If `Supported account types` is listed, select the appropriate option.\n1. Leave `Redirect URI` blank. This is not needed.\n1. Select `Register`.\n1. Under `Manage`, select `Certificates \u0026 secrets`.\n1. Under `Client secrets`, select `New client secret`, and enter a name.\n1. Under `Expires`, select `Never`, unless you plan on updating the credentials every time it expires.\n1. Select `Add`. Record the secret value in a safe location for use in a later step.\n1. Under `Manage`, select `API Permissions` \u003e `Add a permission`. Select `Microsoft Graph`.\n1. Select `Application permissions`.\n1. Under the `Mail` node, select `Mail.Send`. Then select Add permissions.\n1. If `User.Read` is listed in the permission list, you can delete this.\n1. Click `Grant admin consent` for these permissions.\n\n- `user_id` - The unique identifier for the user. To use Microsoft Graph on behalf of the user.\n- `tenant` - The directory tenant the application plans to operate against, in GUID or domain-name format.\n- `client_id` - The application ID that's assigned to your app. You can find this information in the portal where you registered your app.\n- `client_secret` - The client secret that you generated for your app in the app registration portal.\n\n## GitLab configuration\n\nRelated to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365524","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-05T13:00:57.709Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:02:17.831Z","closed_at":"2022-09-16T12:01:27.408Z","closed_by":{"id":4554599,"username":"m_gill","name":"Michelle Gill","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4554599/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_gill"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Deliverable","backend","customer","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","maintenance::refactor","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"}],"author":{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369980","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369980","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369980/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369980/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#369980","relative":"#369980","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#369980"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8259,"epic":{"id":548348,"iid":8259,"title":"Support delivery of emails using Microsoft Graph API with OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8259","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112847023,"iid":369976,"project_id":278964,"title":"Create a PoC to support Microsoft Graph API email sending","description":"Related to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8259\n\nThis issue aims to create a gem to send emails using Microsoft Graph API + OAuth2 authentication.

sources","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps. They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic. Once created, an implementation issue is usually refined in order to populate and review the\nimplementation plan and weight.\nExample workflow: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\u003c!--\nA brief explanation of the why, not the what or how. Assume the reader doesn't know the\nbackground and won't have time to dig-up information from comment threads.\n--\u003e\n\nIn the initial implementation for [the source parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/21c3d652f6ce58ee67f37c1b6ce2602bbef72020/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/sbom/source/dependency_scanning.rb#L42) we used a SHA-256 digest of the data, converted to JSON. There are multiple problems with this.\n\n1. JSON is malleable. It's possible that the same data could produce different JSONs.\n2. [There are performance concerns with `to_json`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/93219#note_1050426113)\n\nOnce we begin populating the data into the DB, we will be hard-pressed to change the fingerprinting scheme.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_stop_expanding_file_vars_for_runners false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-04T19:43:30.678Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T12:08:07.091Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T18:31:30.572Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline authoring","maintenance::refactor","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369907","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":46,"completed_count":8},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"8 of 46 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369907","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369907/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369907/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#369907","relative":"#369907","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#369907"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":72239,"iid":86,"sequence":27,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-07-25T00:05:01.895Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T00:05:02.250Z","start_date":"2022-10-17","due_date":"2022-10-30","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/72239"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":112812583,"iid":369902,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo Replicable - Incorrect color used for Failed Sync on Registries","description":"## What / Why\n\nIntroduced here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/90923\n\nWe are using orange rather than red for the failed state on Replicables.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance.
