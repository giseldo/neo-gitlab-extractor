variables","description":"### Summary\n\nThe API Security scanner supports two database backends, sql and postgresql. An undocumented environment variable allows switching between the two for testing/development purposes. The name of this environment variable (`DB_TYPE`) is generic enough as to have conflicts with users configurations causing failures of API Security.\n\nThe issue was found through a customer support case where the scanner never starts causing the job to fail. It looks like the customer has a global variable `DB_TYPE` set for their own existing jobs. When they tried to configure DAST API it caused the scanner background process to fail with an unknown database type error.\n\nZendesk Ticket: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/247646\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set `DB_TYPE` global variable to `mysql`.\n1. Run API Security products (DAST API or API Fuzzing)\n1. Notice scanner service doesn't start\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAPI Security job fails waiting for scanner to become available.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAPI Security job is able to start a session with the scanner.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1. [x] Rename the environment variable to `API_SECURITY_DEV_DB_TYPE`\n1. [x] Release new container\n1. [x] Add to troubleshooting guide with version guidance","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-09T17:41:35.739Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T16:47:24.122Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T16:47:24.108Z","closed_by":{"id":6121997,"username":"mikeeddington","name":"Michael

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/74095) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `multiple_gpg_signatures`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `multiple_gpg_signatures` feature flag.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

loading Monaco","description":"At the moment we have two ways of loading Monaco:\n\n  - the modern one, where we explicitly import `monaco` in the modules requiring it, and\n  - the legacy one where some modules assume `monaco` to be a global object living in the global namespace.\n\nThe second approach was the default one previously. After [upgrading Moanco](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63400) in %\"14.1\" the default way of adding Monaco is to explicitly import it where needed. During the upgrade, to support the existing use cases, we have introduced the `globalAPI: true` [option for the MonacoWebpackPlugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/webpack.config.js#L457) which does put monaco in the global namespace as well.\n\nSo, technically, now we can face (and it seems like we do face) the conflicts when two versions of Monaco are available at the same time (one explicitly imported and another one from the global namespace) which might lead to all sorts of potential conflicts and race conditions.\n\nThis issue aims at solving the problem by:\n\n  - switching all use cases to explicitly import `monaco`\n  - remove the `globalAPI: true` \"hack\" from the webpack configuration","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-09T09:28:05.416Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T12:01:48.018Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T20:56:43.759Z","closed_by":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"labels":["Deliverable","Development Department","Source Editor","devops::create","frontend","group::editor","missed-deliverable","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","section::dev","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"}],"author":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3199302,"username":"dmishunov","name":"Denys Mishunov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d85e45af29611ac2c1395e3c3d6ec5d6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dmishunov"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345219","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345219","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345219/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345219/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345219","relative":"#345219","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345219"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4861,"epic":{"id":141955,"iid":4861,"title":"GitLab Source Editor | Strategy","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4861","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96990220,"iid":345217,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add hint about short expiries on token to group import","description":"### Problem\n\nAs mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/import/backend/discussion/-/issues/9#note_727309376, we should be adding adding tooltips / informative messages to the Group Import page to suggest that users set short expiries on tokens they create for Import.

It seems that doing so causes an infinite loop in the query. I am still unsure *why* that specific call created the infinite loop :thinking: Because we were only using the `ERROR` status at one place, I removed it entirely and used a different approach for the component that needed to know about that error.

fails when NuGet packages.lock.json contains ProjectReference nodes","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nDependency Scanning job fails to scan a NuGet `packages.lock.json` when:\n- It has nodes where the `type` is `\"Project\"` (project references).\n- A project node is referenced in the `dependencies` of another project node.\n- The names don't match because the case isn't the case.\n\nIn this case the analyzer fails with a `cannot find nuget dependency` error, because the project node referenced in `dependencies` has no match.\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \".NETCoreApp,Version=v5.0\": {\n      \"dep1\": {\n        \"type\": \"Project\",\n        \"dependencies\": {\n          \"Dep2\": \"1.0.0\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"dep2\": {\n        \"type\": \"Project\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Further details\n\nRight now the [file parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.11/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget.go#L29) assumes that a `packages.lock.json` is made of `Direct` nodes or `Transitive` nodes. `Project` nodes are handled like `Transitive` nodes.\n\n`packages.lock.json` defines 4 dependency types: `Direct`, `Transitive`, `Project`, and `CentralTransitive`.\n\nLinks:\n\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6.2.0.80/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.ProjectModel/ProjectLockFile/PackageDependencyType.cs#L21\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6.2.0.80/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.ProjectModel/ProjectLockFile/LockFileDependency.cs#L23\n- https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/6.2.0.80/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.ProjectModel/ProjectLockFile/PackagesLockFileFormat.cs#L220\n\n### Example project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/kriwaaga-public/gitlab/gemnasium-dotnet-projectreference-bug/-/jobs/1769022564#L28\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCreate a .NET project with a generated `packages.lock.json` file that contains references to other projects, and where the case is different.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job fails:\n\n```\n$ /analyzer run\n[INFO] [Gemnasium] [2021-10-21T14:35:51Z] ▶ GitLab Gemnasium analyzer v2.29.9\n[INFO] [Gemnasium] [2021-10-21T14:35:53Z] ▶ Using commit xxxxx\n of vulnerability database\n[FATA] [Gemnasium] [2021-10-21T14:35:53Z] ▶ cannot find nuget dependency: Example.Project.A\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nScanning job doesn't fail.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- Change the NuGet [lock file parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.11/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget.go#L29) to exclude `ProjectReference` entries, that is entries where the `type` is `Project`.\n- Don't skip `Project` nodes, but make ignore the case when resolving their `dependencies`.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Change the [NuGet lock file parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v2.29.11/scanner/parser/nuget/nuget.go#L29)\n   - Process `Project` nodes as direct dependencies.\n   - Ignore case when resolving package names.\n   - Cover this in parser unit tests.\n- [x] Release new version.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-08T13:05:53.090Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T05:37:31.705Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T07:29:27.745Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien

Just like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\n### Context\n\nWhen you publish a Conan package, you can simply use the `package-name/version` or the full recipe: `package-name/version@user/channel`. Based on our interactions with the Conan community, it seems it is much more common for C/C++ developers to use only the package name and version when publishing Conan packages.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe problem is that GitLab only accepts the full recipe. This means that C/C++ developers need to customize their package naming conventions just to use GitLab. For many of our customers, this is a deal-breaker.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow developers to publish Conan packages with name/version only, which is the more commonly used convention. This change will only impact those using the project-level endpoint, as the instance-level packages rely on the `user` in `pkg/version@user/channel` to identify the target project\n\n#### Further details\n\nCheck out the result of the technical investigation for further details. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345054#results-of-the-investigation\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-05T16:51:50.244Z","updated_at":"2021-12-28T07:56:51.237Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T09:33:12.301Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Conan Repository","Deliverable","Package:P1","auto updated","backend","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","package:active","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345055","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345055","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345055/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345055/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345055","relative":"#345055","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345055"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7093,"epic":{"id":381522,"iid":7093,"title":"Publish Conan packages with only name/version","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7093","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96810718,"iid":345051,"project_id":278964,"title":"Map kics queryName to identifier.name","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\nWe currently use the query uuid in place of an `identifier.name` within our kics analyzer.

However this user experience does NOT provide a solution in case users would like downstream pipelines to pick up a new pipeline code. Resubmitting the whole parent pipeline from the MR is possible, but it also reruns all the other pipelines, not only the one affected one.\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal here is to show the trigger job page without the logs. This behavior would resemble how we currently show the manual jobs before they are executed.\n\n### Outcome\n\n- A trigger job page with an empty state instead of the logs and a link to the downstream pipeline that the job triggered. The downstream pipeline should open in the same tab, but user should be able to right-click on the button and open the downstream pipeline page in a new tab if they wish.\n- The \"Retry\" button should retry the trigger job and update the job status to running.\n\n:link: [Trigger job illustration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/blob/main/illustrations/job-trigger-md.svg)\n\n![image](/uploads/6a16cc76d8b859cc721e7d29ae91243d/image.png)\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n|Iteration| Description | Link |\n|--| ------ | ------ |\n|-|DESIGN/DISCUSSION | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343256, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352000, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353049, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340194 |\n|1|BACKEND: Add route for show page | :white_check_mark:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347060 |\n|1|FRONTEND: Create show page | :white_check_mark: :point_left: **You are here** |\n|1|BACKEND: Add functionality for retry button no 1 (retry bridge job; re-create new downstream pipeline)| https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345050 :point_left: ~\"workflow::in review\" | \n|1|FRONTEND: Add button no 1 and tie it to the functionality (retry bridge job; re-create new downstream pipeline)|https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350243 :point_left: ~\"workflow::blocked\"  |\n|1| FRONTEND: Redirect old trigger jobs to the latest trigger job | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352472 ~\"workflow::blocked\"\n|1|FRONTEND: Only show latest downstream pipeline and trigger job in the pipeline graphs| https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352124 ~\"workflow::blocked\"\n|2|BACKEND: Add functionality for retry button no 2 (retry failed/canceled jobs)| :white_check_mark: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348904\n|2|FRONTEND: Add split button and tie it to the functionality (retry failed/canceled jobs) |https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32559 ~\"workflow::in dev\"|\n|3|BACKEND: Add functionality for retrying from the graph (or what we say is iteration 3)| https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323470 ~\"workflow::blocked\"  |\n|3|FRONTEND: Add button/icon for retrying from graph| ? |","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-05T15:27:33.842Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T14:48:44.520Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T14:48:44.495Z","closed_by":{"id":9468400,"username":"marknuzzo","name":"Mark Nuzzo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9468400/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/marknuzzo"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","FY23::Q2","OKR","Technical Writing","UX","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","backend-weight::1","candidate::14.6","devops::verify","documentation","frontend","frontend-weight::3","group::pipeline authoring","missed:14.6","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

We probably want to use some IaC tool to implement this.\n\nFor example there's a GitLab provider and a \n\n# Implementation Plan\n\n* We bundle the [existing installation script](https://gitlab.com/bwill/network-alerts-quick-start/-/blob/e8701c68be83f560ecca25c87b3f0742e647930e/install.sh) as an image which includes the utilities we need (gcloud, kubectl, helm, etc).\n\n* We create documentation on (1) how to use the script, ie. required parameters, (2) the effects of the script, ie. what it does on behalf of the user.\n\n* Question is if we want to create the cluster on behalf of the user too, or if we assume people bring their own, and we only provision it.\n\n* If we want to create the cluster, we can do so as follows:\n\n    ```\n    gcloud container clusters create $NAME --region $REGION\n    gcloud container clusters get-credentials $NAME --region $REGION\n    ```\n\n    We need to prompt the user for cluster name and region, or accept additional flags.\n\n* ~~Currently, the script attempts to install Cilium from a helmfile.yaml. Either we need to supply it, or create a [Cilium Helm release for GKE](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.9/gettingstarted/k8s-install-gke/) with helm directly.~~\n\n## CI\n\n* General idea is to run the script and feed it parameters that don't clash across branches. For example, the name of the cluster to create would include a commit hash, branch name, etc.\n* In a mandatory teardown step, we always destroy the created cluster.\n* To authenticate to GCP, we create a GCP Service Account with narrowed-down permissions and store it in a CI variable. We authenticate gcloud(1) with it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-05T14:24:56.105Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T03:21:34.728Z","closed_at":"2022-03-24T14:38:24.544Z","closed_by":{"id":9878214,"username":"bauerdominic","name":"Dominic Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9878214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bauerdominic"},"labels":["auto updated","backend","devops::govern","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":9878214,"username":"bauerdominic","name":"Dominic Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9878214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bauerdominic"}],"author":{"id":9878214,"username":"bauerdominic","name":"Dominic Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9878214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bauerdominic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9878214,"username":"bauerdominic","name":"Dominic Bauer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9878214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bauerdominic"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345037","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345037","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345037/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345037/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345037","relative":"#345037","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345037"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96787651,"iid":345026,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Orders harmonization rollout","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [Zuora Orders Harmonization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6641#callout-configuration-changes) on CustomersDot production,\nthat is currently behind the [`orders_harmonization`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/104/edit) feature flag.  The feature flag was originally introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3557.\n\nRelated Enterprise Apps issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/616\n\n### Context\n\nWhen the Orders Harmonization (aka OH) feature is enabled in Zuora, Zuora Orders API can be used to make changes to subscriptions (create new ones, add seats, upgrade plan, etc).  This will be the preferred method for making these changes instead of using the existing Subscribe or Amend Zuora APIs which CustomersDot utilizes currently.  However, with OH enabled, the Subscribe and Amend APIs are still available for use, but they also generate an equivalent Order.  Sales-assisted purchases will use Orders once this is available.\n\nWhen an Order is processed, Zuora will trigger the `Order Processed` callout (because we will have this enabled in our Zuora instance).  If the Subscribe or Amend API is used when OH is enabled, the `Amendment Processed` or `New Subscription Created` callout will still be called.  The `Order Processed` callout will only be processed when the `orders_harmonization` feature flag is enabled.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::provision\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_provision`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @jameslopez @a_luna @tyleramos \n- PM: @courtmeddaugh\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n- @gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen the `orders_harmonization` flag is enabled, the `Order Processed` callout will be processed by the `ZuoraCallout::OrderProcessedWorker` in CustomersDot if the Zuora Orders API is used.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nWe might see some provisioning events missed for subscription updates.  If this happens, we could provision the missed subscription updates manually.  Notify the owners mentioned above if this is observed.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- [Check Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/) for any errors that look related to processing callouts.\n- View the `log/sidekiq.log` on the server to view any processed callout workers.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3569\n- [x] Consider announcing that Orders Harmonization will be enabled in Zuora to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`\n- [x] Get confirmation from @jesssalcido that Orders Harmonization is enabled in Zuora Central Sandbox (test.zuora.com).\n  - [x] Ensure that @jesssalcido has configured the `Order Processed` callout similar to Zuora API Sandbox.\n- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] Navigate to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/104/edit and add `customers-staging` to list of environments.\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected.

[Enable Advanced Search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#enable-advanced-search)\n2.

Add `include:` file links to the pipeline editor","description":"This is a frontend issue for the original proposal based of the original epic\n\n## 🧩 Problem\n\nComplex CI/CD configuration can contain multiple pipelines added to the main config using the `include` keyword. When editing or troubleshooting your config it's difficult to navigate between the `.gitlab-ci-yml` and the included files.\n\nAdditionally, a complex pipeline configuration might contain separate files for downstream pipelines and other files.\n\nEngineers who author pipelines would like to edit all of their pipelines files in one place and take advantage of the pipeline editor features like pipeline visualization, linting, etc.\n\n## :art: Proposal\n\nAs an MVC, we will surface a list of links to the pipeline files added to the config with the `include:` keyword.\n\nFeature acceptance criteria:\n\n* A collapsible files section will contain a list of the includes which will open in a new tab (the file will open in file view in the repo).\n* The `.gitlab-ci.yml` would be highlighted as the currently open file (it won't be clickable as it's already open in the pipeline editor).\n* The other pipeline files will show an external link icon on hover.\n* The file names should be truncated after a certain number of characters, like we do in the [MRs file tree.](https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQu7J4v4) When a file name is truncated, we should show the full file name in a system tooltip on hover (same behavior as in the MRs file tree).\n* When the list of files is long, it should be scrollable.\n* The file tree will open using the \"file tree\" icon button placed above the file tree.\n* When we release the feature, the file tree section will be expanded by default. We should remember the user's selection once they collapse the file tree, so if they collapse it, next time they open the editor it'll be collapsed.\n* When project has a simple one-file pipeline, we'll show a notification inside the files section explaining that pipeline files will appear here.\n* When project doesn't have a pipeline file yet (for example, when you haven't committed the `.gitlab-ci.yml` yet), we won't show the file tree section and the file tree button. We will show the button and the file tree once you commit the file.\n\n#### Mock-up\n\n![File_tree_MVC_design](/uploads/0b9db84f69a94ebfb06ea3712a8e0a3d/File_tree_MVC_design.png)\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\n#### [Full proposal in the design issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339469)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-04T17:01:11.104Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T11:18:00.560Z","closed_at":"2022-01-21T02:07:02.804Z","closed_by":{"id":7598233,"username":"mgandres","name":"Mireya Andres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c96bce45a06f2dd722144db3f52456bf?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mgandres"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","FY23::Q1","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto updated","candidate::14.9","devops::verify","direction","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","quad-planning::ready","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

For example if a user changes the site URL, GitLab will receive an installed event containing a new `baseUrl`.\n\n## Current behavior\n\nJira [lifecycle events](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor/#lifecycle) are used to create or destroy `JiraConnectInstallation`s. But we also receive `installed` events when an installation already exists. Currently, we just ignore those events ([`app/controllers/jira_connect/events_controller.rb:10`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/75dc51f08f57ca41c7d0fe14f1cb8a9c59d6d24e/app/controllers/jira_connect/events_controller.rb#L10)). \n\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe existing installation should be updated with the contents of the [event parameters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/487099b175c24046d5f624f3e92f02ae8033bb32/app/controllers/jira_connect/events_controller.rb#L37).\n\n## Why is this a ~\"type::bug\" \n\n### Problem:\n\nAtlassian [rolled out new authentication tokens](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/connect-is-returning-to-per-installation-secrets/51059) for some installations, but the [endpoint on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e7181fef8d56d289cf813498ebfc53f70e6d175b/app/controllers/jira_connect/events_controller.rb#L10) was not ready to process the updates.\n\n### Workaround:\n\nReinstalling the app should fix this problem. **WARNING**: Uninstalling the app will remove all GitLab data from the Jira development panel. We are working on a better solution though.\n\n### Upcoming Solution:\n\nWe are able to fix the endpoint for installation updates on GitLab, but waiting to confirm that the authentication token updates can be sent again.\n\n# Note for self-managed users experiencing this issue\n\nThe issue has been fixed on GitLab in %\"14.9\" but it requires an additional to get the app working again:\n\n1.

The problem is that the service does a permissions check, and we have a declarative permission that [explicitly forbids](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/8e4c4cf027bb6f811afe9c6e7dcd86066e09efa7/app/policies/project_policy.rb#L460) the destruction of pipelines on archived projects.\n\nClearly, this is not meant to prevent the destruction of the whole project, or even destruction of pipelines when the context is destruction of the whole project. So we need to go about this somewhat differently.\n\n# Proposed solutions\n\n1.Allow `:destroy_pipeline` on archived Projects. This rule was [written](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/18136) three years ago as part of an effort to make archived, read-only projects untouchable. **Currently being implemented** \n  - We can [do this by not-preventing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344934#note_724284848) unless the Project is **archived and not pending_delete**.\n2. Evade the `Ci::DestroyPipelineService` permissions check:\n\n```diff\nmodule Ci\n  class DestroyPipelineService \u003c BaseService\n    def execute(pipeline)\n-      raise Gitlab::Access::AccessDeniedError unless can?(current_user, :destroy_pipeline, pipeline)\n+      raise Gitlab::Access::AccessDeniedError unless can?(current_user, :destroy_pipeline, pipeline) || pipeline.project.pending_delete? # etc.\n```\n\n3. Un-archive projects at the top of `Projects::DestroyService`. There are [lots](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/8e4c4cf027bb6f811afe9c6e7dcd86066e09efa7/app/policies/concerns/readonly_abilities.rb#L19-40) of \"read-only\" features that we could be potentially leaving behind when we destroy projects, and I believe we're doing this already:\n\n![image](/uploads/1471b45f814aa4891144a0e26fd6be11/image.png)\n\nThis would be a more wide-ranging solution to make sure records get destroyed, but we would need to make sure that we re-archive Projects if they fail to be destroyed in any given attempt.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-04T16:28:45.302Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T21:42:06.447Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T21:42:06.420Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","backend","customer","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","missed:14.5","priority::1","section::ops","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"}],"author":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344934","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344934","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344934/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344934/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344934","relative":"#344934","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344934"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":96746023,"iid":344929,"project_id":278964,"title":"Danger fails to run review roulette on Product Intelligence changes","description":"Possibly since https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72544, Danger doesn't show Product Intelligence review warnings and doesn't run ~\"product intelligence\" review roulette even when PI files are modified.\n\nExample: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72838#note_711013935;

1: Add `/gitlab incident declare` Slack slash command","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nWe can currently open issues from Slack. But, not incidents. We should ensure this action is possible, to better support the incident management workflow. \n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nIntroduce a new Slack slash command for creating incidents. Entering the slash command will trigger a modal where incident details can be added. These added details will be displayed in the incident that's created. So, if a user adds, for instance, a zoom link or a Slack channel at the time of incident creation, these details should display in the `Linked resources` widget. If a label or assignee had been added, those would display in the incident, as well. \n\n| New Slack slash command for creating an incident | Modal for inputting incident details | Example created incident | Success/failure messages |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![New_slash_command](/uploads/1fa60a62ce7a837300587509b61e224f/New_slash_command.png) |![Modal__1_](/uploads/2de38399927e355ae6e865c338ba93c4/Modal__1_.png)|![Auto-populated_incident](/uploads/d33fb9b933d4593b8d922d9d08e2dc32/Auto-populated_incident.png) |  ![failure_messages](/uploads/3ffa81b4178466c3d27cc5f38228654b/failure_messages.png)|\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/yhZmsrVMFJUC390YOKWqUT/Slack-integration-for-incidents-gitlab-com%26364422?node-id=1586%3A38966)\n\nNote: This should be behind the [`:incident_creation_slash_command `](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374971) feature flag.\n\n### Intended Users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager)\n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops)\n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n* [Eddie (Content Editor)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#eddie-content-editor) \n\n--\u003e\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n\n### Technical details\n\n\n\nScope: \n- Trigger modal for incident creation when `/gitlab incident declare` is used\n- Fields in scope: project, title, description, severity, confidential, zoom link\n   - `project` dropdown should contain the list of projects available for the Slack `team_id` of the request. The first project should be selected by default\n   - `severity` dropdown should contain the severity options, with no default selected\n- Ephemeral error message should be presented to the user in slack if we do not create an incident\n- Ephemeral confirmation message should be presented to the user in slack after the incident is created\n- User must have permissions to create incidents\n- ~\"GitLab Core\"+ \n\nOut of scope:\n- In-channel notifications about new incidents is part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369365+\n- [Status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374965)/[Assignees](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374968)/[Labels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374969) fields are a bit more complicated, so they'll be tracked separately\n\nData flow:\n1. User enables the `Slack application` integration on gitlab.com (Settings \u003e Integrations)\n1. User enters `/gitlab incident declare` in any channel in slack\n1. Slack POSTs to `/slack/trigger`, which is configured in our [slack app](https://slack.com/apps/A676ADMV5-gitlab?tab=more_info)\n1. GitLab must return a prompt [acknowledgement response](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#acknowledgment_response)\n1. GitLab POSTs to `response_url` from the previous Slack request. Payload should contain json representing the modal layout.\n1. User fills in details \u0026 submits form. \n1. Slack POSTs to `/slack/trigger` with the payload for the submission.\n1. Respond with an empty [acknowledgement response](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#acknowledgment_response) to close the modal\n1. After creating the incident, GitLab POSTs to `response_url` from the previous Slack request. Payload should contain an ephemeral message, visible to the user who created the incident. The message either confirms successful creation or offers details of the erro.\n\nSupplemental details:\n- Slack dropdowns trigger \"actions\" which will be posted to the same endpoint, so we need to make sure the endpoint returns an [acknowledgement response](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/handling#acknowledgment_response) for those interactions, even if we don't intend to do anything with them. We do _not_ want to return a 404, as too many errors could cause Slack API throttling.\n\n\n### Metrics \n\n\u003c!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature? Think about user behavior and their interaction with the product. What indicates someone is getting value from it?\n\nCreate tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template.

Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-03T19:27:20.991Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T15:43:15.191Z","closed_at":"2022-12-02T04:28:57.856Z","closed_by":{"id":8198564,"username":"rkadam3","name":"Rajendra Kadam","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8198564/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkadam3"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Incident Management","UX","auto updated","closed::complete","devops::monitor","feature::enhancement","group::respond","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","section::ops","severity::4","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":8198564,"username":"rkadam3","name":"Rajendra Kadam","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8198564/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkadam3"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8198564,"username":"rkadam3","name":"Rajendra Kadam","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8198564/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rkadam3"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344856","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":3,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344856","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344856/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344856/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344856","relative":"#344856","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344856"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8805,"epic":{"id":605989,"iid":8805,"title":"Create incidents through Slack","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8805","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96684086,"iid":344854,"project_id":278964,"title":"Fix incorrect naming in code related to cross-references","description":"The following discussion from !72794 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @alexkalderimis started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72794#note_722274935):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e I notice that the signature for this method is defined as:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```ruby\n    \u003e     def create_cross_reference_note(mentioned, noteable, author)\n    \u003e       # implement inside child\n    \u003e     end\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e the mismatch between `noteable` and `mentionable` is a bit confusing.

Create a new `stream_filters` component in `ee/app/assets/javascripts/audit_events/components/stream`:\n   - Note: It should accept the list of `eventTypeFilters`\n   - Note: It should emit a change event with the updated `eventTypeFilters`.\n1. Inside the new component render a [`GlFormCheckboxTree`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/docs/base-form-form-checkbox-tree--default) where the options are the `eventTypeFilters`.\n   - Note: The tree should have the enabled options pre-selected.\n   - Note: For the first iteration the tree should only be 1 level deep, ie no branches / grouped options.\n   - Note: Set `selectAllLabel` \u0026 `unselectAllLabel` to [translated strings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/i18n/externalization.html#javascript-files), else it will always render in english.\n1. Render the new `stream_filters` component in [`stream_destination_editor`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/bb8f98f0995a4ed90599513b62196ac34ac3d8bd/ee/app/assets/javascripts/audit_events/components/stream/stream_destination_editor.vue).\n   - Note: Pass the `eventTypeFilters` from the query to the component.\n   - Note: Listen for change events.\n1. Update the mutation in [`stream_destination_editor`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/bb8f98f0995a4ed90599513b62196ac34ac3d8bd/ee/app/assets/javascripts/audit_events/components/stream/stream_destination_editor.vue) to include the `eventTypeFilters` which should be the picked options. \n1.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-03T12:02:58.945Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T23:47:45.230Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T14:15:04.286Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","devops::verify","feature flag","feature::addition","group::pipeline execution","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344821","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344821","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344821/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344821/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344821","relative":"#344821","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344821"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4840,"epic":{"id":140298,"iid":4840,"title":"Deprecate CI minutes reset jobs in favour of tracking historical usage data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4840","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96653514,"iid":344817,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project namespace members - update REST API","description":"## Problem\nCurrently, we use polymorphic association to load project members in the api endpoints: \n| endpoints            |\n|------------------------------------|\n| /projects/:id/members/:user_id     |\n| /projects/:id/members/all          |\n| /projects/:id/members/all/:user_id |\n| /projects/:id/members              |\n\n\n## Proposal\nUse new direct association through `ProjectNamespace` and `member_namespace_id` to load project members in this endpoints. \n\nConsider feature flagging this change.\n\n## Availability and Testing\n* No new E2E tests or updates needed at this time.

Member-- source ---Namespace\n  Namespace-- Is A ---Group\n```\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6768 a parallel project membership system was established through the `members.member_namespace_id` column and the addition of the `ProjectNamespace` model. Every `Project` is parented by a `ProjectNamespace` model via the `projects.project_namespace_id` column.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  User --- Member\n  Member-- member_namespace_id ---Namespace\n  Namespace-- Is A ---Group\n  Namespace-- Is A ---ProjectNamespace\n  ProjectNamespace-- project_namespace_id ---Project\n```\n\nThis new system aligns our hierarchy so we only have `Namespaces` and not `Namespaces` and `Projects`.\n\nWe now need to replace all membership queries using the old polymorphic `source` system, with the new `member_namespace_id` system.\n\nAll replacements will need to be behind a feature flag.\n\n## To Do\n\nThe goal of the work is to ultimately [remove the polymorphic source relationship](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344816). Therefore, if we remove the relationship in a development environment and run specs we will find parts of the code that fail. Early on we will find components that are shared and common across the code base. As these are patched we will find more independent code paths that are easier to work on concurrently.\n\nIn this issue, start with iterating through that process, with the goal to spin out issues in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8566) that other devs can fix async of that process.\n\n### Availability and Testing\n\n- Since changes will be behind a feature flag, please review the `package-and-qa-ff-enabled` and `package-and-qa-ff-disabled` job results, which should be triggered automatically on the related MRs.

Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-02T17:10:12.862Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T07:21:58.312Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T07:21:58.297Z","closed_by":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"labels":["GitLab Ultimate","Next Up","backend","devops::manage","direction","documentation","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"}],"author":{"id":4376883,"username":"stkerr","name":"Sam Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/591c8b969464f7b4fb97b6f2f654f11a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stkerr"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344668","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344668","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344668/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344668/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344668","relative":"#344668","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344668"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5925,"epic":{"id":263863,"iid":5925,"title":"Streaming Audit Events to user-defined location","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5925","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"needs_attention"}]
