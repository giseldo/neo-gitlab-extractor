[#2952067963](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/-/jobs/2952067963) failed for 4b114518dbace40ccf71012423a2c89fc2c88ec4:\n\nThe jobs for building the application has been failing for [a couple days in a row](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/-/pipelines).\nThe error log from the job will probably help locate the issue:\n```\n\"/builds/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/lib/csv_generator.rb:31:in `csv_data': undefined method `keys' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)\n\tfrom /builds/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/lib/csv_generator.rb:40:in `write_csv'\n\tfrom

/builds/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/lib/builder.rb:7:in `build'\n\tfrom bin/build:5:in `\u003cmain\u003e'\n```\n\nAnother thing that looks suspicious in the log is this part:\n```\n\"Loading next batch [\\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\"]\"\n```\nIt seems like we're not loading any file paths from the GitLabAPI.\n\nHowever, please note that the empty file paths kind of logs seems to also be in jobs that end successfully: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/-/jobs/2938583638 [it might be caused by another bug].\n\n## Work-around\n\nTo view the current status of a metric, please refer to the in code:\n- [metrics definition YAML files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/metrics) \n- and under ee [metrics definition YAML files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/config/metrics)\n\n## Affects Product Data\n\nPlease be aware that this issue does not affect the validity of product data. However, the metrics reported are stale which means that some newly instrumented metrics may not appear and some deprecated metrics may appear to be erroneously active. Some of the older metrics can also be missing on the page.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-30T08:11:32.317Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T08:30:01.215Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T08:26:50.965Z","closed_by":{"id":1863977,"username":"michold","name":"Micha≈Ç

happen if this goes wrong?\n\nProjects scheduled for a deletion are not deleted.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n* https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/6a755f20-2dde-11ed-8656-f5f2137823ba (Production)\n* https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/b60139f0-2e92-11ed-b86b-d963a1a6788e (Production successful removal)\n* https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net/goto/b636fcc0-2dde-11ed-af31-918941b0065a (Staging)\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set extract_mr_diff_deletions true --dev --staging --staging-ref`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to.

This way, you can add environment-specific values to the agent configuration file and keep generic values within the Helm chart.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nIt should be possible to set the values for a Helm release directly from the agent configuration file.\n\n### Background\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/merge_requests/727#note_1078812703.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSupport inline value objects, under `values.inline` for a given release. For example:\n\n```yaml\ngitops:\n  charts:\n  - release_name: my-release\n    source:\n      project:\n        id: my-group/my-charts\n        path: charts/the-chart\n    values:\n      - inline:\n          tag: v15.5.1\n          rbac:\n            create: true\n```\n\nWhen `values.inline` is set, this should be deep-merged on top of (overwrite) the values from the chart.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-27T00:35:13.446Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T12:05:12.561Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T09:00:35.007Z","closed_by":{"id":4545061,"username":"nagyv-gitlab","name":"Viktor Nagy (GitLab)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb255c1e9c228b9356af165939b3ac9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nagyv-gitlab"},"labels":["Category:Kubernetes Management","Deliverable","GitLab Free","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","devops::configure","documentation","feature::addition","group::configure","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":4088036,"username":"hfyngvason","name":"Hordur Freyr Yngvason","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4088036/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason"}],"author":{"id":4855585,"username":"ash2k","name":"Mikhail Mazurskiy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3161684bd29f5016064a6c16ccd3bc7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ash2k"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4088036,"username":"hfyngvason","name":"Hordur Freyr Yngvason","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4088036/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hfyngvason"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372024","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372024","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372024/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/372024/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#372024","relative":"#372024","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#372024"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7938,"epic":{"id":507942,"iid":7938,"title":"Support of templating tools (kustomize, kpt, helm)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7938","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113942602,"iid":372022,"project_id":278964,"title":"Change the text Elasticsearch to OpenSearch in Advanced Search Admin UI for AWS hosted search service","description":"In the Advanced Search configuration part in Admin UI, we still use text Elasticsearch for AWS hosted search service.

\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8433, we're moving to GraphQL for rendering Environment Index/Details page and moving away from the internal Controller API. This issue is to extend the [GraphQL API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/) to let frontend fetch folderized environments, something similar to `environments.json` does in [Environment Index page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/environments).\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Add a new argument `environment_type` to the `EnvironmentsResolver` for fetching environments in a specific folder.\n  - This can be used in an expanded folder in Environment Index page.\n  - This can be used in Environment Index page in a specific folder e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/environments/folders/review.\n- Add a new field `nested_environments` to `ProjectType` for fetching nested environments.\n  - Add `NestedEnvironmentsResolver` to find environments with nesting. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/serializers/environment_serializer.rb#L36-39 about the nesting logic.\n  - Add `NestedEnvironmentType` with the following fields:\n    - `size` ... How many environments exist in the nest.\n    - `environment` ... The environment represents the group. `Types::EnvironmentType` should be used.\n  - This can be used in Environment Index page e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/environments. See `environments.json` for more information.\n\nA few notes:\n\n- `EnvironmentsFinder` already supports `type` param. We should be able to use it as-is.\n- For `environments.json`, we folderize this in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/serializers/environment_serializer.rb#L20.\n\n### Query example\n\n```\n{\n  project(fullPath: \"dosuken-org/deployment-approval-test\") {\n    nested_environments(state: AVAILABLE, search: \"\") {\n      nodes {\n        size\n        environment {\n          name\n          environment_type\n          last_deployment {\n            ...\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Concerns\n\n- `nested_environments` could be an expensive process due to the complex grouping query. Given that we're reusing the existing logic, it might be fine, however, we should seek a way to simplify the logic.\n\n## environments.json example\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\n```\n    {\n

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen a project has a lot of deployed environments, opening multiple tabs on the `Deployments -\u003e Environments` page \nfor that project results in correspondingly exponential increases in Server CPU resource usage.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAt this stage, we could only reproduce this on the customer's Omnibus single node environment:\n\n1. Have a project with 6 Environments folders and 5 environments. (Group1 -\u003e ProjectA)\n2. Open Project1 and go to `Deployments -\u003e Environments`\n3. Monitor CPU usage on server\n3. Open around 6 tabs on that page\n4. Notice CPU usage increase\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOpening 6 browser tabs or more on that page results in increasing CPU usage.\nTo the point where the vast majority of CPU time is continuously being used to serve these pages.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nShould not use that much CPU time.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nAnnotated CPU resource usage graph:\n\n![CPU_30mins_annotated](/uploads/607a74510d67bdc9667f564885f40bf6/CPU_30mins_annotated.png)\n\n\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\nSystem information\nSystem:         Ubuntu 20.04\nProxy:          no\nCurrent User:   git\nUsing RVM:      no\nRuby Version:   2.7.5p203\nGem Version:    3.1.4\nBundler Version:2.2.33\nRake Version:   13.0.6\nRedis Version:  6.2.6\nSidekiq Version:6.4.0\nGo Version:     unknown\n\nGitLab information\nVersion:        14.10.5-ee\nRevision:       af6735ad95f\nDirectory:      /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails\nDB Adapter:     PostgreSQL\nDB Version:     13.4\nURL:            https://gitlab.\u003cREDACTED\u003e.au\nHTTP Clone URL: https://gitlab.\u003cREDACTED\u003e.au/some-group/some-project.git\nSSH Clone URL:  git@ssh.gitlab.\u003cREDACTED\u003e.au:some-group/some-project.git\nElasticsearch:  no\nGeo:            no\nUsing LDAP:     no\nUsing Omniauth: yes\nOmniauth Providers: saml\n\nGitLab Shell\nVersion:        13.25.1\nRepository storage paths:\n- default:      /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories\nGitLab Shell path:              /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nChecking GitLab subtasks ...\n\nChecking GitLab Shell ...\n\nGitLab Shell: ...

The environment index API query (i.e. `environments.json`) that queries every environment for this project then nests them by folder, removing the details for the nested environments [during presentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/013bbd9e83af3aa69818b988472152ba270d79ce/app/serializers/environment_serializer.rb#L20-20)\n2. The environment folder API query (i.e. `environments/folders/FOLDERNAME`) that does the same query as above again, this time for this specific folder.\n\nThe problem here is the same information is being queried multiple times\n1. The backend is not presenting all the environments inside folders even though they have been queried from the database\n2. The frontend is not passing this information between `EnvironmentsApp` and `EnvironmentFolder` Vue components, instead `EnvironmentFolder` has it's own background thread querying it's information _one per folder_\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n1. Consolidate all nested environment queries into the main environment index call, passing the data from `EnvironmentsApp` down to the child components\n2. Convert environment index query to a GraphQL subscription to convert this to a push relationship, removing the polling that is so taxing on the server\n\nNumber 1 is going to be necessary to alleviate the issue, number 2 would help even further\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem.

GitLab user when PAT is auto-revoked","description":"### Proposal\n\nWhen using the [Personal Access Token API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/personal_access_tokens.html), revocation happens silently. We should update the flow to send an email notification to users in the event that a token is revoked.\n\n#### Implementation steps\n\n1. Add new Rails [mailer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/app/mailers) notifying user of PAT token revocation\n2. Add logic triggering mailer during [revocation flows](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/personal_access_tokens/revoke_service.rb)\n3. Add tests covering mailer triggering behavior\n4. Consider adding handling for [additional attribution](#additional-attribution) based on revoking entity\n\n#### Text copy\n\nWe could use generic copy initially but to better support https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371658 it would be helpful to include attribution when possible distinguishing \"we revoked the token because it was public\" from a more generic \"the token was revoked\" copy.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371911#note_1078507833\n\n#### Additional attribution\n\nWhen the Revocation API endpoint(s) receive an additional param, the token is validated. If confirmed, the notification will include additional copy notifying the user the token was auto-revoked.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371911#note_1079583037 for possible

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361732) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set update_legacy_slack_installations \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set update_legacy_slack_installations \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set update_legacy_slack_installations true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361732) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `update_legacy_slack_installations` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361732) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete update_legacy_slack_installations --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set update_legacy_slack_installations false\n```\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nSuggestions: \n* Roll out first on staging, and monitor staging test results in Slack\n* After rolling out on production, monitor production test results in Slack\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

This could happen given the following config:\n\n```yml\ntest:\n  script:\n    - do_test\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      junit: rspec.xml\n\n    # note there is no `paths:`\n```\n\nOn the other hand, a similar pipeline with an archive artifact defined as follows would have all the artifacts from earlier pipelines unlocked:\n\n```yml\ntest:\n  script:\n    - do_test\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - rspec.xml\n    reports:\n      junit: rspec.xml\n```\n\nIf the suspected behaviour indeed happens, we have an inconsistent behaviour where non-archive job artifact types may never be unlocked. Consequently, these job artifacts will never be erased after the `expire_at` date.\n\n### What needs to be done?\n\n- [x] Verify if this is indeed the case for pipeline that has no archive type job artifacts\n- [x] Decide if this guard clause should be removed\n- [ ] Fix the code\n\n### Proposal\n\nReplace the guard clause in [`Ci::PipelineSuccessUnlockWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/workers/ci/pipeline_success_unlock_artifacts_worker.rb#L16-16) to check if the pipeline (i.e latest successful pipeline) has erasable artifacts.\n\nThis will have 2 possible effects:\n1. If the latest successful pipeline has erasable artifacts, it will unlock all the job artifacts of the previous pipelines\n1. If the latest successful pipeline does not have erasable artifacts, it will not unlock the previous pipeline's job artifacts.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. Given a new pipeline that only has a report artifact (not archive) and one previous pipeline that have locked report job artifacts, when the new pipeline succeeds, the **previous pipeline's job artifacts are unlocked**.\n1. Given a new pipeline that only has a report artifact (not archive) and _multiple_ previous pipelines that have locked report job artifacts, when the new pipeline succeeds, **all the previous pipelines' job artifacts are unlocked**.\n1. Given a new pipeline that does not have any job artifact and one previous pipeline that have locked report job artifacts, when the new pipeline succeeds, the **previous pipeline's job artifacts remain unlocked**.\n\nCaveats:\n\n- Given a new pipeline that does not have any job artifact and _multiple_ previous pipeline that have locked report job artifacts, when the new pipeline succeeds, the **previous pipeline's job artifacts will remain locked**.

Instead, we'll need to QA on staging and then enable on production.\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nImmediately.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe API endpoint `/api/v4/integrations/slack/events` might error. This endpoint is only used by the Slack Events API.\n\nThe GitLab Slack App's Home tab will not display our intended view, although the customer will not see any errors. Just a place-holder view provided by Slack.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nSentry for errors.\n\nKibana to see the worker.\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\nSentry for errors.\n\nKibana to see the worker.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set slack_events_app_home_opened true --dev --staging --staging-ref`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\nThe feature flag does not take an actor so there is no rollout.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363635) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set slack_events_app_home_opened \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set slack_events_app_home_opened \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set slack_events_app_home_opened true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363635) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `slack_events_app_home_opened` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363635) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] If not already done, clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete slack_events_app_home_opened --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set slack_events_app_home_opened false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-23T23:59:35.079Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T18:28:42.839Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T04:59:17.620Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke

step log entries have too many fields","description":"\u003c!--\nTriage of infradev Issues is desired to occur asynchronously.\nFor maximum efficiency, please ensure the following, so that your infradev issues can gain maximum traction.\n\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#a-guide-to-creating-effective-infradev-issues\n--\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\u003c!--\nClearly state the scope of the problem, and how it affects GitLab.com\n--\u003e\n\nWhen producing log entries, we need to be weary of dynamically defined fields, as they can explode the log schema cardinality, creating too many fields in Elasticsearch. Because the schema size can have a negative impact on Elasticsearch performance and stability, it caps the maximum number of fields to 1024.\n\nOnce this limit is reached, entries attempting to add more fields may be rejected. If the combined cardinality of indices involved in a search exceeds 1024, the search may fail.\n\nSee also:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/10173\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31910\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32583\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/32859\n\n## Impact\n\u003c!--\n- Quantify the effect of the problem to help ensure that correct prioritization occurs.\n- Include costs to availability. The Incident Budget Explorer dashboard can help here.\n- Include the number of times alerts have fired owing to the problem, how much time was spent dealing with the problem, and how many people were involved.\n- Link to affected incidents, and cross-reference them as related issues.\n- Include screenshots of visualization from Grafana or Kibana.\n- Always include a permalink to the source of the screenshot so that others can investigate further.\n--\u003e\n\nQuality and availability of logs is impacted, which makes it harder for infrastructure to sustainably maintain availability for GitLab.com.\n\nHere is an example of a failed search:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"shard\": 0,\n    \"index\": \"pubsub-rails-inf-gprd-012926\",\n    \"node\": \"g2aX_u-BSg6-cx1U09F19Q\",\n    \"reason\": {\n        \"type\": \"query_shard_exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"failed to create query: field expansion matches too many fields, limit: 1024, got: 1181\",\n        \"index_uuid\": \"dXd8P6NJSIuyrYC0R4OB1g\",\n        \"index\": \"pubsub-rails-inf-gprd-012926\",\n        \"caused_by\": {\n        \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"field expansion matches too many fields, limit: 1024, got: 1181\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n![Screenshot_2022-08-23_at_16.54.37](/uploads/0b5e21e19e6991b17cc3ea25ca175c91/Screenshot_2022-08-23_at_16.54.37.png)\n\n![Screenshot_2022-08-23_at_16.44.33](/uploads/76b1a8a6bdabbc2ce786709455570732/Screenshot_2022-08-23_at_16.44.33.png)\n\n[source](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/297a8a00-22f2-11ed-8656-f5f2137823ba)\n\n## Recommendation\n\u003c!--\nProvide a clear, unambiguous, self-contained solution to the problem.\n--\u003e\n\nI ran some analysis on the current mappings:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -s $ELASTICSEARCH_URL/pubsub-rails-inf-gprd-\\*/_mappings \u003e mappings.rails.json\n$ cat mappings.rails.json | jq -r '.[].mappings|paths|join(\";\")|[., 1]|@tsv' | sd -s ';properties;' ';' | grep ';type' | sd '_' ';' | flamegraph.pl --hash \u003e flamegraph.svg\n```\n\n[mappings.rails.json](/uploads/002d19eb0fb1979d4aef3b55989408db/mappings.rails.json)\n\n![flamegraph.svg](/uploads/77cebe90ba74a857a55c712f4909c768/flamegraph.svg)\n\nWe can see two clusters:\n\n- `pipeline_`: Almost 20% of the total schema size. This includes fields like `pipeline_step_gitlab_ci_pipeline_chain_build_associations_duration_s`.\n- `config_`: Around 7% of the total schema size. This includes fields like `config_build_context_duration_s`.\n\nWhile these granular breakdowns can be very useful for analysis, they are too fine-grained for what Elasticsearch can handle.\n\nThus, we should either make these a little more coarse-grained (to reduce the number of fields), or convert them to a single array field containing key-value pairs.\n\n## Verification\n\u003c!--\nProvide a method for validating that the original issue still exists.\n\nHaving a way of checking validity can save on a great deal of back-and-forth discussion between Infradev Triage participants including Engineering Managers, Directors and Product Managers and make space for other non-resolved issues to get scheduled sooner.\n\nIdeally, provide a link to a Thanos query or an ELK query and clear instructions on how to interpret the results to determine whether the problem is still occurring.\n--\u003e\n\n[This kibana search](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/297a8a00-22f2-11ed-8656-f5f2137823ba) should no longer produce an error.\n\nIt's also possible to look at the number of fields in the rails schema:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -s \"$ELASTICSEARCH_URL/$(curl -s $ELASTICSEARCH_URL/pubsub-rails-inf-gprd/_alias | jq -r 'to_entries[]|select(.value.aliases[].is_write_index)|.key')/_mappings\" | jq -r '.[]|paths|join(\".\")' | sd -s '.properties.' '.' | grep '\\.type$' | wc -l\n\n    1189\n```\n\nThis number should be significantly below 1024.\n\n## Workaround\n\nThis error occurs when searching all fields (via the search field at the top). By matching on specific columns, you can still get responses.\n\n\u003c!--\nWorkflow and other relevant labels\n\nSee also:\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#availability\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/stages.yml\n--\u003e\n\n## Technical Proposal\n\nThere are simple modifications we can do, while we wait for #373143, to reduce the number of fields:\n\n- [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/103165 - Remove any fields we think are not needed or show data that is not relevant to the performance problem - \n- [ ] In https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/5bb29a20-6038-11ed-b0ec-930003e0679c we can clearly see the big hitters from `pipeline_step_gitlab_ci_pipeline_chain_*`. We can consider logging only the top 10 (instead of 33 today).\n- [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/104593 - Each `pipeline_step_gitlab_ci_pipeline_chain_*_duration_s` contains `.avg`, `.count`, `.max`, `.min`, `.sum` but we only measure it once. See `.count = 1` always. This means we could just have `pipeline_step_gitlab_ci_pipeline_chain_*_duration_s` containing the duration measured once (equivalent of `.sum`). And we could reduce these attributes x5.\n    - For example: introduce `observe_once` method.\n- [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/104580 - For the other more granular observations we could only log `.count` and `.sum` (`.avg` can be derived from those, `.min` and `.max` may not be as critical for now).\n\nWith this we may be able to have a 70-80% reduction in attributes, while still maintaining the data we need to investigate https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7290+\n\n## How to track improvements\n\n```ruby\n# dump the content of a document from Kibana\n# query: json.class: \"Gitlab::Ci::Pipeline::Logger\" AND NOT json.pipeline_source: \"unknown\"\njson = JSON.parse(File.read('document.json'))\n\n# fields introduced by the default json logger. We won't touch these.\ndefault_fields = 25\n\n# count the number of fields exported. Not all the fields are added by the pipeline logger\n# but we can use this number as the initial value before reducing the fields.\njson['fields'].select { |f| f.start_with?('json.') }.count - default_fields\n# =\u003e 390\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-23T15:13:35.410Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T12:04:59.414Z","closed_at":"2022-11-28T16:19:18.721Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio

CI Pipeline via a Trigger Token, the serialized [JSON payload that is sent within the `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/#use-a-webhook-payload) is improperly serialized which

specifically problems arise at the first mention of redacted email `\\\"email\\\":\\\"\":{\"REDACTED\":{\"\\\"}` (there are two email references).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\nThe following steps will most likely need to be performed by a non-administrator and specifically on SaaS as the \"Redacted\" might be specific to SaaS.\n\n1. Create a simple project like [this](https://staging.gitlab.com/hiftikhar/issue-371609) to output the `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD` data when the CI runs.\n2. Generate a Trigger Token in a project: `Project` \u003e `Settings` \u003e `CI/CD` \u003e `Pipeline triggers` \u003e `Add trigger` (trigger tokens will, unlike any other token to trigger a pipeline, expose the Trigger Payload Data to project owners within the GitLab UI when viewing the job). \n3. Create a Webhook and pass the generated trigger from step 1: `Project` \u003e `Settings` \u003e `Webhooks` where URL is `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/ref/REF_NAME/trigger/pipeline?token=TOKEN` (replacing the all-caps values with appropriate variables). Example: `https://staging.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7947124/ref/main/trigger/pipeline?token=glptt-b5e28a98cf4bc54f3331985c160d6a0fdb1e6791`\n4. Test the webhook and click on \"Merge requests events\" \n\u003ckbd\u003e![image](/uploads/e7939e3a2cc1f6704be720e146947157/image.png)\u003c/kbd\u003e\n5. Check the [recent events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#troubleshoot-webhooks) of that webhook and see that the payload is a valid JSON payload.\n6. Now add an [external status check](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/status_checks.html) for this project by going to `Project Settings \u003e General \u003e Merge requests`.\n7. Add status check and put the same trigger URL as the URL in \"API to check\".\n8. Create an MR in this project so that the external status check we created above is triggered.\n9. Check the output of the pipeline that was triggered because of the external status check. The `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD` data is not correctly escaped and is not a valid JSON payload. Example job - https://staging.gitlab.com/hiftikhar/issue-371609/-/jobs/43509743\n\n\n| Valid JSON payload | Invalid JSON payload |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/04ca82661a065d66c122609bcb3e736b/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/abb0a4c53b434d2728c944c796323088/image.png) |\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nPython Project - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/tpoffenbarger/dart/-/jobs/2917587532#L158\n\nRuby Project - https://staging.gitlab.com/hiftikhar/issue-371609\n\nPlease note that the Trigger Token that is mentioned in

synced on SFDC.\n\n## Background\n\nThis is because we use CustomersDot's `Order#subsciption_id` to sync data to Zuora, but SFDC may be using referencing a later subscription version's id. If the two do not match, then SFDC will not be synced.\n\n(Usually SFDC should be mapped to the most current version of the Subscription, but if we had encountered a sync error, then SFDC may map to an earlier subscription ID.)\n\nFor example, on CustomersDot there is a `Order#subsciption_id` which is 2c92a09a720cc47801721caf4c4e7ab1. It's synced on Zuora. SFDC subscription is referencing the latest subscription ID 2c92a00e720cc40301722d09cf503d69.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe backfilling script, when updating a subscription version, will need to also update other versions under the same subscription name.

At the moment, for every one of those registry records, we enqueue a `Geo::FileRegistryRemovalWorker`. This is a lot of overhead.\n\nFor example, on an existing Geo deployment, disable `sync_object_storage` for a secondary Geo site. If that site has 1M blobs in object storage, then `RegistryConsistencyWorker` will enqueue at least 1M removal jobs.\n\nFurthermore, I think since the worker is not declared idempotent at the moment, this will cause runaway queue growth, if `RegistryConsistencyWorker` can enqueue jobs faster than they can be processed (seems likely).\n\n## Proposal\n\nFirst iteration: Declare `Geo::FileRegistryRemovalWorker` idempotent, to take advantage of job deduplication and avoid excessive queue growth. Add idempotence tests as mentioned in GitLab Sidekiq docs.\n\nI think we haven't heard much of this problem, so I think that's relatively ok to leave there for now.\n\nBut here is a follow up idea: Rewrite [def self.delete_for_model_ids(ids)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/569e2476b4f61960a425a276e226381b75b753d4/ee/app/models/geo/base_registry.rb#L39) (and its friends) to do a single query against the main database, and a single query against the registry, compare it in Ruby (don't do a cross-database query), and do a bulk delete if we actually don't want to delete files. For the records where we do want to delete the files, those should be handled as they are now-- enqueue a removal job for each.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-23T01:47:10.915Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T19:14:02.791Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T19:13:59.883Z","closed_by":{"id":11488451,"username":"juan-silva","name":"Juan Silva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11488451/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/juan-silva"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","bug::performance","devops::systems","group::geo","priority::4","section::enablement","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371577","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371577","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371577/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371577/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371577","relative":"#371577","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371577"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113660091,"iid":371571,"project_id":278964,"title":"Geo LFS redirect from secondary to primary may not work mid-session","description":"This is a summary of what we believe may be happening in https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/318550:\n\n1.

Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org,gitlab-com ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Consider cleaning up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel. Otherwise these settings may override the default enabled.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable --dev --staging --staging-ref --production`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_variables_refactoring_to_variable`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance.

But to be efficient in queries Finder must know which fields and\\or ordering is required for Reducer and which is not. Then we can select only those fields which are required and by that improving performance of heavy queries.\n\nSo here I suggest to following steps:\n1. Make \"Executor\" work with config file. Move all defaults and config handling to \"Executor\".\n2. Create finder and reducer objects based on Executor. \n2.

This is useful when doing ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) estimation before an epic is decomposed into smaller vertical slices and estimated by a development team. \n1.

When sync object storage is disabled, we return only LFS object whether the file is stored locally, and this relation will not include the new LFS object that is on object storage. So, the Geo::RegistryConsistenceService triggers the deletion.\n\n### Workaround\n\nUse GitLab managed object replication\n\n### Root cause\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95937#note_1073517003:\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nThe customer is experiencing the bug described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371397 while importing Bitbucket projects. This happens because during the LFS objects import phase we:\n\n1. Download the file into a temporary folder\n1. Create an entry in the `lfs_objects` table with `file_store = 1`\n1. Move the file to the object store\n1. Update the `file_store` column\n\nSince `LfsObject.replicables_for_current_seconndary` return only LFS objects whether the file is stored locally (`file_store = 1`) when the GitLab managed-replication is disabled, this relation will include the LFS object created in step 2 above and the `Geo::RegistryConsistenceWorker` will create a registry in the tracking database. The next time `Geo::RegistryConsistenceWorker` runs, it removes the registry rows improperly created due to the workflow described above. We can validate this locally following steps 1-11 in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95937#how-to-set-up-and-validate-locally, then:\n\n1. In a Rails console session on your primary site, create an LFS object:\n\n   ```ruby\n   \u003e LfsObject.safe_find_or_create_by!(oid: 'f2b0a1e7550e9b718dafc9b525a04879a766de62e4fbdfc46593d47f7ab74642', size: 10.kilobytes)\n   =\u003e #\u003cLfsObject:0x00000001186819b0\n   id: 6,\n   oid: \"f2b0a1e7550e9b718dafc9b525a04879a766de62e4fbdfc46593d47f7ab74642\",\n   size: 51200,\n   created_at: Mon, 22 Aug 2022 23:32:13.297947000 UTC +00:00,\n   updated_at: Mon, 22 Aug 2022 23:32:13.297947000 UTC +00:00,\n   file: \"a1e7550e9b718dafc9b525a04879a766de62e4fbdfc46593d47f7ab74642\",\n   file_store: 1,\n   verification_checksum: nil\u003e\n   ```\n\n1. In a Rails console session on your secondary site, check the latest `Geo::LfsObjectRegistry` record:\n\n```ruby\n \u003e Geo::LfsObjectRegistry.last\n =\u003e #\u003cGeo::LfsObjectRegistry:0x0000000130853000\n  id: 6,\n  created_at: Mon, 22 Aug 2022 23:32:16.167890000 UTC +00:00,\n  retry_at: Mon, 22 Aug 2022 23:33:01.291105000 UTC +00:00,\n  bytes: nil,\n  lfs_object_id: 6,\n  retry_count: 1,\n  missing_on_primary: false,\n  success: false,\n  sha256: nil,\n  state: 3,\n  last_synced_at: Mon, 22 Aug 2022 23:32:16.166723000 UTC +00:00,\n  last_sync_failure: \"The file is missing on the Geo primary site\",\n  verification_started_at: nil,\n  verified_at: nil,\n  verification_retry_at: nil,\n  verification_retry_count: 0,\n  verification_state: 0,\n  checksum_mismatch: false,\n  verification_checksum: nil,\n  verification_checksum_mismatched: nil,\n  verification_failure: nil\u003e\n```\n\nThat's why we also have the same check introduced in this MR in the [GitLab::Geo::Replication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/gitlab/geo/replication/blob_downloader.rb#L96-98) to avoid downloading unnecessary LFS objects.\n\nIf someone wants to go deeper into the current implementation, follow the method calls called in the workflow above:\n\n1. `Projects::ImportService#execute`\n1. `Projects::ImportService#download_lfs_objects`\n1. `Projects::LfsPointers::LfsImportService.new(project).execute`\n1. `Projects::LfsDownloadService.new(project, lfs_download_object).execute`\n1. `Projects::LfsDownloadService.find_or_create_lfs_object`\n1. `LfsObject.safe_find_or_create_by!(oid: lfs_oid, size: lfs_size)`\n1. `lfs_obj.update!(file: tmp_file) unless lfs_obj.file.file`\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\nThe bug was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/80007 and only affects the following scenarios on GitLab instances running version =\u003e 15.0.\n\n1. LFS objects created while importing a project with object storage enabled and the GitLab managed replication disabled due to how we import those files.\n1. If a customer is using the GitLab-managed replication to sync object storage, then disables it. The next time `Geo::RegistryConsistenceWorker` runs, it removes the registry rows and the file on object storage.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-19T16:27:55.008Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T18:10:44.911Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T20:26:27.748Z","closed_by":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"labels":["customer","devops::systems","group::geo","priority::1","section::enablement","severity::1","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"}],"author":{"id":40631,"username":"dstanley","name":"Diana Stanley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40631/pink.JPG","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dstanley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":283999,"username":"dbalexandre","name":"Douglas Barbosa Alexandre","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/283999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dbalexandre"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371397","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371397","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371397/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/371397/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#371397","relative":"#371397","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#371397"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":113537929,"iid":371396,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add prefix to pipeline trigger tokens to make them easier to scan for an detect leaks","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nLike many of our peers in the industry we've been adding prefixes to some of our tokens (personal/project/group access tokens, runner registration tokens).
