optional includes in GitLab CI configurations","description":"\n\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nIf Project A includes a CI File from Project B which has an conditional include, the include is not evaluated against Project A but Project B.\n\nAlthough expectation is, that the include exists is evaluated against Project A - to allow more general porpuse and self managed includes without additional setup logic.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Add a new key to include `optional` to `include` statements which changes the behaviour from: \n  * Causing an error when the file doesn't exist.\n  * Doing nothing when the file doesn't exist. Specifically, **not including the file in question.**\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n  project: \"x\"\n  file: \"y\"\n  ref: \"z\"\n  optional: boolean\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nBasic Setup:\n\n- Project A .gitlab-ci.yml\n```yaml\n# project A\nincludes:\n  - remote: ProjectB\n    file: include.yml\n\n```\n\n- Project B include.yml\n```yaml\nincludes:\n  - local: sub-include.yml\n    rules:\n      - exists:\n        - \"Dockerfile\"\n```\n\n- Project B sub-include.yml\n```\n# actually not relevant\njob:\n  script: echo \"test\"\n```\n\nReproduce 1#:\n1. create a Dockerfile within Project A:\n2. run the pipleine of Project A\n3. expectation is that `job` will run, but does not\n\nReproduce 2#:\n1. create a Dockerfile within Project B\n1. remove the Dockerfile from Project A\n1. run the pipeline of Project A\n1. expectation is that `job` will run, and it does, although there is no Dockerfile within the project which is triggering the CI pipeline\n\n### Example Project\n\nProject with the includes: https://gitlab.com/lazy-lint/my-project\n\nProject using the includes: https://gitlab.com/lazy-lint/testing/bigtestproject\n\n- should run a HadoLint step and a Go step and a CSS step, based on the files, but does not do so\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nConditional includes for file existence are evaluated in the context of the project we are including the file from, if the condition is defined within that project.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nConditional includes for file existence should be evaluated against the files of the project which is including the files even if those are sub includes from a different project.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n![image](/uploads/40f48d04aff5aea1072ad95d36f52ce2/image.png)\n\nAs you can see the jobs are created based on the file existence in the Project i am included the file from, instead of the project where the pipeline is started.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Additional links\n\n- see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341511#note_782819207 for the initial

A possible solution would be to add breakpoint classes to reduce the size of the text field.\n\n## Accessing the form\n\n1. Ensure you have an EE license, or stub the `cycle_analytics_for_groups` license feature to true\n1. Create a group\n1. Create a project within a group (make sure to initialize the project with a readme, or create it from a template)\n1. Seed some test VSA data\n\n   ```shell\n   $ VSA_SEED_PROJECT_ID=\u003cproject-id\u003e VSA_ISSUE_COUNT=10 SEED_VSA=true FILTER=cycle_analytics rake db:seed_fu\n   ```\n1. Navigate to value stream analytics for the group, ie for a project named clean-vsa-project in group new-vsa-group it would be http://`\u003cgdk\u003e`/group/:group_id/-/analytics/value_stream_analytics (or find it in the left menu)\n1.

endpoint","description":"This issue is to rollout [Enforce rate limit per IP on /users/:username/exists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77119) on production, that is currently behind the `rate_limit_username_exists_endpoint` feature flag.\n\nThis introduces rate limiting for the internal API endpoint `/users/:username/exists`, in order to mitigate the risk of misuses, such as mass-discovery of usernames in use, as part of the solution of [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29040)\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: group::optimize\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_manage_optimize`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @m_frankiewicz\n- PM: @hdelalic \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n  - The Security Team\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe internal API endpoint `/users/:username/exists`, used by the registration to perform a client-side validation for uniqueness of the chosen username, will be rate-limited to maximum 20 calls per minute per IP address.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf the rate limit turns out to be too stringent, it is possible that some legitimate user is being limited in how frequently they can call this API endpoint. In that case, the feature should be turned off, and a higher limit should be applied, after agreeing with security on what is appropriate.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nAn increase of 429 response statuses on calls to `/users/:username/exists` could indicate either an attempt to misuse the endpoint that is correctly stopped by this feature, or possibly a legitimate user that is hitting the limit.\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\nProduction logs for 429 response statuses on calls to `/users/:username/exists`. A high number of those would indicate that we are possibly limiting too many users.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).  MR with documentation changes: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78548.\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```\n\n## Availability and Testing\nFor more details, see the following [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349132#note_820205301)\n- Tests at the controller level exist for testing the rate limit of this specific endpoint.\n- An issue is currently opened for extending QA tests for rate limits in general: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350898\n- Rollout and rollback steps concerning availability are already outlined in description above.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-20T17:07:13.097Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:07:12.155Z","closed_at":"2022-03-16T11:07:12.137Z","closed_by":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"labels":["backend","devops::manage","feature flag","feature::addition","group::optimize","quad-planning::complete-action","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348974","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":31},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"31 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348974","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348974/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348974/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348974","relative":"#348974","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348974"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":99491360,"iid":348968,"project_id":278964,"title":"Prevent incorrect usage of `tracking_attrs` helper","description":"[`tracking_attrs`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/implementation.html#helper-methods) can silently override or be overridden by other data attributes declared in the same element.\n\n- Update docs example.\n- Determine if we can find a way to merge these data attributes, regardless of their definition order.\n- Determine if we want to deprecate/remove this helper.

The validation happens using a `HTTP HEAD` request to the given URL to validate the `content-length` and `content-type` headers of the file. \n\nBut, Amazon S3 presigned URLs only respond to one HTTP verb, by default `GET`, which always returns the full file in the response. To avoid _downloading_ big files to validate them, for now when the import comes from Amazon S3 presigned URLs we're skipping the validation in the early stages of the import https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75170#note_748059103.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nCreate a new endpoint like `POST /projects/aws-s3-import` where the user can pass S3 specific information required to retrive the file:\n1. access_key_id\n1. secret_access_key\n1. bucket_name\n1. file_key\n\nThen, using the AWS-S3 gem (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby), which is already in GitLab, we could validate the file and create the URL to be saved in the database. Something like:\n\n```ruby\ns3_client = Aws::S3::Client.new(access_key_id: params[:access_key_id], secret_access_key: params[:secret_access_key])\nfile = Aws::S3::Object.new(params[:bucket_name], params[:file_key], client: s3_client)\nfile.content_length # =\u003e retrieves the file size\nfile.content_type   # =\u003e retrieves the file type\nfile.presigned_url(:get, expires_in: 2.days.seconds.to_i) # =\u003e creates the presigned URL to be saved and used to do the import\n```\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e original discussion \u003c/summary\u003e\nThe following discussion from !75170 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @reprazent started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75170#note_748059103):  (+11 comments)\n\n    \u003e Wouldn't changing this result in the body of the response containing the entire archive?

the entire row of Level 1 MR Report Widgets clickable","description":"# Problem\n\nOn a weekly call of the Working Group, @timzallmann proposed having the entire row of the report widget clickable to assist in expanding/collapsing the other levels.\n\nThis is supported by Fitts Law that mentions that:\n\u003e the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the target's size, the longer it takes.\nin https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/fitts-law\n\nSo the size of the chevron button being small (which is good for less cluttering the UI if not the focus of the user) could start being an annoyance to users. (theory)\n\n# Proposal\n\nThis area might have more than one call to action, however, defaulting the click in the \"whitespace\" of the row to expanding/collapsing is a fair assessment given that that's the one thing common in all widgets, regardless of having more than one CTA or not.\n\nAn important aspect is implementing this in a way that the feedback is provided accordingly: the hover/focus state for the expanded chevron should be activated as well.\n\nAs seen in the video

of `rate_limit_user_by_id_endpoint`","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [Add rate limiting to users get by id endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73069) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `rate_limit_user_by_id_endpoint` feature flag.\n\nUpdate: When we rolled out the [rate limiting of ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73069)`/users/:id` API, on staging some specs have [started to fail](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6162) with `429 Too Many Requests` status.\n\nTherefore in [Make rate limiting of /users/:id configurable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78364) we changed to use a bigger limit and longer interval (300 per 10 minutes instead of 10 per minute) and also made the limit configurable, so that it can be set differently on staging.\n\nThe implementation of this rate limit already respects the bypass headers set by HAProxy for specific users, so some users are already exempted from the limit, see also [this conversation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73069#note_733627985).\n\nAlso, a configurable user allowlist has been implemented and exempted users have been added on Staging and Production here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6273.\n\nIn summary, this introduces rate limiting for the API endpoint `/users/:id`, in order to mitigate the risk of user enumeration, as part of the solution of [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29040)\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: group::optimize\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_manage_optimize`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @m_frankiewicz\n- PM: @hdelalic \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n- The Security Team\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThe API endpoint `/api/v4/users/:id` will be rate-limited to maximum 300 per 10 minutes per each logged-in user calling the API. Calls that are allowed to bypass rate limits by means of the [bypass header](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/user_and_ip_rate_limits.html#use-an-http-header-to-bypass-rate-limiting) are allowed to go above the limit. [Users that have been added to allowlist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6273) are also allowed to bypass the limit. Also, admin users are allowed to go above the limit.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf the rate limit turns out to be too stringent, it is possible that some legitimate user is being limited in how frequently they can call this API endpoint. In that case, the feature should be turned off, and a higher limit should be applied, after agreeing with security on what is appropriate.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nAn increase of 429 response statuses on calls to `/api/v4/users/:id` could indicate either an attempt to misuse the endpoint that is correctly stopped by this feature, or possibly a legitimate user that is hitting the limit.\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\nProduction logs for 429 response statuses on calls to `/api/v4/users/:id`. A high number of those would indicate that we are possibly limiting too many users.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

The supporting text, icons, and colours should help users to scan and quickly process the information. Further work to support this is detailed in #233161 |\n| The detailed status is not important to users after a successful import. | Mid | Not quite. The detailed status is the evidence that the import was successful. The user may even compare the numbers import issues (e.g.) to the number of issues in GitHub. | The proposed solution allows users to see the detailed import breakdown for successful imports. |\n| The detailed status is important to users after a partially successful import. | High | Yes | The solution could be improved in the future to provide more details about the specifics. |\n| The detailed status is important to users after an unsuccessful import. | Low | Yes, as it is now. However, if we add more data in the future, such as duration, what failed, etc., this may be important even for failed imports. | The solution doesn't give relevant details in a failed import. |\n| The detailed status alone is enough information for users to resolve a partially successful import. | Low | Only in some (few) cases. That said, even if they don't know how to fix it, the user could still use the detailed status to decide to reimport, or leave it as-is (good enough). | The solution could be improved in the future to provide more details about the specifics. |\n\n\n### Which fields do we want to show?\n\nThis is the final list of fields that we want displayed:\n* issue\n* label\n* milestone\n* pull_request (merge request)\n* release \n\n## Additional details\n\nThis additional information was [added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347433) to the import status endpoint.\n\nHere is a sample output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 27,\n  \"description\": null,\n  \"name\": \"gh_30086\",\n  \"name_with_namespace\": \"Administrator / gh_30086\",\n  \"path\": \"gh_30086\",\n  \"path_with_namespace\": \"root/gh_30086\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2021-12-07T17:45:44.870Z\",\n  \"import_status\": \"finished\",\n  \"import_type\": \"github\",\n  \"correlation_id\": \"01FPB00M3VX3SGVQYGBPBY6QCH\",\n  \"failed_relations\": [],\n  \"import_error\": null,\n  \"stats\": {                              // \u003c=== This is the new field\n    \"fetched\": {\n      \"diff_note\": 19,\n      \"issue\": 3,\n      \"label\": 1,\n      \"note\": 3,\n      \"pull_request\": 2,\n      \"pull_request_merged_by\": 1,\n      \"pull_request_review\": 16\n    },\n    \"imported\": {\n      \"diff_note\": 19,\n      \"issue\": 3,\n      \"label\": 1,\n      \"note\": 3,\n      \"pull_request\": 2,\n      \"pull_request_merged_by\": 1,\n      \"pull_request_review\": 16\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nExisting github import e2e test should be updated to additionally check that final status contains the correct imported objects.\n\n# Solution\n\nThe solution adds a **Details** [accordion](https://design.gitlab.com/components/accordion) to the table. \n\nThe solution also details other potential improvements that _could_ be made to to the importer experience.\n- Add `partial` import status.\n- Display status as a badge.\n- Allow cancel of an individual import.\n- Allow cancel of all remaining imports.\n\n| Screenshot | Description |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/7f0faf1fb853ac9e97607be34c36aa13/image.png) | List of statuses and their corresponding visual treatments.\u003cbr/\u003e- **Pending** changed to `neutral muted` to allow `warning` for **Partial import** |\n| ![image](/uploads/c04b96689579c523b09533dd709074b4/image.png) | List of status and their corresponding visual treatments for the details view. |\n| ![image](/uploads/a0af964df779236037eb1a7f6fe66fac/image.png) | **1.0 Default view**\u003cbr/\u003eList of repo's ready for import.

[x] Change the [gemnasium-gradle-plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin) to remove all filtering and instead output dependencies for all scopes. See [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin/-/merge_requests/19) for a starting point.\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin/-/merge_requests/19+\n\n1. [x] Publish a new version of the `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` with the above changes.\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin/-/jobs/2202996136\n   \n1. [x] Update `gemnasium` to use the new version of the `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` published in step `2.` above\n\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/22260f65066edff59f072c7c6ae6c43ba578320d/utils/gradle-plugin-builder/build.gradle#L5\n   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/22260f65066edff59f072c7c6ae6c43ba578320d/gemnasium-gradle-plugin-init.gradle#L8\n\n1. [x] Update `gemnasium` to remove duplicates from the `gradle-dependencies.json` file generated by the `gemnasium-gradle-plugin`.\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/8e6204d1375bae6ca698a36c2b376a39609db4b6/scanner/parser/mvnplugin/mvnplugin.go#L28-30\n\n1. [x] Add unit tests to `gemnasium` for the above behaviour\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/8e6204d1375bae6ca698a36c2b376a39609db4b6/scanner/parser/mvnplugin/mvnplugin_test.go\n\n1. [x] Add [image integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/) tests to `gemnasium` to ensure dependencies for `compile` and `implementation` directives are the same, and that nested dependencies are present. [This build.gradle](https://gitlab.com/adamcohen/348716-java-gradle/-/blob/use-compile-instead-of-implementation-directive/build.gradle#L16-20) file can be used for a test project with nested dependencies using the `compile` directive, and [this build.gradle](https://gitlab.com/adamcohen/348716-java-gradle/-/blob/gonzoyumo-master-patch-76599/build.gradle#L16-20) can be used for a test project with nested dependencies using the `implementation` directive.\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/7e056a7d6ce8a1c52ef47d3da3a1cdc56b14af59/spec/image_spec.rb#L94-110","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-16T16:00:51.377Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T03:32:41.820Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T23:48:55.691Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","missed-SLO","missed-deliverable","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","priority::1","release post item","section::sec","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"}],"author":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"user_notes_count":54,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348716","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348716","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348716/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348716/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348716","relative":"#348716","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348716"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":99174138,"iid":348713,"project_id":278964,"title":"It seems compliance_framework_setting projects edit API attribute is not documented","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIt seems there is a `compliance_framework_setting` projects edit API attribute which is not documented.

This change can easily introduce ~performance issues such as `n+1` situations. The feature flag allow us to rollout this change incrementally and provides a safety toggle that can be switched off in case of impactful issues.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Package\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#s_package`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @10io , @hortiz5  or `#s_package`\n- PM: @trizzi \n- EM: @michelletorres \n\n## Stakeholders\n\nn / a\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nNo user facing changes.\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nWhen the feature flag reaches 100%\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n* Package files are not properly returned by Manager APIs, Rest APIs or ~GraphQL APIs.\n* Manager APIs, Rest APIs or ~GraphQL APIs see a massive slowdown.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n* https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-package/stage-groups-group-dashboard-package-package?orgId=1 (excluding dashboards for container registry objects endpoints)\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n* https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-package/stage-groups-group-dashboard-package-package?orgId=1\nwith usual charts\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\nn / a as this is a ~\"feature flag\" on a global scope (not actor scoped)\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [-] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files 20`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files 50`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files 70`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `packages_installable_package_files`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `packages_installable_package_files` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete packages_installable_package_files --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete packages_installable_package_files --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete packages_installable_package_files`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set packages_installable_package_files false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-16T10:19:49.635Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T13:30:41.048Z","closed_at":"2022-02-07T13:30:41.020Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David

~\"GitLab Ultimate\".\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nThis came up on a customer call\n\nCurrently the we have only the ability to explicitly request specific environment(s) from the DORA API. API allows only 1 `environment_tier` which defaults to \"production\" if not set.\n\nThe customer original requested was to specifically exclude environments so they are not displayed on the aggregated DORA data. They are interested in production data, however they have multiple production environments across different geo regions and they wanted to exclude specific regions\n\nWe have a n ability to explicitly request specific environment(s) from the DORA API. The customer requested a way to specifically exclude environments so they are not displayed on the aggregated DORA data. \n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Change the 4 DORA APIs to return aggregated data for multiple tiers at the same time.\n2. Both for [REST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dora/metrics.html) and [GraphQL](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#dora).\n3.

This is because it does not return unique (by user) member results.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Modify `Member#set_membership_activation` to cater for the fact the user may already be an active member of the hierarchy\n1.

From UX research we found that most users close the drawer and find it annoying. On small screens the automatically open drawer creates usability problems. It's also not aligned with our Drawer usage guidelines in Pajamas and creates accessibility problems.\n\nThe drawer behavior and styling is also not aligned with the rest of the drawers in GitLab, and [doesn't align with the drawer component guidelines.](https://design.gitlab.com/components/drawer)\n\n#### Research\n\n[Insight](https://dovetailapp.com/projects/wM6XR37uGm1rxzqQYTOOm/insights/present/4KLaNWr228IXzeKVJGTuhY) - Pipeline editor opening automatically is unexpected and undesired in many cases. Users should be able to discover and manually open the drawer when they need it.\n\n## Proposal\n\nReplace the custom drawer component we use today with the gitlab-ui drawer component. This should cover the following requirements:\n\n- The drawer should trigger with a click of a \"Help\" button in the pipeline editor UI and have an explicit \"close\" button inside the drawer.\n- The \"Help\" button uses the small variant of the default button, and can be placed next to the \"Browse templates\" button in the editor. It also uses the \"information\" icon from the SVG library.\n- The drawer shouldn't be visible as a sidebar when it's closed. Closing the drawer should close it entirely.\n- Inside of the drawer shouldn't have the additional borders that separate the paragraphs of text, which is aligned with our efforts to \"unbox\" GitLab UI and keep it more clean. The background of the drawer should be white.\n\n![Updated_drawer](/uploads/f3321c75cbecca95847ce0078d7cc203/Updated_drawer.png)\n\nFor detailed drawer guidelines and the gitlab-ui component, see the [Drawer component page in Pajamas.](https://design.gitlab.com/components/drawer)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-15T05:10:02.514Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T16:55:31.835Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T07:24:00.874Z","closed_by":{"id":7598233,"username":"mgandres","name":"Mireya Andres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c96bce45a06f2dd722144db3f52456bf?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mgandres"},"labels":["Actionable Insight::Product change","Category:Pipeline Authoring","FY23::Q1","OKR","SUS::Impacting","UX","candidate::14.9","closed::complete","devops::verify","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::pipeline authoring","missed:14.9","section::ops","severity::3","type::feature","usability","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":7598233,"username":"mgandres","name":"Mireya Andres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c96bce45a06f2dd722144db3f52456bf?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mgandres"}],"author":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7598233,"username":"mgandres","name":"Mireya Andres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c96bce45a06f2dd722144db3f52456bf?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mgandres"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348523","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348523","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348523/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348523/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348523","relative":"#348523","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348523"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7289,"epic":{"id":405634,"iid":7289,"title":"Pipeline Editor Usability Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7289","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":{"id":44760,"iid":55,"sequence":12,"group_id":9970,"title":"Pipeline Authoring: March 21, 2022 - April 3, 2022","description":"Target milestone `14.10`","state":3,"created_at":"2022-01-09T00:05:02.621Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T00:05:02.153Z","start_date":"2022-03-21","due_date":"2022-04-03","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/44760"},"health_status":null},{"id":99056325,"iid":348520,"project_id":278964,"title":"Frontend: Disable the \"Commit\" and \"Reset\" buttons in the pipeline editor when no changes have been made","description":"\n\u003c!-- This issue template can be used as a great starting point for feature requests.

This experiment will be our MVC effort to test this cross-stage feature discovery concept. If proven successful, we will look to expand this discovery experience across multiple stages in the product.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\u003c!-- The hypothesis represents the high-level thought process in creating the experiment but does not need to be proven in one experiment. For example, you could have a hypothesis that “users would benefit from more easily being able to start a trial” and your first experiment could fail, that doesn’t void your hypothesis only indicates you may need to think of a new iterative experiment that would still align with your hypothesis. --\u003e\nWe believe by increasing discoverability of paid features we can increase the paid conversion rate.\n\n# Design\n\u003c!-- This should include the contexts that determine the reproducibility (stickiness) of an experiment. This means that if you want the same behavior for a user, the context would be user, or if you want all users when viewing a specific project, the context would be the project being viewed, etc. --\u003e\n\n## First iteration of the landing page\n \n#### Entry location\n \nThe user enters this experiment (their namespace is assigned a variant) when we render the `question_mark` menu (a.k.a. the “Help” menu or the `?` menu) in the top horizontal nav. At the moment of render, the variant assignment will determine if the “Discover Premium \u0026 Ultimate” menu item is added to the menu (`candidate`) or not (`control`).\n\n![CCSFDM_-_Menu_Item_-_discover_prem](/uploads/c8e79db308560e297583b43538a38cbc/CCSFDM_-_Menu_Item_-_discover_prem.png)\n\n#### Desktop\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n![LandingPage-MVC-Desktop-discover-prem](/uploads/1c035eec14cb7ddeb3d2439e03900db8/LandingPage-MVC-Desktop-discover-prem.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Mobile\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/5aa9c2707409d296020884132ea544c4/landing-page-mobile.gif\" width=\"250\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Flow Start a trial\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/c8d738f27f1bb0b608a34de17cf30080/start-trial-landing.gif\" width=\"450\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Flow Contact Sales\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/c12661f5d7eea8e4bbb08c593636ff71/landing-contact-sales.gif\" width=\"450\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n## Logo \u0026 Case studies approval\n[See this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343177#note_806827505)\n\n### [Design specs](https://www.figma.com/file/O3ZoGVX93vYoFO2oRcCqD9/Admin-Feature-Discovery?node-id=215%3A12862)\n\n\n# Rollout strategy\n\u003c!-- This is currently called A/B test, which isn't accurate for multi-variants. Let's call this rollout strategy. It should outline the percentages for variants and if there's more than one step to this, each of those steps and the timing for those steps (e.g. 30 days after initial rollout). --\u003e\n\nExperiment design:\n\n- Control: Standard experience without the discovery page\n- Candidate: Candidate group will be able to access and view the discovery page from the Help Menu (`?`) dropdown\n\nImplementation:\n\n* 80/20 (`control`/`candidate`) to start, then roll to 50/50 once data is validated\n\n# Inclusions and exclusions\n\u003c!-- These would be the rules for which given context (and are limited to context or resolvable at experiment time details) is included or excluded from the test. An example of this would be to only run an experiment on groups less than N number of days old. --\u003e\n\nInclusions:\n\n* Owner/admin members of namespaces which are on the Free tier\n\nExclusions:\n\n* All non-owner/admin members of all namespaces\n* All members of namespaces which are not on the Free tier\n\n**Note:** Users can be members of multiple namespaces, so they may see the experiment when in the context of one namespace and not when in the context of another.\n\n# Segmentation \n\u003c!-- Rules for always saying context with these criteria always get this variant. For instance, if you want to always give groups less than N number of days old the experiment experience, they are specified here. This is different from the exclusion rules above. --\u003e\n\nNone.\n\n# Success Metrics \u0026 Experiment Assignment [for Product Analytics] \n\n## Primary Success metric\n- Free to paid conversion rate\n\n## Secondary metric\n- Rate at which a primary action at the namespace level is taken with a primary action being defined as starting a trial, upgrading to a paid subscription, submitting a hand-raise PQL\n\n## Experiment Assignment \u0026 notes\n\n- We will assign [control or candidate] this experiment at the **namespace** level\n- We will pass assignment [control or candidate] to each individual event\n\n# Tracking Details\n \n## Snowplow tracking\n- [gitlab_experiment context json schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/iglu/-/blob/master/public/schemas/com.gitlab/gitlab_experiment/jsonschema/0-3-0)\n  - the `gitlab_experiment` context is automatically applied to every experiment-related event\n  - `namespace` and `user` as part of context `key` property, experiment will be sticky to the `namespace`\n- [gitlab_standard context json schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/iglu/-/blob/master/public/schemas/com.gitlab/gitlab_standard/jsonschema/1-0-8)\n  - the `gitlab_standard` context is automatically applied to every event\n  - will contain `user_id`, `namespace_id`, \u0026 `project_id` (when available)\n- see [taxonomy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/index.html#structured-event-taxonomy) for a guide.\n- `category` will default to the page we are on (i.e. `body.dataset.page`), except in the case of the `assignment` event where the `category` will be the experiment name: `fdm_deliver_software_faster`.\n\n| action | label |  Notes |\n| -------- | ------ | ----- |\n| `assignment` |  | This event will automatically happen _every time_ we render a page in a context where the user is eligible for the experiment. |\n| `click_question_mark_link` | `main_navigation` | A pre-existing event that we’re attaching experiment context to which fires for all users when they open the `?` dropdown. **Note:** Only participants in our experiment (whether in `control` or `candidate`) will have the additional `gitlab_experiment` context attached. |\n| `click_link` | `cross_stage_fdm` |  Event only fires for users in the `variant` that select our new link to the cross stage feature discovery page we've created for this test located within the `?` dropdown |\n| `render` | `cross_stage_fdm` | Event only fires for users in the `variant` that view the cross stage feature discovery page we've created for this test |\n| `click_button` | `start_trial` or `hand_raise_PQL` | Event only fires for users in the `variant` that click links within the cross stage feature discovery page we've created for this test either selecting \"start a free trial\" or \"contact sales\". Note we should capture this event whether they select the CTAs at the top of the page or the same CTAs located at the bottom. If a user selects both CTAs \"start a free trial\" and \"contact sales\" then we should fire two events. |\n \n## Core actions tracking\n \nIf a user selects to \"start a trial\" or \"contact sales\" then we want to ensure these actions are tracked. These values should be passed to the `leads` table utilizing the following values:\n \n| Location/CTA | GLM_source | GLM_content |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| \"start trial\" | gitlab.com | cross_stage_fdm |\n| \"contact sales | gitlab.com | cross_stage_fdm |\n\n- this will merely mean a param difference when clicking one of the buttons, which will eventually get populated in CustomersDot when the lead is submitted.\n\n### Event Tracking -

Because self-service SaaS customers have not historically been charged true-ups, the QSR process and the fact that they have to pay for overages is totally new. See tickets from customers [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/337).\n\n## Intended users\n\n- Group Owner or project Owner / Maintainer who adds additional members to a subscription, increasing the seat count\n- Only groups enrolled in quarterly subscription reconciliation. See exactly which use cases we're solving for in the [Epic description](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7230#intended-users).\n\n## Proposal\n\nWhen a Member or Group is being added that would **increase** the subscription's `Seats owed` number, show a second modal and ask the user to confirm that this action will result in additional charges before actually adding the Member. \n\nSome tricky use cases to keep in mind:\n- If the user (or users in a Group) being added as a Member(s) is already occupying a seat in the subscription, then the modal **should not** be shown\n- If on Ultimate, guest users **should not** trigger the modal because guest users do not occupy a seat\n- If the Member is being invited via email (not GitLab username) and that email address is not already occupying a seat in the subscription, then the modal **should** be shown. The Member being invited will not actually occupy a seat until they accept the invitation from their email (pending members don't occupy seats), but once they do accept the invitation they would occupy a seat immediately, so the user inviting them should be warned that they are taking an action that will trigger an overage.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eSome examples of when the modal would and wouldn't be shown\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nImagine that `Acme Corp` is your top level group. You invite `Group A` to `Project 1`. Let's assume that I have already exceeded my seat count (I'm at 12/10 seats in use).\n\n* If the members of `Group A` are already a part of `Acme Corp`, then it would not increase the `seats owed` number and the modal wouldn't be shown.\n* If the members of `Group A` were not already a part of `Acme Corp`, then the modal would be shown as the `seats owed` number would be increased.\n* Another possible situation is that part of the members of `Group A` are part of `Acme Corp` and part of the members are not. In this case, the modal would be shown because the members of `Group A` who are not currently a part of `Acme Corp` would increase the number of `seats owed`.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Design\n\n[Design here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347265/designs/Modal_that_informs_users_of_additional_charges_before_adding_a_member.png)\n\nWhen the modal that informs users of additional charges is shown, we should have a smooth transition in between the two modals.

All the other bridge jobs that successfully triggered downstream pipelines have the `gitlab-release-tools-bot` as the user. Bridge jobs that were skipped show `@hphilipps` (Release Manager at the time who has push access to master) as the user.\n\nPipeline bridge list API response: [bridge_jobs_list1.json](/uploads/d27ca5a73918520f877f290a3a38a9ec/bridge_jobs_list1.json)\n\n### Steps to reproduce (carried over from related https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326941#steps-to-reproduce)\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Create a project in groupA with the downstream pipeline\n1. Create a project in groupB with the source pipeline which triggers the project in groupA\n1. Test users with different combinations of access: so far I've tried unsuccessfully granting this user Maintainer on the downstream repo or groupA.\n\n~~This seems to be a transient bug, so I'm not sure how to reproduce it.~~\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nBridge job `deploy:gprd-cny` failed to start with error `No permissions to trigger downstream pipeline`.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!--

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75221. Unfortunately, that UX review of that MR only happened after it was merged, hence the need for this issue.\n\n1. When I add someone as reviewer/assignee, **their** attention state is OFF, **unless I refresh the page**. It should be automatically ON, without requiring a page refresh.\n1. Similarly, when I request someone's attention or add someone as a reviewer/assignee, **my** attention state is unchanged, **unless I refresh the page**. It should be automatically OFF, without requiring a page refresh.\n1. Related to the two previous points, if I then manually request their attention (because the state looks OFF), the content of the toast and system note are in conflict. The toast says “Attention requested” but the system note says “Removed attention request”. The real result, upon page refresh, is that the attention state is OFF.

Make sure the `Create a new branch` radio button is selected and give it a name containing some HTML, such as `\u003ch1\u003etest\u003c/h1\u003e`. \n1. Click `Commit`\n1. Visit `Settings` -\u003e `Repository` from the left-side menu and `Expand` the Protected Branches section\n1. Choose the branch you just made -- note that it will be we appear encoded as `\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;`\n1. Choose `No one` for both the `Allowed to merge` and `Allowed to push` dropdowns and click `Protect`\n1. On the project repository page, select the branch that you just protected (ex `\u003ch1\u003etest\u003c/h1\u003e`, click the `+` sign and choose 'Add a new file'. Enter a filename and some content and click `Commit changes`\n1. Notice that the changes made were applied directly to the branch (which is supposed to be protected)\n    * When a branch is properly protected, clicking `Commit changes` opens a merge request for that branch -- instead of the changes being directly applied\n\n# Original comment from HackerOne reporter\n\nBelow is the information provided by the HackerOne reporter:\n\nI think that this report got a fix in 14.5.2 (link). This is good news, but the patch does not fix all aspects of the reported vulnerability.\nThe patch adds this filter to the branch name when added as a protection\n```\ndef sanitize_branch_name(name)\n      name = CGI.unescapeHTML(name)\n      name = Sanitize.fragment(name)\n\n      # Sanitize.fragment escapes HTML chars, so unescape again to allow names\n      # like `feature-\u003emaster`\n      CGI.unescapeHTML(name)\nend\n```\nThis will take names such as feature-\u003emaster and return it as is. It will also take names such as `\u003ch1\u003etest\u003c/h1\u003e` and return test. The problem here is that GitLab does not enforce a consistent branch name standard. A problem is that \"HTML tags\" are not forbidden in branch names by Git, and thus branches created locally and then pushed to GitLab can have names containing HTML tags. A user can also create branch names containing HTML tags in the Web IDE, while creation of branches in the regular UI will strip HTML tags. This inconsistency is a bit confusing for users.\nWhat this lead to is that the \"protected branch\" feature is still broken for branches containing HTML. Trying to protect a branch like this will leave the branch unprotected as before, even when the branch is chosen in the dropdown.\nTest this by creating a branch in the Web IDE named `\u003ch1\u003etest\u003c/h1\u003e` and then try to protect it by picking the branch in the dropdown.\n\nI dont think that this constitutes a new vulnerability, but I do think that it should be addressed. And particularly, GitLab might need to chose if you are going to allow branch names containing HTML or not. And if not, document that these names that are allowed in Git are not allowed in GitLab.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-14T01:21:27.193Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T05:58:17.171Z","closed_at":"2022-02-04T18:40:51.508Z","closed_by":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Eng-Consumer::Security","Eng-Producer::Development","Engineering Allocation","HackerOne","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::create","group::source code","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":4226366,"username":"ankelly","name":"Andrew Kelly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4226366/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ankelly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-02-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348381","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348381","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348381/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348381/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348381","relative":"#348381","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348381"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7128,"epic":{"id":384256,"iid":7128,"title":"Security Engineering Allocation (Source Code BE): 10-NOV-2021","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7128","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98966893,"iid":348341,"project_id":278964,"title":"Experiment Cleanup: trial_registration_with_reassurance experiment","description":"## Summary\n\nThis experiment is in the process of being rolled out to 100% of users and has been deemed a success.

Prevent multi project pipeline graph from being available on Free tier","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nPipeline Graph for multi project pipeline is a premium feature, however it is available in ~\"GitLab Free\" \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a Multi project pipeline with a free account\n2. View the pipeline graph\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPipeline Graph for multi project pipeline is available in ~\"GitLab Free\" \n\n## What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPipeline Graph for multi project pipeline should not be available in ~\"GitLab Free\".\n\n- Since Free users who are using the multi-project pipeline graph could find it unexpected if the multi-project pipeline just disappeared from the graph, we need to show the multi-project pipeline card as we do today, but without the ability to expand the graph.\n- We need to notify them that it's a Premium feature and provide a path to upgrade. \n\n#### Specs\n\n- For Free tier users who use the multi-project pipelines we will show a multi-project pipeline card as it is today, with the \"expand\" button disabled. The disabled button should be styled like all GitLab disabled buttons (see the mock-up below).\n- When hovering over the disabled \"expand\" button, we should show the appropriate cursor and a popover explaining that the feature is Premium. It should include a header, \"premium\" badge and the body text with a \"Learn more\" link.\n- \"Learn more\" link should lead to the docs about the multi-project pipeline graph where the user can see what it looks like, how it works, and how to upgrade. \n\nFor more details on the behavior of the popover, see [this discussion thread.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348303/designs/Disabled_expand_button.png)\n\n### Implementation work\n\nBased of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348303#note_817124339\n\n* Update the pipeline query to get the paid plan\n* If the paid plan is anything above free, keep the current behaviour\n* If the plan is free, then instead of the card being expandable, we will show a popover that explains that to see it, you need to be on a higher tier of user plan.\n\n#### :art: [See the design attached below.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348303/designs/Disabled_expand_button.png)\n\n### Metrics\n\nIt'd be good to track the impact of this change on the upgrades to Premium. Should we track the clicks on the link inside the popover?\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe need to ensure that when the user clicks on \"Learn more\" in the popover that they're taken to information about how the multi-project pipeline looks, works, what benefits it provides, and provide a clear path to upgrade/ or do a free trial. ~documentation \n\nAnother idea we had was to write a blog post with more context about this change and link to the blog post instead.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs -

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set custom_preloader_for_deployments \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set custom_preloader_for_deployments \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set custom_preloader_for_deployments true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `custom_preloader_for_deployments`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `custom_preloader_for_deployments` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete custom_preloader_for_deployments --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete custom_preloader_for_deployments --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete custom_preloader_for_deployments`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set custom_preloader_for_deployments false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-13T09:11:24.143Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T09:53:47.303Z","closed_at":"2022-01-21T09:15:17.026Z","closed_by":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"labels":["devops::release","feature flag","feature::addition","group::release","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","section::ops","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"}],"author":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348289","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":20},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"20 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348289","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348289/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/348289/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#348289","relative":"#348289","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#348289"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98908535,"iid":348273,"project_id":278964,"title":"Swap foreign key  `project_pages_metadata.artifacts_archive_id` for loose foreign key","description":"We used this column temporarily when we were migrating pages to new architecture.

Loose foreign keys are cleaned up asynchronously which means when we perform a `DELETE FROM ci_job_artifacts` we will queue a cleanup task that will be executed in ~5 mins to cleanup all of the rows that reference this record. This can mean there are sometimes strange UX bugs where they may see a link to something that no longer exists and clicking it may give an error or it may mean there is a background job that runs and errors due to an invalid foreign key or it may mean a 500 when rendering a certain page containing any of the below tables. Some more details about risks and mitigations are being documented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76626 .\n\nThe ~\"group::sharding\" will be responsible for actually doing the work to convert the foreign keys to loose foreign keys but will likely need help from impacted teams to asses the risk and potentially determine or implement appropriate mitigation for any risks. Sometimes mitigation may mean refactoring code slightly to avoid errors or explicitly handling certain riskier cases by checking if there is a pending deletion for a record. It is also possible that we can optimize the 5 minute latency for cleanup in certain cases determined to be urgent.\n\n1.

Go to `Security \u0026 Compliance` -\u003e `Policies`\n1. Click `New Policy`\n1. Select `Scan Execution Policy` as the policy type\n1. Enter an invalid policy like `foo: bar`\n1. Submit and receive `Invalid policy type`\n1. Submit again and receive `Security Policy project already exists.`\n1.

The dropdown to change this selection is also quite subtle and most people will accept the default selection. This means the user does not get access to group features, existing users within the group cannot access it by default, and the user cannot easily upgrade the project to a paid tier as only groups can upgrade. \n \nRelated data insights can be found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/138#note_736747294\n \n# Solution\nWe should adjust the group selection dropdown that's required when creating a new project. If the user is only a member of one non-personal namespace group, then we should pre-select that non-personal group. If the user is a member of multiple groups then we should require them to select a value. The dropdown should continue to show the group options first and only show the personal namespace at the bottom of the listing indicating it as their personal namespace.\n \nNote this will not be run as an experiment; it will be a baseline improvement we simply ship directly to the product.\n\n# Design\n\n| Current | MVC | MVC with error msg |\n|---------|-----|--------------------|\n|

Group/namespace dropdown to the user's namespace\n* if a user only has one group (non-personal namespace), default to that group\n* otherwise, default to the instructions in the dropdown: `Pick a group or namespace`\n* fix the width of the group/namespace dropdown to fill approx. 1/2 of the total width\n  * we should also increase the width of the dropdown to match the width of its parent input\n* add the `/` between the group/namespace dropdown and the project slug input (this used to be in the UI but seems to have disappeared)\n* add form validation to the group/namespace dropdown after the user clicks the form submit button but before we actually submit the form fields to the server\n  * error message: `Pick a group or namespace where you want to create this project.`\n \n#
