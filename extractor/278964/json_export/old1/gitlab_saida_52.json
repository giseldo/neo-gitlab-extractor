[{"id":93285482,"iid":340333,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add search filtering by programming language","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nCurrently, in GitLab, there is no ability to filter searches by the programming language they are in.\n\n### Further details\n\nWhen searching in a large project (esp. translated projects) a string can be repeated hundreds of times in translation files when you are simply looking for the original usage in code.\n\nAlso, when searching for a particular function call that is popular across many languages it helps narrow the search if you know you only are looking for examples in Javascript.\n\nAdding this feature would greatly improve the usability of GitLab as an online source viewer/browser.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a programming language facet to search results in Global Search, utilizing Elasticsearch aggregations. The first iteration of this will only be available for Advanced Search (Elasticsearch).\n\n#### Tasks\n- [x] Perform benchmarking for utilizing aggregations for this\n- [x] Determine if counts will be viable for this first iteration\n  - [ ] If counts won't be included, determine the appropriate sort order for options (perhaps alpha or grouping by similar languages?)\n- [ ] ~backend Add aggregations for blob search calls. Put behind feature flag to measure performance impact and allow easy rollback \n- [ ] ~backend Expose aggregations for blob search calls to the controller\n- [ ] ~backend Add language filter support for blob searches\n- [ ] ~frontend Add language facet to blob search result page\n\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] When viewing the results of a search, user is able to see language facets in the left sidebar based on the result set\n- [ ] User is able to select multiple language facets to apply and update the results\n- [ ] Each language option will display the number of results that match that language (if counts included)\n- [ ] Options will be sorted by number of results – most to least (if counts included).\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nThe ability to filter searches by programming language being present.\n\n(If no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this)\n\n### Links / references\n\nGitHub

Next, the current code will not properly handle large files (see [this bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321361))\n\nHere are the details:\n* 🐛 When object storage is enabled, the first background job (that processes the `.changes` file) is not working. (blocker)\n  * This is coming on the actions in the package file object. We update the `package` reference but we can't simply `package_file.update!(package: package)`. This will break the link between the `package_file` and the physical file in object storage.\n  * I see several uses of `#use_file`. This is known to leave the `package_file` in an improper state that can't be saved. Basically, if `package_file.file.use_file` is called, then `package_file.save!` or `package_file.update!` can't be called (triggers a validation error).\n  * 🔧 Solution: package file updates where the package id or file_name are modified *must* be handled in a custom way. This is the result of the work on a similar [nuget](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321361) bug. In short, use [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1af8722a4235b94efb2e8f5f1a2f20a707106694/app/services/packages/update_package_file_service.rb). Also use `use_open_file` which is better than `use_file`.\n* 🐛 When an error occurs during the first background job, the files are left behind in the `incoming` package. Those files takes physical space in object storage.\n  * The situation is the following, when uploading a debian package, multiple files are uploaded and the last upload is the `.changes` file.\n  * All the package files are put in the *same* package: a versionless package named `incoming`.\n  * The problem with this approach is that if the worker fails, it will delete the `.changes` file but not the others.\n* 🐛 When a package is uploaded and it references a `codename` not present in the project distributions, the second job is still enqueued.\n  * I'm not sure why the background job doesn't simply fail if the `codename` is not found.\n* 🐛 The process changes worker moves the package files in a way that will not support large files. Similar to the nuget [bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321361) we got a few weeks ago.\n  * 🔧 Solution: same as above, switch to the new service that updates the package files in a way that is optimized for large files\n* 📈 Code cleanup/refactoring.

[x] We should check the May 2022 report.\n1. :white_check_mark: Our [April 2022 error budget](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/error-budget-reports/-/issues/7) was healty. We should check the May 2022 report.\n1. :heavy_check_mark:  Cleanup the combined_registration_experiment https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350754\n1. :heavy_check_mark:  When we cleanup `require_verification_experiment` experiment we shall also get rid of some insert queries.\n1. :white_check_mark:  Applying the trial has moved to a separate controller.\n1. Group creation + project creation or import | onboarding project creation.\n\nI think here we face a tradeoff between combined/quick onboarding which is useful vs error budgets which tell us the reverse (separating user onboarding elements). I believe we should value the business acumen, and prefer the results of the combined onboarding to slightly increased error budgets.\n\n\n\n## Analysis of the code base\n\n### GroupsProjectsController#create\n\n| Code | Budget |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Group.find_by_id(group_id) | low |\n| Groups::CreateService.new(current_user, modified_group_params).execute | High |\n| combined_registration_experiment.track(:create_group, namespace: @group) | Low |\n| combined_registration_experiment.track(:create_project, namespace: @project.namespace) | Low |\n| helpers.require_verification_experiment.record_conversion(@group) | Low |\n| ::Projects::CreateService.new(current_user, create_project_params).execute | High |\n| create_learn_gitlab_project | High |\n        \n\n\n### GroupsProjectsController#import\n\n\n| Code | Budget |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Groups::CreateService.new(current_user, modified_group_params).execute | High |\n| apply_trial_when_in_trial_flow | High |\n| combined_registration_experiment.track(:create_group, namespace: @group) | Low |\n| helpers.require_verification_experiment.record_conversion(@group) | Low |\n\n     \n\n## Discussions\n\nDiscussed here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340206#note_671187309\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340206\n\n\n[Profiling](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/profiling.html#speedscope-flamegraphs)\n\n\n## Query Limiting - ee/registrations/groups_projects_controller#create\n\nThis issue is an area for discussion of the newly created `ee/registrations/groups_projects_controller#create` action.\n\nThis action exceeds the query limiting threshold by more than 2x.\n\nThe main culprit is the `Projects::CreateService`, but secondarily is the extraneous tracking calls in both experiment libraries.\n\nI've seen a couple other \"Query Limiting\" issues (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21139 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/20826) focused on the `Projects::CreateService`, but this would be the first one raising concern about the tracking calls for experimentation. I believe it's in our best interest to background all experiment tracking calls that we can.\n\nThis note [has been raised](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64551#note_611904313) by @jejacks0n previously.\n\nMy suggestion going forward for this controller would be, given it is an experiment, that we run it at maybe 25%, and if we do see that it outperforms the control, that when its time to promote it, we separate the 2 end points, and make 2 asynchronous calls to create the group, and project objects. \n\nrelated

main branch against Ruby 3 in a scheduled pipeline","description":"Recently we were able to achieve our first green(-ish) build for our Ruby 3 MR :tada: : the only two job failures came from the upstream, and all downstream pipelines and QA were passing: https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CGN8BUCKC/p1650463827523419, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/pipelines/520562059.\n\nThe [next step](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5149#milestone-3-green-build-incl-qa-for-gitlab) is to run Ruby 3 pipeline on a regular basis, ideally for every MR.\n\n## Plan\n\nTo support the deployment of Ruby 3 to GitLab.com, we eventually need to have a green build on the `master` branch. We think that building every MR against Ruby 3 on top of Ruby 2 is too costly (see estimation below), so instead we will implement a staged approach to testing:\n\n- **Milestone 1:** Developers and CI run on Ruby 2 by default, by every 2 hours we run a Ruby 3 pipeline against `master`. This pipeline is just _informative and must not block deployments or disrupt other workflows._ Errors should only be communicated to developers working on the Ruby 3 migration.\n- **Milestone 2:** If we find that these Ruby 3 builds are mostly stable, and we understand the kinds of regressions that occur, we can devise a workflow for developers (separate issue) for how to tackle such failures and extend the audience of these builds to _every contributor_. At this point it is expected that if a changeset breaks these builds, the commit authors tackle these (with of our help, if necessary).\n- **Milestone 3:** If we find that this workflow works well enough, and enough contributors have been exposed to Ruby 3 related builds and failures (i.e. confidence is established in keeping these green), we will _swap the 2-hour schedule with Ruby 2_. At this point, every MR will build against Ruby 3, and Ruby 2 is only tested against every 2 hours, and before deployments. We should consider to have developers swap over their default Ruby to Ruby 3 at this point.\n- **Milestone 4:** This would coincide with running Ruby 3 in production; we remove the 2-hourly Ruby 2 build and Ruby 3 becomes the new default.\n\n## Rough approximation of additional CI costs\n\nAdditional cost of running Ruby 2 jobs on 2-hourly scheduled pipelines:\n\n* We have 94 RSpec jobs\n* RSpec jobs average duration is approximately 25 minutes\n* Cost per hour of runner VM: $0.095\n* Total additional hours per pipeline: `25 * 94 / 60 = 39.1`\n* Total additional cost per pipeline: `39.1 * $0.095 = $3.7`\n* We have 12 2-hourly scheduled pipelines per day\n* Total additional cost per day: `$3.7 * 12 = $44.4`\n* Running these duplicated tests for a year (e.g. until 16.x is released) would result in an additional: `$44.4 * 365 = $16,206`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-07T13:22:58.839Z","updated_at":"2022-10-12T08:48:55.745Z","closed_at":"2022-09-27T13:40:27.992Z","closed_by":{"id":4713264,"username":"mkaeppler","name":"Matthias Käppler","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4713264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkaeppler"},"labels":["Category:Application Performance","Engineering Productivity","auto updated","devops::data_stores","group::application performance","maintenance::pipelines","missed:15.1","missed:15.3","missed:15.4","priority::2","section::enablement","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},{"id":6290669,"username":"godfat-gitlab","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6290669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat-gitlab"}],"author":{"id":4713264,"username":"mkaeppler","name":"Matthias Käppler","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4713264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkaeppler"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"user_notes_count":133,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340298","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340298","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340298/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340298/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#340298","relative":"#340298","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#340298"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8101,"epic":{"id":525613,"iid":8101,"title":"Ruby 3: Green builds and scheduled pipeline","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8101","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 31, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e16\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93255505,"iid":340283,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Remove `environment_last_visible_pipeline_disable_joins`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [avoid release features cross joining with ci database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338006) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `environment_last_visible_pipeline_disable_joins` feature flag.\n\nIt is default-enabled so we need not do a manual rollout.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

invalid cross-DB transaction when deleting project builds","description":"Context originally from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339813 (and notes the comments https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339813#note_669072215\n\n## Summary\n\nSuper high level problem detail.\n\nWhen deleting a project we:\n\n1. start a transaction\n2. delete the `ci_builds` rows\n3. delete the `projects` row\n4. commit the transaction\n\nWe cannot allow such use of transactions when `ci_*` tables are moved to a separate database because the queries against the other database won't actually be in a transaction. This means that it could give the impression you are going to have rollback support etc. but it won't necessarily work and we don't believe it's a good idea to implement a 2 phase commit transaction approach across the 2 databases.\n\nThis is primarily caused by the use of `dependent: :destroy` in:\n\n`Project  has_many :builds, class_name: 'Ci::Build', inverse_of: :project, dependent: :destroy`\n\n## Possible Solution\n\nRead more at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/multiple_databases.html#removing-cross-database-transactions\n\nThere is already re-architecture work that relates to this deletion code path in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24644 . It's possible the solution to that may also solve this problem.\n\n## Other discussed solution\n\nWe recommend you find a different way that allows for deleting the builds in a robust way. Recommendation so far:\n\n1. Make `FastDestroyAll` accept an option to skip the `delete_all` step and therefore allow other things to take care of the deletion (e.g. real foreign key or [\"loose foreign key\"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69165))\n1. Make `FastDestroyAll` more robust so that we can use it for `Project -\u003e builds` (can you expand on what is needed here to make it robust)\n1. Convert `ci_builds.project_id` to a \"loose foreign key\" and then use `FastDestroyAll` for `Project -\u003e ci_builds`\n\nThere may also be simpler options that just push most of `ci_builds` cleanup work to Sidekiq or even just move the `delete_all` logic after the transaction completes.\n\n## How to validate the problem is solved\n\nWe introduced a tool for raising errors in tests when these kinds of transaction problems are detected https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67213 . You can wrap some piece of code in `with_cross_database_modification_prevented` in a test to detect if that isolated piece of code has a problem. Alternatively you can use the `ci_data_modification_check` tag on a spec to do the same thing but it covers the whole spec so it may detect extra things in factories or `let` statements that make it harder to isolate your specific fix.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-07T03:17:30.687Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T16:29:53.309Z","closed_at":"2022-01-25T08:53:13.592Z","closed_by":{"id":3944199,"username":"fzimmer","name":"Fabian

It's understandable because even when the JSON response is cached, the post processing and policy checks will still need to run on each of those 100+ discussions/notes. This was found out in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335566#note_667218572.\n\n## Proposal\n\nFollow the same pagination approach we did for diffs by having a `diffs_batch.json` but this time for discussions (something like `discussions_batch.json`. This way, one big request will be split into multiple smaller requests though still sequentially loaded.\n\n### Pros\n\n- We'll be able to show discussions by chunks resulting to faster response times.\n- Faster response time means we'll be able to show discussions quicker bit by bit. This leads to better UX in my opinion since user can see discussions earlier than seeing a loading state.\n- Faster response time means a Puma worker won't be blocked for a long time so it'll have time to perform other requests.\n- Apdex score of this endpoint will improve since it won't take long anymore.\n\n### Cons\n\n- Additional complexity because paginating this resource isn't that straightforward it seems.\n- It's just splitting the big request to smaller request but they can't be loaded in parallel.\n\nRelated to #335566.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-06T10:25:31.126Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T14:26:26.653Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T02:58:18.201Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"labels":["Deliverable","backend","bug::performance","devops::create","feature::enhancement","group::code review","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"}],"author":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick Bajao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1884221/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/patrickbajao"},"user_notes_count":30,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340172","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340172","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340172/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340172/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#340172","relative":"#340172","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#340172"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1577,"epic":{"id":9297,"iid":1577,"title":"⏳ Progressively load merge request discussions","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1577","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93148624,"iid":340151,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Enable verified email to enable 2FA","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35102) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ensure_verified_primary_email_for_2fa` feature flag.\n\nThe MR that enables/removes the flag should also update the docs https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69593#note_670119833.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::access\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_manage_access_topic_security_burndown`\n- Best individual to reach out to: `@.luke`\n- PM: `@stkerr` \n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340151#global-rollout-on-production\n\n- Rollout on GitLab.com for at least `3 days`\n\nWe don't expect errors, but Sentry will be checked.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `ensure_verified_primary_email_for_2fa` feature flag.

\"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nPagination on GitLab groups \"Usage quotas\" page for \"Pipelines\" or \"Storage\" links to \"Seats\" page \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n1. Find a GitLab group that has more than 20 repos (so that pipeline pagination is required) \n2. Navigate to GitLab groups \"Usage quotas\" page (`https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas`), which silently redirects to `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas#seats-quota-tab`\n3. Navigate to \"Pipelines\" page (`https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas#pipelines-quota-tab`)\n4. Click on \"page 2\" link at the bottom of the page\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nThis needs a GitLab group that the user has owner role in that has usage quotas. I am a member of such a group but it is private\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\nURL for `page 2` link is `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas?page=2`, which silently redirects to `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas?page=2#seats-quota-tab`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\nHotfix: URL for `page 2` link for pipelines should be `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas?page=2#pipelines-quota-tab` and for storage should be `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas?page=2#storage-quota-tab`\n\nCorrect fix: The type of usage quota should be provided in the path component of the URL, not the fragment part, since these are separate documents, not parts of the same document (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment). So the URLs should be:\n- `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas/pipelines?page=2`\n- `https://gitlab.com/groups/\u003cgroupid\u003e/-/usage_quotas/storage?page=2`\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-05T05:07:59.908Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T18:36:35.058Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T18:36:35.044Z","closed_by":{"id":8858358,"username":"sheldonled","name":"Sheldon Led","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a4252822d6a503697403c631ca987dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sheldonled"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Utilization","devops::fulfillment","frontend","group::utilization","priority::2","section::fulfillment","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":8858358,"username":"sheldonled","name":"Sheldon Led","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a4252822d6a503697403c631ca987dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sheldonled"}],"author":{"id":5749573,"username":"Woodz1","name":"Richard Wise","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07b22240e5339c47e32266bf21428f2a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Woodz1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8858358,"username":"sheldonled","name":"Sheldon Led","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a4252822d6a503697403c631ca987dc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sheldonled"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340125","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340125","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340125/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340125/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#340125","relative":"#340125","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#340125"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93113868,"iid":340110,"project_id":278964,"title":"Mention that translation helpers should only be called with string literals","description":"* Follows up on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/eslint-plugin/-/merge_requests/56#note_667338673\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/eslint-plugin/-/issues/41 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/eslint-plugin/-/issues/43, we've added ESLint rules to prevent translations helpers from being called with anything else than strign literals in Js and Vue files.

While we have the `Open in Web IDE` button on these views, it could become a pattern that people expect to find in GitLab. \n\n## Proposal\n\nOpen the Web IDE when someone types `.` on a repository view. \n\nThe Web IDE should open in the same tab.\n- This is similar to the default behaviour of the \"Open in WebIDE\" button. It is noted that this button is a link and thus users could choose to open link in new tab and this `.` flow would not have the similar option.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Do we have any other shortcuts that would conflict here? \n1. Is there a different shortcut that makes sense?\n\n## More info\n\nSee this related [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28402009)\n\n## The implementation plan\n\n1. Add a hidden menu item in `lib/sidebars/projects/menus/hidden_menu.rb`. Use the properly constructed link to WebIDE for the project as `link` param\n1. Add a new keybinding to `app/assets/javascripts/behaviors/shortcuts/keybindings.js` under the `project.*` namespace, apparently since we want to open WebIDE for a repository, and not introduce it as a global keystroke\n1.

about feature-flagged GraphQL entities","description":"We currently provide some hints on how to deal with feature flags in GraphQL queries but it has some flaws:\n\n* We recommend using the `@include` directive, but we do not clearly state that this requires feature-flagged entities to exist in the schema, no matter what the directive evaluates to. So, in the case where the flag is off, we should recommend that the corresponding resolver returns `null` in the backend.\n    * We could also mention the `@skip` directive which is the opposite of `@include` and can be used for similar purposes.\n* It might be worth mentioning that another option to dealing with this is to maintain 2 versions of a client-side query: one including the new fields, and the other one without them. Then, the client should trigger the correct query based on the feature flag's state. This is a less maintainable approach as it involves duplicated code, but it can be useful in cases where the field is removed from the schema when the flag is off.\n\n/cc @farias-gl","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-02T08:12:41.521Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T04:51:25.614Z","closed_at":"2021-09-15T07:05:06.735Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["GraphQL","Technical Writing","documentation","group::analyzer frontend","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"}],"author":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339932","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339932","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339932/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339932/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339932","relative":"#339932","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339932"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92952283,"iid":339889,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add pipeline creation step duration histogram to Pipeline Execution Grafana dashboard","description":"# Context\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332891, we began gathering data on the duration (in seconds) of each pipeline creation step.

The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\nToday users set up compliance frameworks in their groups and apply them to projects. This allows them to segment which projects need additional controls and enforce compliance pipelines where applicable. However, users must manually add the frameworks to projects as they are created. This is time consuming to check when projects are made and to manually set the framework to apply.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nProvide a group-level setting to specify a default compliance framework that should be added to all newly created projects in the group. See attached design file for UX.\n* Note that there should be an option for `None` (or similar) to allow the user to not provide any default compliance framework if they do not wish to.\n\n### Design\n\n![image](/uploads/2f91f569bb0e0bfb7afb22aaca993d5c/image.png)\n\n| List | Set default | Remove default |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/2bfc4e88a4f004680459c726d839fe3d/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/715657e16f7903c697bf08192d82742e/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/1353377575a9e60dd2a93d73ce279d6f/image.png) |\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Premium\" \n\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n~database :two: \n\n1. Add a migration to add `default_compliance_framework` (INT) as a new column to the `namespace_settings` table.\n\n~backend :three: \n\n1. Update `ee/app/services/ee/projects/create_service.rb` so that whenever a new project is under a group and the group has set a default compliance framework then create a new `ComplianceManagement::ComplianceFramework::ProjectSettings` with `project_id` as the current project and `framework_id = project.root_namespace.default_compliance_framework.id)`. We can define a method `default_compliance_framework` in `group.rb` as follows:\n```ruby\ndef default_compliance_framework\n  default_compliance_framework_id = namespace_settings.default_compliance_framework\n  ComplianceManagement::Framework.where(id: default_compliance_framework_id)\nend\n```\n2. Whenever a framework is deleted check if it is the default framework, in case it is then prevent the deletion and show an error message to the user.\n\n~frontend a big :three: / small :five: \n\n_Related issue to update the list to match the designs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371013+_\n\n1. Update the GraphQL [query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/groups/settings/compliance_frameworks/graphql/queries/get_compliance_framework.query.graphql#L18-19) to also fetch the `default` status of each framework.\n1. Add a mutation to the list view to set the `default` attribute of a framework.\n1. Add an [ellipses icon](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~ellipsis_h) in a [`GlButton`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-button--dropdown-icon-only-button) to the end of the actions.\n1. Move the delete action to the ellipses dropdown.\n   - Note: Default frameworks cannot be deleted.\n1. Add an action for marking the framework as `default` when not default.\n1. Add an action for removing the `default` status of a framework when it is default.\n1. Update [`list_item.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/groups/settings/compliance_frameworks/components/list_item.vue#L36) to display a [`GlBadge`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/docs/base-badge--default) when the item is `default`.\n1.

If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

During investigation it was found that even with a single operation provided, the test still timed out. The main culprit was found to be scanning a large static body that was returned in some error cases. Time the response analysis assertion ran it took over 10 seconds to complete.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### 1. Review regexes for speed\n\nIt was found that several regexes use \".*\" in the patterns which causes a slowdown and are not needed. In the worst case, a single regex was timing out after 10 seconds for a 53K body.\n\nA test has been added to look for slow regexes.\n\n#### 2. Implement a response cache for bodies \u003e15K\n\nFor API's, it's often the case that larger bodies are static content that doesn't change between requests (with the exception of XML). As such, using a fast hash method such as xxHash can allow for caching results of our regex pass for a large body.\n\n1. Stop adding to cache if entries \u003e1024. In the case that returned bodies are often different, turn cache readonly.\n1. Calculate xxHash64 using `context.Exchange.Response.Body`, use as key into dictionary of cached results.\n1. If cached result found, return. Otherwise continue normally and store any return.\n\n#### 3. Perform some optimizations of existing code\n\n1.

The ~backend work for this issue is to only take care of the order of the jobs without explicit `needs` in the job dependencies view. The links between the jobs with implicit dependencies should be hidden.\n\n### Proposal\n\nfrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330079#note_657835314\n\nWe have a `combinedNeeds` array in the API.\n\n```ruby\n{\n  needs: [\n    { name: \"job_1\" },\n  ],\n  combinedNeeds: [\n    { name: \"job_1\", type: \"explicit\" },\n    { name: \"job_2\", type: \"implicit\" }\n  ]\n}`\n```\n\nThe naming here is tricky, but this allows us to use the benefits from approach 1, without breaking the current API implementation. Having the needs in two places feels a little strange, but maybe we can get around that by deprecating the original one and phasing it out for the next major release.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

Weight rollup","description":"## Problem\n\n1. Several customers have vocalized the desire to add weight directly to an epic. This is useful when doing ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) estimation before an epic is decomposed into smaller vertical slices and estimated by a development team. \n1. As we move towards work items with Tasks as the first step, users will naturally want to be able to set a weight on a Task. Given that issues already have `weight` as a field, we need to consider how weight ought to behave within this new model. \n\n## Proposal\n\n- A user can set a numeric weight on any work item into an `Weight` field. \n- Aggregate weights from children also show alongside/next to the work item's weight in a `Rollup Weight` that is system calculated and not editable.

mocks are a bit scattered and it can be difficult to find them to use them in new frontend specs.\n\nLet's regroup those mocks in dedicated timezones fixtures.\n\nThis will support the work being done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328752 as it also requires some timezone

Snowplow logic from Gitlab::Tracking module to Gitlab::Tracking::Destinations::Snowplow class","description":"Related https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337473\n\n# Summary\n\nIn order to be easy to add a new destination, we should consolidate the logic around the tracking library.\n\nMove Snowplow logic from Gitlab::Tracking module to Gitlab::Tracking::Destinations::Snowplow class\n\n# Why?\n\nThis is a refactoring so we could add a new destination easier. \n\nWe might add as destination the Gitlab Snowplow collector\n\n# Details\n\n- The public API for tracking should be accessible through `Gitlab::Tracking` module.\n- From `Gitlab::Tracking` we should use different destinations like `Destinations::ProductAnalytics`, `Destinations::Snowplow` and others\n- The destination classes should not refer to  `Gitlab::Tracking` module, this is creating a circular dependency\n- `Gitlab::Tracking` module should not have destination-specific logic like snowplow_options\n\n# Requirements\n\n- `Gitlab::Tracking` module should be the public API for tracking events and collecting them to multiple destinations\n\n# Proposal\n\n- Rename `snoplow_options` method to `options` from`Gitlab::Tracking` module.\n- `options` method should take the configuration from the `snowplow` tracker\n- There should be a single source for snowplow configuration and should live in `Gitlab::Tracking::Destinations::Snowplow`\n- Move `SNOWPLOW_NAMESPACE` constant in `Gitlab::Tracking::Destinations::Snowplow` class\n- Remove the circular dependency from `Gitlab::Tracking::Destinations::Snowplow` `enabled?` method\nin the enabled method we should check for ` Gitlab::CurrentSettings.snowplow_enabled?`\n\n```ruby\nmodule Gitlab\n  module Tracking\n

Split Registration flow based on if the user is joining an existing team or setting up a new one","description":"## Experiment summary\n\nWe believe that by asking users if they are setting up a new team or joining an existing one we'll be able to simplify the Registration Flow for users joining teams and increase group related conversion rates by limiting the noise that comes with groups that are not planned to be used. \n \nTo verify that, we will create an experience that forks the Registration Flow based on this question \n\nAnd we’ll measure the impact on group/project creation rates as well as trial and paid conversion. \n\n## Hypothesis\n\u003c!-- The hypothesis represents the high-level thought process in creating the experiment but does not need to be proven in one experiment. For example, you could have a hypothesis that “users would benefit from more easily being able to start a trial” and your first experiment could fail, that doesn’t void your hypothesis only indicates you may need to think of a new iterative experiment that would still align with your hypothesis. --\u003e\n\nWe have a large % of users that are setting up accounts with the intention of joining an existing team. We currently require all new accounts that are created outside of the invitation flow to create groups and projects, but in many cases this is an extra and unwanted step. \n\n## Business problem\n\u003c!-- Where the hypothesis is focused on the user/customer, the business problem represents why/how an experiment in this area could positively impact the business. For example, trials represent a significant way for GitLab to produce valuable leads for the sales team. --\u003e\n\nThe Registration Flow flow can feel overly heavy for a user that is joining an existing team. Since the team member experience is critical and most stage adoption happens by users other than the namespace creator, we need to ensure a simple and delightful experience for creating an account and joining a team. \n\n## Supporting data\n\u003c!-- Why should we run this experiment? What’s the potential impact? Show supporting data that’s both qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative example, we generate 30,000 sign ups a month and 900 trails within 90 days (3%) with a close rate of 10% and an IACV of $400.  If we’re able to increase our trial volume by 10% percent (990 trials a month) we will generate an additional $3,600 IACV if our close rates remain constant. Qualitative example, in searching Zendesk I was able to find 10 support tickets in the last 30 days that referenced difficulties with starting a trial due to the user not being an admin. (all numbers are hypothetical and only listed for the purpose of having an example) --\u003e\n\nFor both invited and non-invited users, the number 1 reason for creating a GitLab account is to join an existing team: \n\n![image](/uploads/3c061d1891b7723d53c92b0661ab1602/image.png)\n\n\n## Expected outcome\n\u003c!-- What is the expected outcome of this experiment, what metric are we trying to move? Are there any metrics we know we do not want to impact? For example, we want to impact IACV by increasing the rate at which users start trials within 30 days but we also want to ensure we don't increase the churn rate for users who've recently purchased. --\u003e\n\nWe see a reduction in the group namespaces that are created and an increase in conversion and adoption metrics for the namespaces created in this experiment vs. the control. \n\n## Experiment design \u0026 implementation\n\u003c!-- What is the experiment we’re going to run? How long do you believe it will need to run to reach significance? For example, our experiment would be to allow non-admins to request a trial through their admin, to detect a 10% change from our baseline conversion rate we’ll need a sample size of 57,000 (source Optimizely), with our current sign up rate of 30,000 a month this experiment will need to run for ~2 months. (all numbers are hypothetical and only listed for the purpose of having an example) --\u003e\n\nThoughts on initial flow: \n\n1. Create a new question specifically for determining if the user is creating a new team or joining an existing one\n   1. We should consider keeping the JTBD question and remove the \"joining an existing team\" option  \n1. If they are joining an existing one, skip the group/project creation step(s) and take them to the dashboard \n\nIn terms of tracking, we should make sure we're storing the user_ids of users in the control and candidate in the `experiment_users` table so we can track downstream impact. \n\n\n## ICE score\n\n\u003c!-- See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/growth/#growth-ideation-and-prioritization --\u003e\n\n| Impact | Confidence | Ease | Score |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| value 1 |  value 2 |  value 3 | Average(1:3) |\n\n## Known assumptions\n\u003c!-- This is an area to call out known assumptions in the experiment, this is especially helpful for any future colleagues that join the team so they understand other potential influences and how they were accounted for. This section is also helpful in framing possible scenarios and to keep the door open for the next steps. For example, we’re hoping our experiment will increase the number of people that start a trial but we’re assuming the conversion rate to paid and IACV will remain the same. This is a known assumption and depending on the results of the experiment could impact the direction we take on any future iterations. --\u003e\n\n## Results, lessons learned, next steps\n\u003c!-- What were the results of the experiment? Was the experiment a success or a failure? Based on the results should we remove the code or advocate that it become a permanent part of the experience for all users? Are there future experiments the team is going to run based off these results (include a link to new issue)? For example, our trial experiment was successful we increased the trial create rate by 10% but we saw a 1% drop in our close rate which means our net impact on IACV was negative $360 (990 * 0.09 * 400 compared tot he control of 900 * 0.1 * 400). Our next experiment (link) will focus on increasing the value once a user starts a trial. (all numbers are hypothetical and only listed for the purpose of having an example) --\u003e\n\n\n## Checklist\n\n* [ ] Fill in the experiment summary and write more about the details of the experiment in the rest of the issue description.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing projects/groups first\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on production environment. `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [x] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-30T08:21:24.973Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T14:00:23.646Z","closed_at":"2021-11-17T12:05:42.382Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing projects/groups first\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment. `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [x] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [x] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-26T17:37:29.123Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T14:35:47.867Z","closed_at":"2021-09-13T14:35:47.845Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"labels":["auto updated","feature flag","missed:14.2"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"}],"author":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339511","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":50,"completed_count":39},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"39 of 50 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339511","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339511/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339511/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339511","relative":"#339511","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339511"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92655986,"iid":339509,"project_id":278964,"title":"Replace \"Enforcement Status\" with \"Status\"","description":"\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\nThe following discussion from !68806 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @jiaan started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68806#note_662075618):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **Question:** This is more of a ~\"Technical Writing\" question, but overall there is a shift towards using [sentence case](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#headings) so are we sure this should be changed to title case?

This is likely resulting in a significantly lower cycle time than reality within the VSA report. [Internal Slack thread](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJZR6KPB4/p1629993319003200)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. This issue (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/gsoc-sast-vulnerability-rules/playground/sast-rules/-/issues/18) was created on `2021-08-11 4:28am EDT`. The MR was created on `2021-08-11 11:03am EDT`. The MR was merged on `2021-08-13 8:51am EDT`. The first commit pushed up was on `2021-08-11 11:21am EDT`. \n1. The cycle time for this issue shows `\u003c 1s` because of this commit https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/gsoc-sast-vulnerability-rules/playground/sast-rules/-/commit/9ce6ebee55efcaa4ff8fc5dc6ae7aaac84204f51, which automatically closed the issue. This is not the right commit to use for calculating the cycle time. \n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nThis impacts all Groups and Projects likely. See \"Steps To Reproduce\" for specific links. \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nThe cycle time is not calculated correctly. \n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe cycle time is calculated by the MR creation date. If there is an earlier commit that can be associated to an issue, for example via relating a branch to an issue before an MR is opened, we should use this timestamp. In any event, it should always be calculated by the earliest possible timestamp related to any indicator that work on an issue has started. \n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nWe need to fix the code which sets the `first_mentioned_in_commit_at`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/issues/close_service.rb#L89\n\nLet's use the authored date from the MR diff commits table.

A vulnerability has a `name` and not a `title`. Looking at the [model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5526b946b8c81df83f867ee9f1204b555dbc18c6/ee/app/models/ee/vulnerability.rb), I can see that there is both a name and a title, but I'm not sure how the title normally gets set. The [report parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5526b946b8c81df83f867ee9f1204b555dbc18c6/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/common.rb) does not seem to be responsible for doing it.\n1. On the security report, an identifier looks like this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"cve\",\n     \"name\": \"CVE-2019-20367\",\n     \"value\": \"CVE-2019-20367\",\n     \"url\": \"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20367\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   and the identifier is created from these fields like this:\n\n   ```ruby\n   ::Gitlab::Ci::Reports::Security::Identifier.new(\n     external_type: identifier['type'],\n     external_id: identifier['value'],\n     name: identifier['name'],\n     url: identifier['url'])\n   ```\n\n   This is quite different from how `ManuallyCreateService` works. It derives the type from the name (despite there being an `externalType` field), and it also uses the name as the `external_id` (despite there being an `externalId` field).\n1. The way that the scanner data is collected is similarly inconsistent. `vulnerabilityCreate` has a top-level `scannerName` field, which [is used as both the scanner name and the external_id](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5526b946b8c81df83f867ee9f1204b555dbc18c6/ee/app/services/vulnerabilities/manually_create_service.rb#L129).\n\n   Whereas, on the security report, the scanner data is collected using this data in a field named `.scan.scanner`:\n\n   ```json\n   \"scanner\": {\n     \"id\": \"starboard_trivy\",\n     \"name\": \"Trivy (via Starboard Operator)\",\n     \"url\": \"https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy\",\n     \"vendor\": {\n       \"name\": \"GitLab\"\n     },\n     \"version\": \"0.15.0\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Implementation

`VulnerabilityScannerVendorInputType`","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-26T17:01:35.698Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:53:04.068Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T11:56:57.423Z","closed_by":{"id":487608,"username":"Quintasan","name":"Michał
