It is currently enabled by default. Initially, its purpose was to allow an easy way to disable the pipeline creation step histogram because a situation happened previously where there was a mistake with the labels in a histogram that created problems with Prometheus. However, we have discovered that that there is a significant rate of observations done (10-15 pipelines per second multiplied by 22 pipeline creation steps on GitLab.com), and we know that this histogram is not very useful for users who run their own instances. Therefore, we want to update the feature flag to better serve us.\n\n# Technical details\n\n- [ ] Change the `ci_pipeline_creation_step_duration_tracking` feature flag type to `ops`\n- [ ] Update the

Scheduled scan\n  description: description\n  enabled: true\n  rules:\n  - type: schedule\n    branches:\n    - master\n    - feature-a\n    cadence: */30 * * * *\n  actions:\n  - scan: dast\n    scanner_profile: Scanner Profile A\n    site_profile: Site Profile B\n  - scan: secret_detection\n```\n\nThere will be 4 pipelines created: `secret_detection` for branch `master` and `feature-a` and `dast` for branch `master` and `feature-a`.\n\n![Screenshot_2021-08-25_at_7.14.54_PM](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/uploads/98211ba6d6b531ffbe5b88daf5112b65/Screenshot_2021-08-25_at_7.14.54_PM.png)\n\nThe reason why we cannot create both `secret_detection` and `dast` on the same pipeline was because we re-use the code from [On Demand DAST scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#on-demand-scans) and the pipeline source will be `ondemand_dast_scan` and for `secret_detection` the source will be `security_orchestration_policy`.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [ ] It is desired to have all the jobs for a branch to be executed in a single pipeline instead of multiple pipeline\n- [ ] `dast` scan should be executed in the pipeline with source `security_orchestration_policy`\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] ~backend Move the logic of creating a pipeline for each scan in [`Security::SecurityOrchestrationPolicies::RuleScheduleService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/394a3e49/ee/app/services/security/security_orchestration_policies/rule_schedule_service.rb) to [`Security::SecurityOrchestrationPolicies::CreatePipelineService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/394a3e49/ee/app/services/security/security_orchestration_policies/create_pipeline_service.rb)\n- [ ] ~backend Use [`AppSec::Dast::ScanConfigs::BuildService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1db05df7/ee/app/services/app_sec/dast/scan_configs/build_service.rb) to create pipeline configuration for `dast` scan and set `pipeline.dast_profile = dast_profile` similar to [`Ci::RunDastScanService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/1db05df7/ee/app/services/ci/run_dast_scan_service.rb)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-26T03:55:09.608Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T18:54:12.913Z","closed_at":"2022-11-08T17:01:12.003Z","closed_by":{"id":8401507,"username":"sashi_kumar","name":"Sashi

Plan\n\n* Run `jest --findrelatedTests` on MRs that contain backend changes\n* Incremental benefits:\n  * shorter backend pipelines as only jest tests that depend on affected fixtures are run\n\n### Overview\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph frontend\n    fe[\"FE code\"]--jest --findRelatedTests--\u003ejest\n    end\n    subgraph backend\n    be[\"BE code\"]--crystalball--\u003erspec\n    end\n    \n    be--?--\u003efixtures\n    fixtures--jest --findRelatedTests--\u003ejest\n```\n\nThe diagram above illustrates the test dependency between frontend and backend code and the respective tests. `?` denotes the missing link needed in order to run related jest tests based on a backend change.\n\nSome jest tests load the fixtures as dependency. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339346, we have made it possible for jest to track the fixture dependency of the tests, so jest is able to run the relevant tests for each fixture file.\n\nThe next step from here is to identify which fixture file is affected by the backend change, so that when a backend file changes, we can feed `jest --findRelatedTests` with the fixture that was affected.\n\n### How it works?\n\nA fixture rspec file generates a fixture file per example, based on the test description. For example, the following fixture rspec file\n\n```rb\n# spec/frontend/fixtures/pipelines.rb\n  it 'pipelines/pipelines.json' do\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  it \"pipelines/test_report.json\" do\n    # ...\n  end\n```\n\ngenerates the following test fixtures:\n\n```\ntmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/pipelines.json\ntmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/test_report.json\n```\n\nThe work in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339346 allows us to find the test files that uses this fixture:\n\n```shell\n$ jest --config jest.config.js --listTests --findRelatedTests tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/pipelines.json tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/test_report.json\n\nee/spec/frontend/pipelines/pipelines_table_spec.js\nspec/frontend/pipelines/pipelines_spec.js\n...\n```\n\n### What is needed?\n\nTo make the link between ruby code and the fixture file, we need the following:\n\n1. A mapping from the source code to the fixture rspec file, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"app/controllers/projects/pipelines_controller.rb\": [\"spec/frontend/fixtures/pipelines.rb\"]\n}\n```\n\n2. A mapping of a fixture rspec file to the fixture file itself, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"spec/frontend/fixtures/pipelines.rb\": [\n    \"tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/pipelines.json\",\n    \"tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/test_report.json\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWith these mappings, we could derive the fixture files that might be affected, then pass them on to jest.\n\nGiven a change in `app/controllers/projects/pipelines_controller.rb`, `spec/frontend/fixtures/pipelines.rb` and therefore `tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/pipelines.json`, `tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/test_report.json` might also change. So we would need to run the following jest command:\n\n```shell\njest --findRelatedTests tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/pipelines.json tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/test_report.json\n```\n\nWhich would run the known jest tests that use the above fixtures:\n```\nee/spec/frontend/pipelines/pipelines_table_spec.js\nspec/frontend/pipelines/pipelines_spec.js\n...\n```\n\n### Implementation detail\n\nTo generate the fixture rspec mapping, we could use Crystalball to track the code executed by each fixture rspec file. This is similar to how we generate the mapping for other rspec files.\n- Crystalball execution tracking: http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/980005f6734277866ce4e266b356e5caf736ca5c/spec/crystalball_env.rb#L8-8\n- Generating source -\u003e test mapping from Crystalball: http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/980005f6734277866ce4e266b356e5caf736ca5c/tooling/lib/tooling/test_map_generator.rb#L7-7\n\nIn addition, we need to map the fixture rspec file to the generated test fixture file. To do this, we need to hook into the rspec example execution and store the path of the generated file. We might be able to extract information from the [helper](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/980005f6734277866ce4e266b356e5caf736ca5c/spec/support/helpers/javascript_fixtures_helpers.rb#L57-57) for this purpose.\n\nCombining the two, we could generate a map such as the following, which can be used to identify the fixtures that need to be passed to `jest`:\n```json\n{\n  \"app/controllers/projects/pipelines_controller.rb\": [\n    \"tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/pipelines.json\",\n    \"tmp/tests/frontend/fixtures-ee/pipelines/test_report.json\"\n  ]\n}\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-25T14:56:38.856Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T11:38:18.760Z","closed_at":"2021-11-30T14:45:55.464Z","closed_by":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","auto updated","ep::pipeline","maintenance::pipelines","missed:14.5","priority::2","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"}],"author":{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339343","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339343","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339343/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339343/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339343","relative":"#339343","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339343"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6608,"epic":{"id":332480,"iid":6608,"title":"Selective Tests Frontend: Jest optimizations","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6608","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92577381,"iid":339338,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `scan_result_policy`","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [scan result policy](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6237) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `scan_result_policy` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::container security\" ~\"secure merge request approval\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_protect_container_security`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @zmartins \n- PM: @sam.white \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with testing groups\n- Rollout on GitLab.com for a certain period (How long)\n- Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com\n- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

`/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run

Before that there is a risk that the legacy data contains notification levels updated while we weren't yet updating the new legacy columns due to some MRs from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290961 still being completed.\n\nAfter October 1st we should have all the values of legacy and new tracking synchronized and we can proceed with the FF rollout.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe reason why \n\nThis issue is to rollout on production the new mechanism that checks whether we need to send the email out to the customer when remaining CI minutes fall below certain thresholds (30%, 5%, 0%).\n\n- When the feature flag is disabled (current case) we use the legacy columns in `namespaces.last_ci_minutes_usage_notification_level` and `namespaces.last_ci_minutes_notification_at`.

This means that the notification level has been set correctly.\n- Ensure that `ci_namespace_monthly_usages.notification_level` matches the legacy columns in `namespaces` table.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-25T11:19:29.812Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T23:47:45.124Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T14:14:36.699Z","closed_by":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"labels":["CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","auto updated","backend","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline execution","missed:14.5","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"}],"author":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":695467,"username":"fabiopitino","name":"Fabio Pitino","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0db032076c54065b10b3efdfd175e6c?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fabiopitino"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339324","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339324","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339324/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339324/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339324","relative":"#339324","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339324"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4840,"epic":{"id":140298,"iid":4840,"title":"Deprecate CI minutes reset jobs in favour of tracking historical usage data","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4840","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92557527,"iid":339320,"project_id":278964,"title":"Check if value in CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE is valid","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nAs a part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5577 `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` will be introduced to de-duplicate findings.

These are allowlisted by allowing the specs that produce them, the list is in [spec/support/database/cross-join-allowlist.yml](spec/support/database/cross-join-allowlist.yml).\n\nIn some cases, the spec allowlist is probably too broad so we switch to using an alternative allowlist method using `allow_cross_joins_across_databases`. This also allows us to annotate with the issue link where we will be fixing the cross-database query.\n\n## Problem\n\nThere are 418 specs allowlisted which means there are at least that many cross-database queries. Potentially, there are no issues opened for these queries, though a majority should have already been discovered from the PoC MR.\n\nEven so, the more `allow_cross_joins_across_databases` places we can add, the less we need to rely on the PoC MR (and stop needing to rebase the PoC MR every so often, which is painful)\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Gather all candidate call sites - DONE using https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69037\n1. Open relevant issues, and also add `allow_cross_joins_across_databases` where possible. (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337077) - DONE\n1. Add `::Gitlab::Database.allow_cross_joins_across_databases` to the offending call sites. - DONE\n1. Write a way to automatically regenerate the `.cross-join-allowlist.yml` allowlist so that we can shrink this over time. - IN PROGRESS We can use https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69037 for now\n\n\n## New issues opened\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339429\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339621\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339937\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340188\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343301\n\n#### Existing issue linked\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338659\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336891\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335946\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336436\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341796\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336433\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338658","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-25T05:19:27.711Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T08:49:59.565Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T21:24:42.811Z","closed_by":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"labels":["Category:Pods","devops::systems","missed:14.3","missed:14.4","section::enablement","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"}],"author":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2535118,"username":"tkuah","name":"Thong Kuah","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b51bdd49a4914d29504d7ff4c3f7b9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tkuah"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339299","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339299","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339299/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339299/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339299","relative":"#339299","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339299"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6168,"epic":{"id":287568,"iid":6168,"title":"Decompose GitLab.com's database to improve scalability","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6168","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92530960,"iid":339284,"project_id":278964,"title":"Follow-up from \"Add ability to easily sanitize attributes\"","description":"The following discussion from !68442 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @djadmin started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68442#note_659080709):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **Questions (non-blocking):**\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-24T08:06:30.503Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T12:01:25.092Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T14:42:44.822Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["Deliverable","auto updated","devops::create","feature","feature flag","frontend","group::code review","missed-deliverable","missed:14.10","missed:14.8","missed:15.0","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":41,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339181","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":47,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 47 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339181","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339181/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339181/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339181","relative":"#339181","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339181"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5589,"epic":{"id":224926,"iid":5589,"title":"Restructure MR merge widget","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5589","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92454915,"iid":339148,"project_id":278964,"title":"Service desk setting relation is marked to be exported only on EE","description":"We moved service desk feature to CE, but `service_desk_setting` relation is marked to be exported  \nonly on EE version, check https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/project/import_export.yml#L457.   \n\nWe should move the relation to be exported on CE.  \n\nAlso, check if `file_from_project_id,` added on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67546 field can be allow listed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-23T18:51:18.781Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T00:33:13.529Z","closed_at":"2021-08-30T21:08:20.278Z","closed_by":{"id":1933526,"username":"leetickett","name":"Lee Tickett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1933526/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/leetickett"},"labels":["Category:Service Desk","backend","devops::plan","feature::addition","group::respond","section::dev","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Those tags take physical space on object storage.\n\nTo counter that, we implemented [cleanup policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/#cleanup-policy). Basically, users will create a set of filters that will allow the backend to distinguish between a tag that needs to be kept and a tag that can be destroyed.\n\nCleanup policies are executed by background jobs periodically. There is a cadence value that users can set but to keep simple, let's say that ~backend will run the policies daily.\n\nNow, container image tags don't live in the rails backend ~database. Those objects live directly in the container registry. So, when the ~backend runs a policy against a container image, it has to contact the container registry (through an API) and get all the information/data about tags.\n\nLet's detail, these interactions (simplified)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    autonumber\n    rails cleanup tags service-\u003e\u003erails cleanup tags service: Run the cleanup policy on this container image X\n    rails cleanup tags service-\u003e\u003econtainer registry: Give me all the tags of container image X\n    container registry-\u003e\u003erails cleanup tags service: Array of tag names\n    rails cleanup tags service-\u003e\u003erails cleanup tags service: Apply filters F1 on the array of tag names\n    loop **For each tag name**\n      rails cleanup tags service-\u003e\u003econtainer registry: get the created at timestamp\n      container registry-\u003e\u003erails cleanup tags service: return the created at timestamp\n    end\n    rails cleanup tags service-\u003e\u003erails cleanup tags service: Apply filters F2 on tags with created at\n    rails cleanup tags service-\u003e\u003erails delete tags service: hey delete these tags!\n    rails delete tags service-\u003e\u003erails cleanup tags service: ok\n```\n\n* F1: this set of filters is set on the tag names (such as a regex)\n* F2: these need the `created_at` as they are filters that need to work on the tag list ordered by `created_at`\n\nYou can see in the interactions above that `F2` triggers a loop where the ~backend will trigger one API call per tag to get the `created_at` of a given tag. Please understand, that these are the constraints we need to work with. At some point, container registry updates will unlock evolutions such as returning the list of tags with their name _and_ their `created_at` field in a single API call. Until we have those updates, we need to work with two API endpoints: one to get the list of tags (only names) and one to get the `created_at` of a tag.\n\nTo complete this context, understand that container image tags are mutable. Users can delete them and make them point to a different image. The constraint here is that they do this by interacting directly with the container registry. As such, the rails ~backend has no clue of what happened with a tag.\n\n## :boom: Problem\n\nThe main issue is that F2 removes so many tags that the resulting list of tags (eg. list of tags to destroy) is empty.\n\nSee this [Kibana dashboard](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/e4f324ada962811b32178cc99e878e4c). We're not going into the details of that dashboard but look at how much `Deleting tags` we have. The related ratio with that section is super small. In other words, in the majority of the jobs execution, we do all these API calls to the container registry for..... :drum: .... nothing (empty list of tags to destroy).\n\nThis is not efficient at all.\n\n[Here](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/ccc215af3598ec70a6bcfd3efb0ae158) is the p95 of `external_http_count` of the last 24 hours for jobs that didn't destroy any tag.\n\n## :hammer: Solution\n\nThe proposed solution here aims to reduce the loop of pings to get `created_at`s. This will make the background job more efficient and so the ~backend will make a better use of its background resources.\n\nThe idea is to have a cache for some tags (not all of them). We need to be extra cautious with what we cache because as presented in the context, tags are mutable objects and the rails ~backend is not notified when a tag is \"updated\". In other words, caching a tag can be dangerous because we easily have stale data in cache.\n\nLet's see if we can workaround those limitations. Here are the updated steps around F2 in the `cleanup_tags_service.rb`:\n1. Receives the result of F1 (array of tag names)\n1. Read the `older_than` parameter from the cleanup policy\n1. Remove from the cache, all entries older than `older_than`\n1. For each tag, check the cache and fill the `created_at`\n1. For each tag without the `created_at`, ping the container registry\n1. Apply F2 filters\n1. For each tag _**filtered out**_, create a new cache entry for the tag with their `created_at` if a cache entry doesn't exist\n\nI will emphasize here that cache entries are only created for tags that are kept or filtered out by F2. Why? Because, there is no sense in creating a cache entry for a tag that is going to be destroyed.\n\nA few things to note:\n* Cache entries have a TTL. I choose to use the cleanup policy `older_than` parameter but we could chose something shorter such as `older_than` / 2.\n* The job itself will not evict cache entries\n* Optional: the job could log the cache hit ratio\n\nWhy this custom cache logic works with the mutable nature of tags. Because, we snapshot the `created_at` field for tags that we want to keep and when it's time to destroy the tag, we don't destroy the tag itself but the cache entry. This is to \"force\" the job to ping the container registry to get the latest `created_at` = the job destroys tags with information that comes *only* from the container registry.\n\nBy avoiding using the stale data, the job will support any tag mutation. Here is an example (assuming `older_than` = 90 days): \n\n* `T`: the tag `t` is created.\n* `T + 1.day`: the job runs and caches `T` for tag `t`.\n* `T + 10.days`: the tag is destroyed.\n* `T + 20.days`: the tag is recreated (same name).\n* `T + 91.days`\n   * the job runs and remove the cache entry for `t` (T is older that `older_than`.).\n   * the job pings the container registry for `t` and receives `T + 20.days`.\n   * the job filter out `t` (`T + 20.days` is within `older_than`).\n   * the job creates a new cache entry with `T + 20.days` for tag `t`.\n\nThe tag mutation didn't lead the job to a wrong decision. The cache was properly updated with the new `created_at`.\n\n### :bulb: Technical details ideas\n\nThe cache itself can be implemented in two ways:\n* redis\n* regular database table\n\nIt has to support the following operations:\n1. Create an entry with: container image id, tag name, `created_at`\n1. Get the entry for a given container image id and tag name\n1. Given a container image id, remove all the cache entries where `created_at` is \u003c `Time.now - policy.older_than`\n\nHere are some numbers from ~\"gitlab.com\":\n* ~50K container images are processed by cleanup policies\n   * keep in mind that we're rolling out the cleanup policies for all projects and this number will only increase\n* before applying F1, we truncate the list of tags to max 200\n* so, the worst case scenario will be handling 50K * 200 cache entries\n\nRedis feels better geared at this problem than a database. Operation (3.) can be implemented with a TTL in the redis key directly = the job doesn't have to evict the cache entries, redis will do automatically that for us.\n\nThe amount of data to be cached can be a concern. As such, I would suggest using a ~\"feature flag\" to \"mark\" projects (or namespaces) that can use this cache feature.\n\n### :gear: Implementation\n\nFollowing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339129#note_660056458, redis is a better candidate for what we want to do.\n\n* Step (3.) There is no need for this step with redis. Using [SET](https://redis.io/commands/set), we can set an expiration time. In other words, redis itself will handle this part for us.\n* Step (4.) To get the value from the cache, we can use [GET](https://redis.io/commands/get). Nothing special here.\n* Step (7.) To set a value, we can use [SET](https://redis.io/commands/set) as described above.\n   * Regarding the TTL, it should be `created_at + older_than`\n\nThe key for [SET](https://redis.io/commands/set) and [GET](https://redis.io/commands/get) should be: `container_repository:{\u003cid\u003e}:cleanup_tag:\u003ctag name\u003e`. The container image id and the tag name **must be** part of the key. The value is, well, the `created_at` value :smiley_cat: \n\n:warning: Gotchas\n* Avoid n+1 redis operations since we're looping on a list of tags.\n   * For this use [redis pipelines](https://redis.io/topics/pipelining).","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-23T15:37:45.709Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T12:34:45.401Z","closed_at":"2021-10-12T15:17:58.879Z","closed_by":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Category:Package Registry","auto updated","backend","bug::performance","devops::package","group::package registry","package:active","package:scaling","ruby","section::ops","workflow::staging"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339129","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339129","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339129/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339129/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339129","relative":"#339129","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339129"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92440694,"iid":339125,"project_id":278964,"title":"Artifacts dropdown shows `No artifacts found` while loading artifacts","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen clicking on the artifacts dropdown on the pipelines table, the dropdown shows `No artifacts found` even when the artifacts are still loading.

This term has already been updated to `Tool` on the Pipeline Vulnerability Report as well as all other Vulnerability Reports \u0026 the Vulnerability Details page. \n\nThe \"Scan Type\" should be our categories such as `sast` or `dependency scanning` where-as the \"Scanner\" refers to the underlying tool reporting the findings; i.e. `gosec` or `gemnasium`. This can be confusing and is incongruent with the vulnerability details page, where we list the scanner correctly (see screenshot below)\n\nSee Secure Glossary MR for more on the distinction: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/49901/diffs\n\nAdditionally, there will be future sources of vulnerability data that does not come from a scanner/pipeline job. For example, we will soon have the ability to add vulnerability objects by manually creating them or doing so directly via API. This adds further weight to `Scanner` being an inappropriate name for the vulnerability source. To be more clear and more inclusive, we will instead rename this column to `Tool`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Visit https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports/-/merge_requests/60\n* Expand the MR Security Widget \u0026 select any finding \n* Observe the datapoint `Scanner`, this should read `Tool` \n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports/-/merge_requests/60\n\n### What is the current behavior?\n\nWe display the \"Scan Type\" under the heading of \"Scanner\"\n\n### What is the desired behavior?\n\nWe display the report type data with the updated heading of \"Tool\"\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/c7d42ca5ba71efe47ed5b43b388dcf8b/image.png)\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [ ] TBD\n- [ ] Update documentation screenshots and references for the Pipeline Security Report modal.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-20T18:40:17.114Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T17:12:24.382Z","closed_at":"2021-08-23T17:12:24.359Z","closed_by":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"labels":["Category:Vulnerability Management","UX","devops::secure","documentation","feature::enhancement","frontend","good for new contributors","group::threat insights","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"}],"author":{"id":4906978,"username":"lkerr","name":"Lindsay Kerr","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4906978/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lkerr"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4155411,"username":"dpisek","name":"David Pisek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4155411/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dpisek"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339046","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339046","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339046/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339046/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339046","relative":"#339046","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339046"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92344567,"iid":339039,"project_id":278964,"title":"[External Status Checks] Replace \"approved\" with \"passed\" in API responses","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nExternal Status Checks briefly used the term \"approved\" before we [changed to use the term \"passed\"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68491).

Security Configuration page backend between EE and CE","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nThe Security Configuration page needs to show different information depending on the tier the given project is in. Currently, the logic of that behaviour is scattered in various places on the frontend and backend, which makes adding features or moving features to different tiers difficult and error-prone.\n\nFor instance, there's a [check in the `EE::Projects::Security::ConfigurationController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/31da8512f850a3ccf19736ea1b02f932252b1ae6/ee/app/controllers/ee/projects/security/configuration_controller.rb#L35) that's a _proxy_ for \"are we in Ultimate?\", and delegates to the CE controller in the negative case. [_That_ controller](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/31da8512f850a3ccf19736ea1b02f932252b1ae6/app/controllers/projects/security/configuration_controller.rb) passes basically no information to the frontend (there's no [`ConfigurationPresenter`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/31da8512f850a3ccf19736ea1b02f932252b1ae6/ee/app/presenters/projects/security/configuration_presenter.rb) instance exposed), and so the frontend has to [branch on that](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/31da8512f850a3ccf19736ea1b02f932252b1ae6/ee/app/views/projects/security/configuration/show.html.haml#L6), and [hard-code some information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/31da8512f850a3ccf19736ea1b02f932252b1ae6/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/components/constants.js#L249-257) and have [some awkward type checks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/31da8512f850a3ccf19736ea1b02f932252b1ae6/app/assets/javascripts/security_configuration/components/feature_card.vue#L28).\n\nInstead, it would be better if the `Security::ConfigurationController` _always_ presented the same structured information to the frontend. Then, the frontend could be simplified to render the information it's given, rather than making decisions itself about what to do given the _lack_ of data. Modifications to the frontend are covered by #333113.\n\n**In short, this would make adding to and modifying the Security Configuration page much simpler and faster.**\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- [Design issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326926)\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nPrerequisite work is done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342135\n\n- [x] Create **feature flag** `unify_security_configuration`\n- [x] in EE `ConfigurationController`, `ConfigurationPresenter` accepts attribute for auto-fix permissions: move it to a separate method:\n  ```ruby\n    @configuration = ::Projects::Security::ConfigurationPresenter.new(project,\n                                                                            presenter_attributes,\n                                                                            current_user: current_user)\n\n    # ...\n    def presenter_attributes\n      { auto_fix_permission: auto_fix_authorized? }\n    end\n  ```\n- [x] in FOSS `ConfigurationController` create private `presenter_attributes` that return empty hash\n- [ ] Remove `show` method from EE `ConfigurationPresenter` and move its content to `show` method of FOSS `ConfigurationPresenter`.\n- [x] in FOSS `ConfigurationController` create a condition by which instance of `ConfigurationPresenter` is returned if if feature flag is enabled or GitLab tier is Ultimate.

List dependencies using the [Dependencies API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dependencies.html), and include any of the aforementioned values in the `package_manager` param\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/scala-sbt-multiproject/\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API returns a validation error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"package_manager does not have a valid value\"\n}\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe API properly filters out the dependencies that match the `package_manager` param.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nAdding missing values to `FILTER_PACKAGE_MANAGERS_VALUES`, in [dependency_list_service.rb](ee/app/services/security/dependency_list_service.rb#L7).\n\nAlternatively, we could change the API endpoint to remove the check on `package_manager`, for ease of maintenance.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Adding missing values to `FILTER_PACKAGE_MANAGERS_VALUES`\n\n/cc @NicoleSchwartz @gonzoyumo","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-20T11:34:52.359Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T08:55:29.937Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T09:08:12.152Z","closed_by":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","priority::3","section::sec","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"}],"author":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1958785,"username":"fcatteau","name":"Fabien Catteau","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1958785/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fcatteau"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339012","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339012","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339012/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/339012/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#339012","relative":"#339012","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#339012"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":92299932,"iid":338985,"project_id":278964,"title":"Enable Group Migration feature flag by default","description":"### Proposal\n\nWith the delivery of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4619, the migration for Groups is now a viable feature.

The users should know that they can use GitLab Migration to get the groups and Export/Import to get the projects (mix-and-match, in a way).\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/ac56411c9c0f538b6cbdfaa85460cf58/image.png)\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-19T23:27:07.147Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T21:17:03.763Z","closed_at":"2021-10-10T11:35:39.703Z","closed_by":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"labels":["Category:Importers","Importer:GitLab Migration","Next Up","UX","devops::manage","direction","documentation","estimation::completed","feature::enhancement","frontend","group::import","milestone::p2","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"}],"author":{"id":5247073,"username":"hdelalic","name":"Haris Delalić","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5247073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hdelalic"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1230286,"username":"xanf","name":"Illya Klymov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ce4d16557b46210fa57641531b570dd4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xanf"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338983","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338983","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338983/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338983/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338983","relative":"#338983","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338983"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4613,"epic":{"id":126554,"iid":4613,"title":"GitLab Migration - UX improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4613","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92299575,"iid":338980,"project_id":278964,"title":"Setting User Cap causes SAML user to be blocked during first sign in","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen SAML is appropriately configured on a self-managed GitLab instance, a new user can sign in with their SAML identity and have the account automatically created. If there are no \"block auto-created users\" settings enabled, the user can directly sign into GitLab on the first attempt.\n\nHowever, if the \"user cap\" setting is specified, the user is redirected to the sign in page and shown a \"blocked pending Approval\" message:\n![BlockedPendingApproval](/uploads/e46d72028925a7325c7d0b7c1ab0aad0/BlockedPendingApproval.png)\nThis happens even if the user cap is set to say 50 and the current number of users is 5.\n\nThe problem is that the user is not actually blocked - viewing the admin dashboard shows user has been created and is active.\nAlso, the user will be signed in if they immediately refresh the page.\n\nBased on my testing and research, I feel that this behaviour may be related to this commit: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/c312fd3ece6064cfbca6beb84aa3ba4f6baf983c\n\n**Note** The current workaround is to either remove User Cap settings (not great from a user management perspective) or ask all new users to try signing in again upon seeing that banner.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up SAML with GitLab SM.\n1. Sign in with new user\n   - User account is created and user is signed in without any issues\n1. Change User Cap settings in admin dashboard to some arbitrarily high number (say 100)\n1. Sign in with another new user\n   - User will be redirected back to sign in page with Blocked Pending Approval warning\n   - Simultaneously, on another browser, check admin dashboard - User is not blocked and is shown as active\n   - Also if user refreshes page, they will be signed in\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOn first sign-in via SAML, user is redirected to the sign-in page and shown a \"Blocked Pending Approval\" banner.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUser should be signed in.\nUser should not be redirected to the sign in page and should not see the Blocked banner.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n```\n==\u003e /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/application.log \u003c==\n2021-08-19T04:58:55.093Z: User \"alvinsaml\"

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338865#note_655312474, we identified the use of subtransactions can cause significant performance issues on PostgreSQL replicas at scale. If a long running transaction occurs, the subtransaction cache may not fit into the working set of memory, which can lead to a context switch storm when PostgreSQL needs to load subtransaction data from disk. While this arguably is a PostgreSQL bug, we should remove subtransactions entirely because they aren't performant at GitLab.com scale, nor are they strictly necessary.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [x] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [x] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [x] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

The problem endpoints are in the dependency proxy:\n\n* Groups::DependencyProxyForContainersController#blob\n* Groups::DependencyProxyForContainersController#manifest\n\n### Example Project\n\nExample project can be found on https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/230844\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe customer gets a 429 rate limit errors for unauthenticated requests when they are actually authenticated using CI/CD with dependency proxy and performing `docker pull` from a self-managed runner that is connected to GitLab.com \n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe customer should not get 429 rate limit errors when request are authenticated until they hit the [rate limit](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/230844) of 2000 request per minute\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n* https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CB3LSMEJV/p1629323305299800\n\u003e https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/5616be443f6ded2bb326b3922d79ae69 shows the Rack_Attack logs for the instance they reported from yesterday  (a little over 32 hours ago).  One key fact is that there is no username and json.matched is throttle_unauthenticated, so this was an unauth per-IP rate-limit against $REDACTED_IP\n\n\u003e And https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7088596e29af777ff2f1a9e330ae579c shows logs from that IP at that time, where we can see for 13:57 they did indeed exceed 500/min (the limit for unauth'd requests : https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/#gitlabcom-specific-rate-limits).BUT: if we look for access logs from that IP without a username (https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a42ae8238f545ad4668d3b94833a5621), we only find 6.  \n\n\u003e So: the requests were authenticated, but RackAttack thought they weren't.   We've seen this sort of behavior on other endpoints (back when we were enabling rate-limiting in the first place).  It is likely a bug/weirdness in the auth handling\n\n\n* https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/5616be443f6ded2bb326b3922d79ae69\n* https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7088596e29af777ff2f1a9e330ae579c\n* https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/a42ae8238f545ad4668d3b94833a5621\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/753\n  * Previous similar situation; same basic symptoms, suggests a path for investivgation\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\nGitLab 14.1\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-19T17:51:02.694Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T10:12:20.620Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T12:55:51.083Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Proxy","Deliverable","Package:P1","api","customer","devops::package","gitlab.com","group::package registry","group::scalability","section::ops","type::bug","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":6426278,"username":"mmora","name":"Mario Mora","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6426278/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mmora"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338925","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338925","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338925/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338925/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338925","relative":"#338925","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338925"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92287712,"iid":338923,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove Subtransactions in Event","description":"## Background\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338346#note_652623314 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338865#note_655312474, we identified the use of subtransactions can cause significant performance issues on PostgreSQL replicas at scale.

This would make it easier for people to migrate from their existing on-call schedule management to GitLab.\n\n### WIP Proposal\n\nIntroduce a separate workflow on the on-call schedule empty state that allows people to import a .csv or a .ics file. How this could work/look: \n\n| Introduce new option to import a schedule | Modal to select file | File selected | Schedule imported | Schedule import failed |\n| ------ | ------ |  ------ | ------ |  ------ |\n| ![On-call_schedules](/uploads/7fb2087f38af41360c44590849f10936/On-call_schedules.png) | ![Modal](/uploads/6bc722253006dd53ca7a6872fa0e2c96/Modal.png) | ![Modal-1](/uploads/8a15bca02f1df16749d9e59a5fe6219e/Modal-1.png) | ![Rotation_added](/uploads/641c673a0e842e1ddd069a2c735af053/Rotation_added.png) | ![On-call_schedules-1](/uploads/b26d75784f5774c713579102a1b49d23/On-call_schedules-1.png) |\n\n**Things we'll need engineering input on**\n- Since we separate out rotations/on-call schedules, can we actually get the information we need from a single file/import process? Or, would people need to import the schedule first, and then the rotation?\n- Would we be able to map usernames in an exported csv file to usernames in GitLab? If not, would we need an additional step in this process?\n- Can we support both csv and ics files out-of-the-box, or should we focus first on one or the other?\n\nDepending on the answers to these questions, it may or may not make sense to implement this feature. It could be that the work needed to make this possible is prohibitively high, and that this isn't a workflow we want to support. Will update this issue when we make a decision on this point.\n\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/9ZCGhybxbrnq19Sj5BsAZ2/Mobile-designs-on-call-schedules-gitlab-com-and-327021-Copy?node-id=593%3A32096)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-19T16:35:43.795Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T22:30:48.748Z","closed_at":"2021-10-20T16:22:59.759Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["Category:On-call Schedule Management","OKR","UX","UX scorecard-rec","devops::monitor","group::respond","learnability","section::ops","severity::4","type::feature","workflow::validation backlog"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"}],"author":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338911","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338911","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338911/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/338911/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#338911","relative":"#338911","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#338911"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6594,"epic":{"id":329831,"iid":6594,"title":"On-call schedule management usability improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6594","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92282712,"iid":338908,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `ci_create_external_pr_pipeline_async`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [moving the external pr pipeline creation to sidekiq](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336238) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_create_external_pr_pipeline_async` feature flag.\n\nIntroduced in: !68567\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline authoring\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-authoring`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @furkanayhan \n- PM: @dhershkovitch \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with testing groups\n- Rollout on GitLab.com for a certain period (How long)\n- Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com\n- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_create_external_pr_pipeline_async` feature flag.

We want to avoid duplicate findings for branches that are already present in default branch. In order to achieve it, a new [CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#available-variables) `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` will be used by the user to set the image which will be used to de-duplicate similar findings for the branch. The value set in this variable will be sent to GitLab Rails from [`gcs`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning) through the report JSON (`gl-container-scanning-report.json`).\n\nThis issue will address updating [`Gitlab::Ci::Parsers::Security::ContainerScanning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f38e31c9/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/container_scanning.rb) to read the `default_branch_image` value from `location` object in JSON report. [`Gitlab::Ci::Reports::Security::Locations::ContainerScanning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/f38e31c9/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/security/locations/container_scanning.rb) will be updated to use `default_branch_image` to fingerprint the location.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- The `default_branch_image` should be used to fingerprint the location only if the job runs for non-default branch pipeline. \n- For the initial iteration, we will not verify if `default_branch_image` is a valid image.\n- `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` value should not be changed once it is set, changing so would not work the way it is expected.\n\n[PoC MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/66267) could be used as a reference.\n\n## Relevant links\n- [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5577)\n- [Spike](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330641)\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n- [ ] Documentation:\n  - [ ] Add `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` to [doc/user/application_security/container_scanning/index.md](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/application_security/container_scanning/index.md#available-cicd-variables)\n  - [ ] Mention that the variable should not be updated once it is set. If it is changed the feature will not work as expected.\n  - [ ] Since the value set in `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` will not be validated, it should be mentioned that the user should follow a proper naming convention for `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` Preferable values are:\n    -
