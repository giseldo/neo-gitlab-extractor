In %14.3 we have introduced similar functionality, but for `clusters`. Customer will be able to schedule a security scan of running containers on selected time and select which namespace and resource names should be scanned. The policy will look like the following:\n\n```yml\nscan_execution_policy:\n  name: Run Cluster Image Scan\n  description: This policy enforces container scans against a production cluster on a daily basis.\n  enabled: true\n  rules:\n  - type: schedule\n    agents:\n      agent-name:\n        namespaces: []\n    cadence: 0 0 * * *\n  actions:\n  - scan: cluster_image_scanning\n```\n\n`namespaces` may optionally be provided in order to limit the scan to the given namespaces. If omitted, then all namespaces will be scanned.\n\n## Relevant links\n- [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3410)\n- [Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219173)\n\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [ ] Documentation: add documentation to `doc/user/application_security/policies/index.md` with information how to configure policy to enforce scan with agents, (revert https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91075)\n- [-] Feature flag: no feature flag is needed as this is something that users will optionally select by including the GitLab CI template\n- [-] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n  - Test if you can configure policy to run on clusters connected through Kubernetes agent,\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\nUse the GitOps module as an implementation reference.\n\n1. Add a `server` package to `internal/module/starboard_vulnerability` which implements a `GetSecurityPoliciesToSynchronize` rpc.\n   1. The server will poll the security policy API, checking for changes to the policies\n   1. If the server returns 404, then it should be assumed that security policies are not available, but polling should continue.\n   1. If there is an update available, send the new policies in the response to agentk (using new rpc objects in `internal/module/starboard_vulnerability/rpc`)\n1. In `internal/module/starboard_vulnerability/rpc`, create a `PoliciesToSyncronizeWatcher`, which receives a gRPC request and a callback function to call with the returned data\n   1. The watcher will use the auto-generated (via protobuf) gRPC client in order to poll KAS and send any received policies to the callback function\n1. In `internal/module/starboard_vulnerability/agent/module.go`, add a `loadSecurityPolicy` callback function which receives `*agentcfg.StarboardCF`.\n   1. When this function is called, the `workerHolder` will stop all workers and then create a new ones with the received configuration.\n1. In `internal/module/starboard_vulnerability/agent`, create a Syncronizer with a `run` method which receives new policies on a channel.\n   1. When new policies are received on the channel, check if they would change the configuration currently held by the worker.\n   1. If the configuration has changed, call the `loadSecurityPolicy` callback function.\n1. Create a new `securityPoliciesWorker`, which will be started alongside the existing worker. This worker will hold the `loadSecurityPolicy` callback as a struct field. **This worker should be started even when the agent's Starboard configuration is empty**. When this worker is run it will:\n   1. Create a new channel to send security policies on\n   1. Run the synchonizer, giving it the channel\n   1. Start the watcher, passing a callback function which will send policies on the channel\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-21T11:50:09.263Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T14:09:21.744Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T23:31:46.309Z","closed_by":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Category:Security Policy Management","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::govern","direction","group::security policies","missed-deliverable","missed:14.10","missed:15.2","missed:15.3","missed:15.4","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"}],"author":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"},"user_notes_count":73,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341358","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341358","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341358/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341358/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#341358","relative":"#341358","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#341358"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6771,"epic":{"id":351102,"iid":6771,"title":"Simplify Cluster Image Scanning Setup","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6771","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":94029415,"iid":341356,"project_id":278964,"title":"DAST On-Demand Scan - View Scans - Index page","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nThis tracks the creation of a new page for showing DAST scans.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297396#note_665578315\n\nThis is a global component so submitting page level errors with `createFlash` could be a bit confusing for end users.  We should handle the errors in the component itself rather than with `createFlash`\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd an error state in the vuex store and manage it in the ` ~/header_search/components/header_search_autocomplete_items.vue` with something like `GlAlert` rather than simply catching and firing a `createFlash`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-20T15:49:36.429Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T16:29:48.905Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T15:23:24.653Z","closed_by":{"id":10776513,"username":"tbulva","name":"Tomas

[x] Create a `gradle` integration test which demonstrates the described bug. This should probably be added to [`spec/integration/java/gradle_spec.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/license-finder/-/blob/b7352580ff345217768b8e4f19262f27a93cc102/spec/integration/java/gradle_spec.rb), but this needs to be confirmed.\n1. [x] Add a gradle init script to `license-finder` which can be executed at scan time to set the dependency configuration `runtimeClasspath` by default - this works for both `compile` and `implementation`\n1. [ ] ~~Additionally update the init script so that the dependency configuration can be supplied to the analyzer via environment variable.~~\n1. [x] Update the tests with cases applying the init script and configuring the `dependencyConfiguration` directive.\n\nTested init script which works:\n```bash\n./gradlew  --init-script init.gradle downloadLicenses\n```\n\n`init.gradle`:\n```gradle\ninitscript {\n  repositories {\n    maven {\n      url \"https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  dependencies {\n    classpath 'gradle.plugin.com.hierynomus.gradle.plugins:license-gradle-plugin:0.15.0'\n  }\n}\n\nallprojects {\n  apply plugin: \"java\"\n  apply plugin: com.hierynomus.gradle.license.LicenseReportingPlugin\n  downloadLicenses {\n    dependencyConfiguration = 'runtimeClasspath'\n  }\n\n}\n``` \n\nGenerated licenses are in `build/reports/license`.\n\n### User experience goal\n\nCurrent license scanning limitation is resolved _or_ documented.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis will solve issues such as the one described in [License Scanning reports no license for some complex Gradle projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322127)\n\n### What does success look like?\n\nLicense scanning should be able to display licenses for packages defined using an `implementation` directive, _or_ this shortcoming should be documented with a workaround provided.\n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\n~\"GitLab Ultimate\" ~\"Enterprise Edition\" \n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nNo, this only affects ~\"Category:License Compliance\" \n\n/cc @gonzoyumo @NicoleSchwartz","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-20T08:20:48.806Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T09:26:50.814Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T21:45:03.638Z","closed_by":{"id":11279441,"username":"hacks4oats","name":"Oscar Tovar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11279441/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hacks4oats"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","approaching-SLO","backend","customer","devops::secure","group::composition analysis","missed-SLO","missed-deliverable","missed:14.3","missed:15.1","missed:15.2","priority::2","release post item","reproduced on GitLab.com","section::sec","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":11279441,"username":"hacks4oats","name":"Oscar Tovar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11279441/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hacks4oats"}],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11279441,"username":"hacks4oats","name":"Oscar Tovar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11279441/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hacks4oats"},"user_notes_count":37,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341222","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":3},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341222","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341222/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341222/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#341222","relative":"#341222","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#341222"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":93944728,"iid":341214,"project_id":278964,"title":"Missing warnings that GPG keys are exposing users verified email","description":"**[HackerOne report #1335671](https://hackerone.com/reports/1335671)** by `joaxcar` on 2021-09-10, assigned to @ngeorge1:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nThis might not be that much of an implementation problem rather than a documentation problem. The documentation for creating and using GPG keys for verifying commits fail to mention that any email used in a GPG will be publicly available (even for public users that does not have an account on the instance). The [documentation for GPG keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/) on GitLab mentions that you have to use a verified email from your account:\n\n\u003e One of the emails in the GPG key must match a verified email address used by the committer in GitLab. \n\n![gitlab.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/3c8cb2b8-0e79-4d15-8da2-e1646d9b71ea/gitlab.png)\n\nand\n\n\u003e Enter your real name, the email   \naddress to be associated with this key (should match a verified email address you use in GitLab) and an optional comment\n\nThe site does not contain any warning that the public GPG key will expose this email. As a reference, GitHub has a note:\n\n\u003e To keep your email address private, use your GitHub-provided no-reply email address. For more information, see \"Verifying your email address\" and \"Setting your commit email address.\"\n\n![github.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4a323ae5-0ef3-4e5a-bffc-0d1ac08c7595/github.png)\n\nThis kind of warning should be present in GitLab as well. As GitLab actually provides a \"private\" no-reply email for all users (see [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/#use-an-automatically-generated-private-commit-email)) which does count as a verified email, this should be mentioned in the GPG instructions.\n\nThe problem is that public GPG keys contain the linked email address. And as this email is enforced to be a verified email on the user account, the risk is that a user adds its primary email without realizing that this will now be exposed publicly even for unauthenticated visitors. If a user is only contributing verified commits in a private project the user might use a regular email as the commits would be out of reach for non-members of the project. The GPG key is still displayed on the user's profile page for everyone to see.\n\nAs mentioned, this is how GPG works, so it's up to the users to decide if they want to expose their email. But the information should be clearly mentioned in the documentation. As the key is visible by unauthenticated visitors to the instance even if registration is restricted.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Log in as a user \"user01\"  \n2. Add a GPG key following this guide: [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/#generating-a-gpg-key)  \n3. Log out of gitlab  \n4. Go to https://gitlab.domain.com/user01.gpg  \n5. Save the key in a file on your local machine  \n6. Run this command in a terminal  \n```  \ngpg --list-packets \u003cFILE_PATH\u003e | grep '@'  \n```  \nThe email will be shown in the terminal\n\n#####  Impact\n\nUsers might accidentally revel their verified emails through public GPG keys\n\n#####  Examples\n\nTest on my account key https://gitlab.com/joaxcar-test03.gpg\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThere is no warnings about GPG keys reveling verified emails\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe documentation should mention that adding a GPG key will break the privacy of the email used\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nMissing warnings could lead to users accidentally reveling their verified emails through public GPG keys\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [gitlab.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/3c8cb2b8-0e79-4d15-8da2-e1646d9b71ea/gitlab.png)\n* [github.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4a323ae5-0ef3-4e5a-bffc-0d1ac08c7595/github.png)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-20T05:59:06.200Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T12:57:36.824Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T16:48:51.181Z","closed_by":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-200","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::create","documentation","group::source code","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::4","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":40375,"username":"kerrizor","name":"Kerri Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/40375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kerrizor"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-12-19","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341214","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341214","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341214/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341214/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#341214","relative":"#341214","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#341214"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93941623,"iid":341213,"project_id":278964,"title":"VSA JS Error`cannot read suggestionsListClass of undefined `","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\n\nWhile validating https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340276 on ~\"workflow::staging\", I noticed a JS console error, this is confirmed on master as well, while it doesnt affect usage of the page, it would be good to fix this error.\n\nIt looks like this is an instance of this [known issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/troubleshooting#using-vue-component-issues).

If the target group namespace already exist, the import will start and complete successfully but if the user who import the project try to access the namespace, it will result in a 404 because the target namespace has already been taken and owned by other users on the target instance.  \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Have a group in a Self-Managed GitLab instance (`kebab` in the screenshot`)\n1. Try to import the group onto a different instance using a different name or the same name that's already being used (`totallyprivate` in the screenshot)\n1. Observe that the import process has a green ticket which give the impression that the import was successfully complete\n1. Try to navigate to the target group and see the 404\n\nsource group is owned by userA while the target group is owned by userB\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.

the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nActionable buttons(re-deploy \u0026 rollback) are missing from [Projects::EnvironmentsController:show](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v14.2.4-ee/app/controllers/projects/environments_controller.rb#L74-76)(**Deployments \u003e Environments \u003e Environment**) page for protected environments when accessed as users with [deployment-only access](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#deployment-only-access-to-protected-environments).\n\nButtons are missing from the `grouped` environments view as well(**Deployments \u003e Environments \u003e group folder \u003e 'Show all'**). Example URL: `https://gitlab.example.com/project/environments/-/environments/folders/review`\n\nAs a work-around, deployment-only users can use any of the following pages:\n\n- Job page.\n- [Environments index](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/v14.2.4-ee/app/controllers/projects/environments_controller.rb#L31)(**Deployments \u003e Environments**) page.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Set up [Deployment-only access to protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#deployment-only-access-to-protected-environments) for a user to a protected environment.\n- Run a deployment as any user.\n- Try accessing the `show` page(**Deployments \u003e Environments \u003e Environment**) of the above environment as the above user. It will not show re-deploy button.\n- Try accessing the same page as a maintainer user, it will show the available buttons(re-deploy or rollback).\n\nTo reproduce this for grouped view,\n\n- Run two deployments with environment names `test-folder/env1` and `test-folder/env2`.\n- Now go to **Deployments \u003e Environments \u003e test-folder \u003e 'Show all'**\n- You'll find the re-deployment button missing if the view is accessed as deployment-only user. Button shows correctly for maintainer users.\n\nI feel this is a ~bug , but I'll leave it to the product team to decide whether this request should be treated as a ~feature proposal.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n#### Describe what actually happens:\n\nDeployment buttons are missing when accessing the environment page and grouped environments page as deployment-only users. \n\n#### Describe what you should see instead:\n\nDeployment buttons should show up when accessing the environment page and grouped environments page as deployment-only users.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs -

Thank you to the assistance of community contributors @rpandini_wh and @gliDom. If you are using the latest, or latest major(2), the container you do not need to do anything to receive this update. If you have pinned your container to a minor or specific version please update to at least 2.26.0 receive this update.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nDependency Scanning currently supports Java up to version 16. Version 17 made it to general availability [recently](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-17-2021-09-14/) (2021-09-14) and should be supported as well.\n\n### Related details\n\nSee [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/157/diffs#note_824274749) for more details.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd Java 17 support for Dependency Scanning, without introducing any breaking changes.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. [x] Update [.tool-versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/cfa64550757f3626983c4b752d192fce32bb12f6/config/.tool-versions#L5) in `gemnasium-maven` and add `gradle 7.3.3`, keeping gradle `6.7.1` as the default (the first listed version is the default):\n\n   ```diff\n   - gradle 6.7.1\n   + gradle 6.7.1 7.3.3\n   ```\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/164\n\n1. [x] Update [.tool-versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/cfa64550757f3626983c4b752d192fce32bb12f6/config/.tool-versions#L2) in `gemnasium-maven` and add `adoptopenjdk-17.0.2+8` to the list of Java versions:\n\n   ```diff\n   - java adoptopenjdk-11.0.7+10.1 adoptopenjdk-8.0.252+9.1 adoptopenjdk-13.0.2+8.1 adoptopenjdk-14.0.1+7.1 adoptopenjdk-15.0.2+7 adoptopenjdk-16.0.0+36\n   + java adoptopenjdk-11.0.7+10.1 adoptopenjdk-8.0.252+9.1 adoptopenjdk-13.0.2+8.1 adoptopenjdk-14.0.1+7.1 adoptopenjdk-15.0.2+7 adoptopenjdk-16.0.0+36 adoptopenjdk-17.0.2+8\n   ```\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/164\n\n1. [x] Update [analyzer-wrapper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/cfa64550757f3626983c4b752d192fce32bb12f6/analyzer-wrapper#L31) so that if a user configures `DS_JAVA_VERSION=17`, we automatically select `gradle 7.3.3`\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/164\n\n1. [x] Update [`utils/gradle-plugin-builder/build.gradle`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/cfa64550757f3626983c4b752d192fce32bb12f6/utils/gradle-plugin-builder/build.gradle#L5) to use `gradle 7` syntax:\n\n   ```diff\n   - runtime group: 'com.gemnasium', name: 'gradle-plugin', version: '0.3.5'\n   + runtimeOnly group: 'com.gemnasium', name: 'gradle-plugin', version: '0.3.5'\n   ```\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/164\n\n1. [x] Add the following downstream QA tests to the [java-gradle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle) test project:\n\n   - [x] Test against a `Java 17` project without a `gradlew` file and show that it automatically siwtches to the pre-installed `gradle 7.3.3`\n\n      https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle/-/jobs/2160792124\n\n      ```shell\n      Using java version 'adoptopenjdk-17.0.2+8'\n      Using gradle version '7.3.3'\n      ```      \n\n   - [x] Test against an older Java version, such as `Java 14`, and show:\n      - [x] if no `gradlew` file is provided, `gradle 6.7.1` will be used\n\n         https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/167\n\n      - [x] if a `gradlew` file is provided that contains Gradle version `7.3`, the tests still pass\n\n         https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle/-/jobs/2160792098\n\n         ```shell\n         Using java version 'adoptopenjdk-14.0.1+7.1'\n         Welcome to Gradle 7.3!\n         Job succeeded\n         ```\n\n   It's important to add tests for projects that don't have a `gradlew` wrapper file with a pinned version of gradle. This shows that a `Java 17` project uses `gradle 7.3.3`, and a `Java 14` project uses `gradle 6.7.1`.\n\n   If we were to use a pinned version of gradle in a `gradlew` file, then it wouldn't show us that the version of gradle changes programmatically based on the version of Java, which is what we need to demonstrate.\n\n   See [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/157) for a starting point.\n\n1.

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nOur current CSV exports of vulnerability reports do not include any comment history. This makes is more challenging to know why a given vulnerability was closed or follow its activity history. Having the comments available helps with review and audit purposes—especially for security teams that might not be working in GitLab yet. Having the comments is also very important in the US Federal government space as they often require the reason why a vulnerability was Resolved or Dismissed.\n\n### Proposal \n\nAdd to the CSV export a new `Comments` column. Vulnerabilities can have multiple comments, each associated with a different status change. We want to capture the full comment history as a vulnerability may have moved back and forth between statuses.\n\nIt will be somewhat awkward to serialize multiple comments into a single field in a row. To help keep the comments distinguishable, each should include:\n\n* Comment author\n* Comment timestamp\n* Status associated with comment\n* Comment\n\nThis might take a form similar to: \"2022-09-28 01:02:03UTC::Author Name::Dismissed::Here is the Comment\". Each comment information set will need a delimiter (not necessarily `::`) to separate these pieces of data. Multiple comments will also need another delimiter that is separate from the field delimiter and this new data delimiter. Comments might contain the field or new data delimiter or new comment delimiter so they should be sanitized, wrapped in double quotes, or any conflicting characters escaped to prevent accident delimiter confusion.\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [ ] Add a new mapping (for example `'Comments' =\u003e 'notes_summary'`) into the [existing structure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d9157918065904b61c136d395f450f96fb5a72fe/ee/app/services/vulnerability_exports/exporters/csv_service.rb#L8).\n- [ ] Add a new method to return either the user that has edited notes or the author in case the note hasn't been edited as part of [note.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/note.rb).\n- [ ] In [Vulnerability EE model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/ee/vulnerability.rb):\n    - [ ] Add a new scope to also include `:notes` which will be further used by the export service.\n    - [ ] Add a new method (e.g., `notes_summary`) which will traverse `discussions` and each underlying `note`. status will be based on the first `note` of each `discussion`.

If there are no \"block auto-created users\" settings enabled, the user can directly sign into GitLab on the first attempt.\n\nHowever, if the \"user cap\" setting is specified, the user is redirected to the sign in page and shown a \"blocked pending Approval\" message: ![BlockedPendingApproval](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/e46d72028925a7325c7d0b7c1ab0aad0/BlockedPendingApproval.png) This happens even if the user cap is set to say 50 and the current number of users is 5.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up LDAP with GitLab SM.\n1. Sign-up with new user via LDAP.\n   * User account is created and user is signed in without any issues\n1. Change User Cap settings in admin dashboard to some arbitrarily high number (say 100)\n1. Sign in with another new user\n   * User will be redirected back to sign in page with Blocked Pending Approval warning\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nOn first sign-in via LDAP, new user is always blocked pending approval even if the billable user count does not exceed the user cap count setting, and the following message is shown:\n\n`Your account is pending approval from your GitLab administrator and hence blocked. Please contact your GitLab administrator if you think this is an error.`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nNew user should be active if the billable user count does not exceed the user cap count setting.\n\n### Investigating the source code\n\nNew user remains blocked pending approval if [`blocked_auto_created_omniauth_user?`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/7e749491133e4b8cc873f562925f1a3bb08bf009/ee/app/workers/set_user_status_based_on_user_cap_setting_worker.rb#L18) returns `true`.\n\n```ruby\n  def blocked_auto_created_omniauth_user?(user)\n    ::Gitlab.config.omniauth.block_auto_created_users \u0026\u0026 user.identities.any?\n  end\n```\n\n`::Gitlab.config.omniauth.block_auto_created_users` default is `true` and `user.identities.any?` returns `true` if the user sign-up via LDAP.\n\n### Workaround\n\nExplicitly change `omniauth.block_auto_created_users` setting in gitlab.rb to `false`.\n\n**NOTE:** New user state is active, but blocked during first sign in.

team member effort to clean up our backlog in %\"14.4\" related to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6732\n\nThere are about 320 issues to go through and 4 engineers. My first pass I looked at the 80 oldest issues. And grouped them into the following groups:\n\n1. Move Epic from \"Backlog\" to \"Awaiting Further Demand\"\n1. Recommend Closing\n1. Suggested for possible refinement.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnTA0D0xqyfZ8YPTXAgpEBkH0LE58hcykqrUbF-l9H8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Approaches:\n\n\n\n### Protect \n\nAll feature work issues are promoted to epics, and assigned to current epic roadmap. If it doesn’t fit into the existing epic roadmap, issue is closed.  Bugs, performance items, and tech debt remain as issues because they are typically small and self contained in one work item.\n\n**Example:** \n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5526 -\u003e https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6846 \n\nYoutube coffee chat: https://youtu.be/jaWo9Y7jqE0 \n\n**Analysis:** Backlog is kept very small because Epics aren’t issues. Issues are only created to reflect actual implementation work, and we usually don’t create implementation issues until we are ready to work on them. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### Experiment 1\nClose out issue and apply labels auto closed and stale and vintage\n\n**Example:**\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6712\n\n**Analysis:** It’s hard to know which issues are still desirable if we run a script. If we make assumptions about creation age and last activity we may blindly close issues that are still desirable. Requires manual intervention by subscribed parties to re-open.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 2\nApply %Backlog milestone and the ~Accepting Merge Requests label and ~secure::parked. \n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-10-12_at_11.33.16_PM](/uploads/88809763121ca65b55c697513ed85c48/Screen_Shot_2021-10-12_at_11.33.16_PM.png)\n\nExample:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5741\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/8636\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nIssues with ~Accepting Merge Requests in the %Backlog already exist. For this experiment I’ve created a ~secure::parked label so we can filter out our backlog search with label != ~secure::parked\n\nWe can run the script for issues older than a pre-determined time and with activity older than a pre-determined time and apply the ~secure::parked label while leaving the issue open\n\nWhen looking for issues to work on we search the backlog for issues without the ~secure::parked label\n\nStill requires manual analysis per issue to determine if we prefer to close it as no longer valid or desirable.\n\n￼\n---\n\n## Experiment 3 \n\nLeave open, move from %backlog to %awaiting further demand \n\n“Awaiting further demand” typically means an idea seems worthwhile but lacks validation or clear customer demand. Tend to put this on internal feature suggestions that don’t have a clear line of sight to an existing feature or roadmap item or weren’t the result of customer feedback.\n\n**Examples:**\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9382\n\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nOnly a small subset of issues in the backlog fall into this category. Issues that contain a `TBD` Proposal section, or lack finer detail. Usually created by a PM or developer as an “idea” to look into or further validate/follow up on. \n\nRequires manual analysis by a human to determine this outcome, hard to automate.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-16T21:26:50.490Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T04:13:14.395Z","closed_at":"2021-10-20T04:13:14.376Z","closed_by":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"labels":["Deliverable","auto updated","devops::secure","frontend","group::analyzer frontend","meta","section::sec","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"}],"author":{"id":5412787,"username":"nmccorrison","name":"Neil McCorrison","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5412787/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nmccorrison"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341079","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341079","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341079/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/341079/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#341079","relative":"#341079","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#341079"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6732,"epic":{"id":347428,"iid":6732,"title":"Secure Frontend Backlog Cleanup","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6732","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93817489,"iid":341078,"project_id":278964,"title":"Secure Frontend Backlog Cleanup -

Content-Disposition","description":"ZD: https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/227621 \n\nWhen using Azure object storage with `proxy_download` set to `false`, downloading a named CI artifact doesn't send back a `Content-Disposition`:\n\n![image](/uploads/cbf9f9178aaa10cf1485baa523791e77/image.png)\n\nSteps to reproduce.\n\n1. Configure Azure with consolidated object storage.\n1. Be sure to set `proxy_download` to `false`.\n1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nimage: alpine:latest\n\ntest:\n  script:\n    - date\n    - mkdir -p test\n    - echo \"hello2\" \u003e test/test.txt\n  artifacts:\n    name: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME}${CI_JOB_NAME}${CI_PIPELINE_ID}\n    paths:\n      - test\n```\n\nIf you attempt to download the artifact, you see `download` appear as the filename:\n\n![image](/uploads/60429840693aa1f3d44f5e9e541af35c/image.png)\n\nWorkaround is to set `proxy_download` to `true`.\n\nThis problem doesn't happen with S3 and Google Cloud Storage because the `response-content-disposition` parameter in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/a78d0b3f62f8da85a63b8e7eb67db60c20da1e0a/app/controllers/concerns/send_file_upload.rb#L13 is passed along as a query string to the request. Both Amazon and Google Cloud Storage honor this query string and return `Content-Disposition` in the HTTP headers, so this just works.\n\nAzure behaves differently. Azure requires a `rscd` parameter in the SAS query string (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/service-sas-examples).

Once an SRE on call and Release Manager on call confirm, you can proceed with the rollout\n- [x] Announce on the issue an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com\n- [x] Enable on GitLab.com by running chatops command in `#production` (`/chatops run feature set sync_namespace_name_with_cdot true`)\n- [x] Cross post chatops Slack command to `#support_gitlab-com` ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#where-to-run-commands)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Announce on the issue that the flag has been enabled\n- [x] Remove feature flag and add changelog entry.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [ ] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set search_sort_merge_requests_by_popularity \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on production environment. `/chatops run feature set search_sort_merge_requests_by_popularity true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `search_sort_merge_requests_by_popularity`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `search_sort_merge_requests_by_popularity` feature flag.

group members, with access inherited from parent group, continue to have project access even after invited subgroup is transfered","description":"**[HackerOne report #1330806](https://hackerone.com/reports/1330806)** by `joaxcar` on 2021-09-05, assigned to GitLab Team:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nI have found an issue similar to the one fixed in patch 14.2.2 [link](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/08/31/security-release-gitlab-14-2-2-released/#invited-group-members-continue-to-have-project-access-even-after-invited-group-is-deleted) where users had access to a shared project even after the invited group was deleted.\n\nThe problem is caused by the group inheritance, when a user shares a project with a subgroup the users from any parent groups are given access to the project as well (which is the documented behavior, see image). The problem is that if the subgroup is later transferred to another parent group, the users in the new parent group will get access to the shared project, but the users from the old parent group does not get their access revoked.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nFurther, if the subgroup which was the target of the shared project is subsequently deleted, only users with access stemming from the current parent groups are revoked. This leaves the project in a state with no apparent invited groups or other members, but with \"ghost\" members with anything from `Guest` to `Maintainer` access depending on the initial invitation.\n\nA \"worst care scenario\" is that a user shares a project with a group with `maximum access level` at `maintainer`, because the user trust the maintainers. This group is later added as a subgroup to another group temporarily for some reason, and then again transferred to its own hierarchy. Any maintainers or owners of this temporary parent group will now have hidden `maintainer` access to the project, even if the invited group is deleted.\n\nThis hidden access seems to be persistent until the project owner starts editing project access again, inviting a new group will \"kick out\" all hidden members as it seems.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\nOne basic scenario to prove the vulnerability, having three users in a group and moving the subgroup with the shared project out from the parent group. \n\n1. Create three users `project_owner`, `group_owner` and `hidden_maintainer`  \n2. Log in as `group_owner` and create two groups `target_group` and `temporary_parent`  \n3. In `target_group` create a subgroup `subgroup01`  \n4. Invite `project_owner` as a `Developer` of `target_group`  \n5. Invite `hidden_maintainer` as a `Maintainer` of `target_group`  \n6. Log in as `project_owner` and create a __private__ project `project01` in the user namespace, https://domain.gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project  \n7. Go to https://domain.gitlab.com/project_owner/project01/-/project_members and click \"invite group\". Search for and select `target_group / subgroup` and \"max-role\" `Maintainer`. Click \"Invite\".\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n8. Log in as `group_owner` and go to https://domain.gitlab.com/groups/target_group/subgroup01/-/edit and expand the \"Advanced\" tab at the bottom.  \n9. Scroll to the option \"Transfer group\" and select `temporary_parent` and click \"transfer group\".\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n10. When the group is now part of `temporary_parent` go to https://domain.gitlab.com/groups/target_group/subgroup01/-/edit again and expand the \"Advanced\" tab. Now scroll to the bottom and click and accept \"Remove group\"  \n11. As `group_owner` go to https://domain.gitlab.com/project_owner/project01 and verify that you get an 404 not found error (this user is no member any more)  \n12. Log in as `hidden_maintainer` and go to the same https://domain.gitlab.com/project_owner/project01 and verify that this user have access  \n13. Go to https://domain.gitlab.com/project_owner/project01/-/project_members and verify that the list only include `project_owner`\n\nAnother scenario would be to have the `hidden_maintainer` as a member of `temporary_parent` and transfer the `subgroup01` to `temporary_parent` and then directly back to `target_group`. This would \"touch\" the `hidden_maintainer` and give it access to the group. In these examples the invited group is a subgroup from start, this is not necessary. It could as well be a regular group that is then transferred to a parent group and then moved back out again.\n\n\n#####  Example  \nUser [REDACTED] having access to the private project owned by [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]\n\n#####  Impact\n\nUsers can get hidden unauthorized access to a project that is shared with a group where the users access is inherited. In the worst care scenario a user could acquire hidden __maintainer__ access to a __private__ project! The user will have full access to the project as a maintainer including settings and repository.\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen a group containing shared access to a project is transferred out from a parent group, the users of the parent group will retain their access to the shared project.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen a group containing shared access to a project is transferred from a parent group users in the parent group should lose access to the project.  \n#####  Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nUsers can get hidden unauthorized access to a project that is shared with a group where the users access is inherited. In the worst care scenario a user could acquire hidden __maintainer__ access to a __private__ project! The user will have full access to the project as a maintainer including settings and repository.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

observability to Snowplow pseudonymization service","description":"## Background\n\nThis issue  is a follow up to :dart: suggestions raised in review (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/product-intelligence/snowplow-pseudonymization/-/merge_requests/3#note_678631459) and in walk though, that current implementation of AWS Lambda pseudonymization service provides very poor visibility into what records were successfully processed and which ones were handled by fallback mechanism\n\n## Goal \n\nProvide simple to use obervability mechanism into which records were processed successfully and which failed and was processed by fallback mechanism \n\n## Solution ideas to explore and validate\n\n### 1. Add sentry reporting\n  Add call to sentry whiting fallback processing. There are two things that might be more problematic. First all gems added to Lambda function has to be packaged in `vendors` directory and load path has to be modified to include them. What's more AWS Lambdas size can't surpass 10 MB. Second AWS Lambda has upper time execution constraint of 15 minutes, and making external http request adds external dependence that might cause processing to hang.\n  \n~~It might be possible to use Sentry AWS integration https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340997#note_679258689~~\n\n~~\u003e Sentry has an [AWS Lambda integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/) that uses (I think) [Lambda Extensions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-extensions-in-preview/) instead of the usual approach of adding instrumentation code. Maybe it's worth checking out.~~\n\nEdit: AWS Lambda integration only supports Python and Node runtimes\n\n\n### 2. CloudWatch\n  It might be considerable alternative to use AWS monitoring solution of [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to record successes and fallback and failures. Right now there is simple chart included in [Snowplow dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/resource-groups/cloudwatch?dashboard=SnowPlow\u0026region=us-east-1#) that monitor number of invocations, errors and successes\n![Screenshot_2021-09-16_at_09.53.12](/uploads/6b4c663c2875fb7b6f360331911f2007/Screenshot_2021-09-16_at_09.53.12.png)\n\n  We can explore if it is possible to track custom defined metrics and if so, we might consider adding one for purposes of fallback processing. In case tracking custom metric is available another downside of CloudWatch solution would be limited access to dashboard\n\n https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340997#note_679258689\n  \u003e It's possible to create [custom CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/custom-metrics.html). It's not strictly error monitoring, but even with low data dimensionality we could set up a metric that tracks non-fatal error rates, for example. We would probably have to include the AWS SDK in the code.\n\n### 3. Dedicated Kinesis data pipelines\n  Instead of fallback processing within the same data stream, records that failed might be put to new dedicated Kinesis streams. That way we would be able to monitor them with CloudWatch by default, as well as provide dedicated processing of our choosing. This approach at initially stage seems as most robust one, however it would require the most work, it also might require adding AWS sdk gem to lambda, which has symiliar concerns to 1 solution.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-16T07:34:16.859Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T13:36:16.412Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T10:56:35.278Z","closed_by":{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"},"labels":["PI System Reliability and Monitoring","auto updated","backend","devops::growth","group::product intelligence","section::growth","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"}],"author":{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4807002,"username":"mikolaj_wawrzyniak","name":"Mikołaj Wawrzyniak","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4807002/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikolaj_wawrzyniak"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340997","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340997","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340997/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340997/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#340997","relative":"#340997","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#340997"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6739,"epic":{"id":348774,"iid":6739,"title":"Pseudonymization 1.0","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6739","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93753466,"iid":340982,"project_id":278964,"title":"Make environments picker dropdown not load all environments at once","description":"\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n### Summary\n\nThe [`threat_monitoring/components/environment_picker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/components/environment_picker.vue) works by its parent component/s calling [`fetchEnvironments`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/store/modules/threat_monitoring/actions.js#L43), which retrieves **ALL** of the environments.\n\nThis can be a problem for projects with many environments because the environment picker will take a long time to load\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`Usage #1: Policies List`\n1.

The dropdown works with infinite scrolling, where when a user scrolls to the bottom of the first 20 environments, another 20 are retrieved\n\n### Design\n\n![infinite scroll dropdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/uploads/4f9d0e43fcee62a39ed15286541d2bbe/Frame_1.png)\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- [ ] ~frontend update the environment picker/request to only request 20 policies at a time\nand implement infinite scrolling\n  - [`environment_picker.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/components/environment_picker.vue)\n  - [`environment_vuex_module`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/store/modules/threat_monitoring/)\n  - [`usage #1 component`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/components/policies/policies_list.vue)\n  - [`usage #2 component`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/components/policy_editor/policy_editor.vue)\n  - [`usage #3 component`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/components/threat_monitoring_filters.vue)\n\nRelated to #340339.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-15T23:34:51.585Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T07:03:12.849Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T17:28:43.892Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"labels":["Category:Security Policy Management","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","UX","auto updated","bug::performance","devops::govern","direction","frontend","frontend-weight::5","group::security policies","missed:14.4","section::sec","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"}],"author":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340982","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 1 checklist item completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340982","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340982/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340982/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#340982","relative":"#340982","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#340982"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6611,"epic":{"id":332582,"iid":6611,"title":"Follow-on Improvements for the Security Policy Editor","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6611","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93740219,"iid":340965,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate feasibility of data for in-product MR survey","description":"## Problem to Solve\n\nAs part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1475 we're interested in running a survey on MRs to determine how users perceive performance and usability of the merge request. Users visiting MRs would be prompted to fill out the survey, with an external link to the survey. Within the survey we want to include some data automatically (so users don't need to self-select) which will better help to classify the results of survey data.\n\n## Purpose of the Spike\n\nThe specific items we're looking to include automatically are:\n\n1. MR days: Number of days in the last 30 days that the user visited an MR page.\n1. Account age: Number of days since user's account creation.\n1. Paid plan: Whether the user is a member of 1+ paid group(s) or not.\n\nWe need to understand if this data is available and could be appended to URLs uniquely (e.g. `https://{surveyURL}/?mr_days=A\u0026account_age=B\u0026paid_plan=true`), or if this data would require further engineering effort to make available (and an estimate of that effort).\n\nThe survey prompt (i.e. banner) should be dismissable, and after the user clicks on the external survey link or dismisses the prompt, that specific user should not see the banner again. Not tied to the browser or device, but to the **user**. That should be possible using `UserCallout`. The dismissal should be valid for **90 days**.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-15T18:41:34.362Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T14:33:30.381Z","closed_at":"2022-02-24T15:17:53.127Z","closed_by":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"labels":["Deliverable","auto updated","devops::create","frontend","group::code review","merge requests","missed-deliverable","missed:14.4","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","section::dev","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":77,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340965","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340965","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340965/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/340965/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#340965","relative":"#340965","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#340965"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7859,"epic":{"id":493565,"iid":7859,"title":"In-product survey on MRs performance","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7859","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93739527,"iid":340961,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add grafana graph for large artifacts upload latency","description":"## Summary\n\nAs part of [the corrective actions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5533) for [incident 5521](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5521), ~\"group::testing\" is in charge of setting up a way for us to view performance of uploading large artifacts (\u003e= 1GB).

[x] `/chatops run feature set vulnerability_location_image_filter true --staging`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status fa6da1765412ed840fd5754b0badaa84629a19c9`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338669) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing projects/groups first\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab vulnerability_location_image_filter true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss vulnerability_location_image_filter true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com vulnerability_location_image_filter true`\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set vulnerability_location_image_filter \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set vulnerability_location_image_filter \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment. `/chatops run feature set vulnerability_location_image_filter true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338669) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338669) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `vulnerability_location_image_filter`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340915` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `vulnerability_location_image_filter` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338669) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete vulnerability_location_image_filter --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete vulnerability_location_image_filter --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete vulnerability_location_image_filter`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set vulnerability_location_image_filter false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-15T09:33:56.306Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T07:03:27.226Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T23:01:05.505Z","closed_by":{"id":480804,"username":"thiagocsf","name":"Thiago

When writing in Markdown, this is less of a problem because 1) there are fewer buttons in the toolbar and 2) most people can or prefer to write Markdown directly. \n\nHowever, in the Content Editor, the toolbar is a more critical component of the editor. Having this UI unavailable on the screen becomes a hassle and requires distracting scrolling to access core features. \n\n## Proposal\n\nMimic the behavior of the issue description editor. \n\n1. Start small. The size of the editor on a new page is great. \n1. Grow as I type some content. It's helpful to scale the editing area as my content grows.\n1. Have a maximum height. At a certain point, the field is too tall to fit in my browser window.\n1. At the max height, introduce a vertical scroll to ensure the toolbar is available at all times\n\nWe should do this for the \"classic\" wiki editor and the Content Editor. \n\n![classic](/uploads/70754c2371c4c4504577a2af5b16daef/classic.gif)\n\n![content](/uploads/f83b0167d4d7ac9f7701189de0e08612/content.gif)\n\n## Questions\n\n1. What is the correct max height? Is this something we can do based on relative line height or current window size? Or does it have to be hard-coded at some line length? \n1. What do we lose here?

This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338217#note_674887646\n\nMR widgets and Security tab only allow you download the scanned URLs and not the JSON artifacts\n\n### Proposal \n\nAdd JSON artifact download actions for DAST to the MR security widget and Pipeline security tab by converting the existing button to a dropdown button. \n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/security_reports/constants.js` add entries for\n\n```\n  [REPORT_TYPE_DAST]: SECURITY_REPORT_TYPE_ENUM_DAST,\n  [REPORT_TYPE_DEPENDENCY_SCANNING]: SECURITY_REPORT_TYPE_ENUM_DEPENDENCY_SCANNING,\n  [REPORT_TYPE_CONTAINER_SCANNING]: SECURITY_REPORT_TYPE_ENUM_CONTAINER_SCANNING,\n  [REPORT_TYPE_CLUSTER_IMAGE_SCANNING]: SECURITY_REPORT_TYPE_ENUM_CLUSTER_IMAGE_SCANNING,\n  [REPORT_TYPE_LICENSE_COMPLIANCE]: SECURITY_REPORT_TYPE_ENUM_LICENSE_COMPLIANCE,\n```\n\n- In `ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/pipeline/security_reports_summary.vue` swap out `gl-link` for `security-report-download-dropdown`\n\n-  Update `findArtifacts` to merge the results of `extractSecurityReportArtifacts` and `scanSummary.scannedResourcesCsvPath`\n\n- Format of artifact is:\n\n```\n    acc.push({\n      reportType,\n      name: getName(reportType),\n      path: downloadPath,\n    });\n```\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n\n* [Cameron (Compliance Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#cameron-compliance-manager)\n* [Parker (Product Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#parker-product-manager)\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Presley (Product Designer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#presley-product-designer)\n* [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sasha-software-developer)\n* [Devon (DevOps Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#devon-devops-engineer)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n* [Rachel (Release Manager)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#rachel-release-manager) \n* [Alex (Security Operations Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#alex-security-operations-engineer)\n* [Simone (Software Engineer in Test)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#simone-software-engineer-in-test)\n* [Allison (Application Ops)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#allison-application-ops) \n* [Priyanka (Platform Engineer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#priyanka-platform-engineer)\n* [Dana (Data Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#dana-data-analyst)\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.

We are also not clearly communicating what events are in alerts; when there are multiple events, we're not allowing people to see what those events are. We're currently only displaying information about the first event _only_, which can be problematic, as the payloads may not actually be identical. \n\nNearly all of the things that people wanted to see are things that would likely need to be provided to us in the alert payload (for example, better titles/descriptions, information about thresholds/current values, links to relevant metrics/logs, ways to investigate health status of associated clusters, environment information). So the problem is twofold: both getting more robust information sent to us in the payloads, and then ensuring that additional information is visible and actionable on the alert detail page.\n\nWe can currently receive and display content from an `annotations` field in [Prometheus alerts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/metrics/alerts.html#trigger-actions-from-alerts). However, we don't clearly surface those annotations within the alert in a readable way (they are currently displayed in a continuous string within the \"Details\" section of the alert details table). Also, we don't accept or display `annotations` from non-Prometheus alerts.\n\n### Proposal :pencil: \n\n- Update the alert overview to allow for a denser display of information.\n- Surface payloads for all events that have been grouped together within the alert. The events will now be the table rows, rather than the current key/value pairs.\n- Allow people to send annotations in payloads for _all alerts_, not just for Prometheus alerts. This will allow people to supply us all the content that's necessary for properly triaging the alerts, including links to runbooks, dashboards, and additional relevant details about the alert itself.\n- Prettify the alert payload so that each key/value pair will be broken into separate lines. \n- Ensure that any links within the payload are clickable.\n\n| Design | Walkthrough of changes |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Monospace_for_code](/uploads/b1d68b5e81426fd93d5b42881051fbce/Monospace_for_code.png) | ![Walk_through_of_changes](/uploads/182937c1eb8f65e52aaf8ed795933527/Walk_through_of_changes.png) |\n\n[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/TbrCvSUnsf1lSPEzU1BfO4/Improve-alert-experience-gitlab-com%26340851?node-id=720%3A2094)\n\n_**Note: Before implementing this issue we'll need to explore how to safely collect event data.
