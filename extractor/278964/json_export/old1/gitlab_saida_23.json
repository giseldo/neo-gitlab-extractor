This means that these attributes should be added to the `assignment` event (for `pql_three_cta_test` experiment) as well as for `Upgrade Now` and `Start Trial` CTA events.

Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360639) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `async_mr_close_issue`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `async_mr_close_issue` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360639) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete async_mr_close_issue --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete async_mr_close_issue --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete async_mr_close_issue`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set async_mr_close_issue false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-04T09:37:34.628Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T14:56:45.482Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T03:43:14.381Z","closed_by":{"id":1884221,"username":"patrickbajao","name":"Patrick

The idea being that we need much less data to provide a collapsed summary. For some widgets the collapsed/uncollapsed state use the endpoint.\n\nFor others, that are optimized like License Compliance, we have 2 endpoints. All of the ~\"group::secure\" widgets suffer from the `204 - No Content` problem as described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361286\n\n## Problem\n\nThe Widget extension has polling only for the collapsed endpoint. The assumption being that if the data is available in the collapsed state, then we should have data ready for the expanded state. \n\nThe problem with ~\"group::secure\" widgets is that we parse report artifacts after a successful pipeline run. The parsed results are cached. The caching layer works at the endpoint layer. By having **two different** endpoints, the **collapsed** endpoint will eventually show a 200 - OK with data populated. This assumes we solve https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361286. That result is cached. \n\nWhen we expand the widget, we hit the fullData endpoint. Because it's a different endpoint, the results are a `cache miss`, and the reports are then re-generated. We then end up with the `204 - No Content` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361286 problem all over again.\n\n## Problem Workflow\n\nInitial page load -\u003e initial widget load -\u003e 204 - No Content Response - Continue to Poll until 200 OK -\u003e then show widget summary -\u003e Expand widget -\u003e Attempt to fetch fullData endpoint -\u003e Another 204 - No Content -\u003e Another exception caught because we have no data -\u003e Widget errors out\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_8.09.09_PM](/uploads/d9cfb88ce72beb75874236eeba07ef39/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_8.09.09_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_8.08.45_PM](/uploads/f153d10b78557ffb1aa6f29098719e00/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_8.08.45_PM.png) \n\n## Solution\n\nAllow for something like `enablePollingFullData` so we can implement the same polling logic as the `enablePolling` flag for the collapsed endpoints. Handle 204/200 or any other successful status code\n\n## Gotchas\n\n- We need to solve how we want to handle polling in for `204 - No Content` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361286. It blocks this issue\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nBased off the work in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/87107\n\nIn: app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/components/extensions/base.vue\n\n1. Leverage the existing `enablePolling: true` setting.\n1. Update\n\n```\n    loadAllData() {\n      if (this.hasFullData) return;\n\n      this.loadingState = LOADING_STATES.expandedLoading;\n\n      this.fetchFullData(this.$props)\n        .then((data) =\u003e {\n          this.loadingState = null;\n          this.fullData = data.map((x, i) =\u003e ({ id: i, ...x }));\n        })\n        .catch((e) =\u003e {\n          this.loadingState = LOADING_STATES.expandedError;\n\n          Sentry.captureException(e);\n        });\n    },\n```\n\nto something like\n\n```\n    loadAllData() {\n      if (this.hasFullData) return;\n\n      this.loadingState = LOADING_STATES.expandedLoading;\n\n      if (this.$options.enablePolling) {\n        if (this.fetchFullMultiData) {\n          this.initExtensionFullDataMultiPolling();\n        } else {\n          this.initExtensionFullDataPolling();\n        }\n      } else {\n        this.fetchFullData(this.$props)\n          .then((data) =\u003e {\n             this.loadingState = null;\n             this.fullData = data.map((x, i) =\u003e ({ id: i, ...x }));\n          })\n          .catch((e) =\u003e {\n             this.loadingState = LOADING_STATES.expandedError;\n             Sentry.captureException(e);\n          });\n      }\n    },\n```\n\n1. Implement `initExtensionFullDataMultiPolling` and `initExtensionFullDataPolling` as something like:\n\n```\n   initExtensionFullDataMultiPolling() {\n      const allData = [];\n      const requests = this.fetchMultiData();\n\n      requests.forEach((request) =\u003e {\n        const poll = new Poll({\n          resource: {\n            fetchData: () =\u003e request(this.$props),\n          },\n          method: 'fetchData',\n          successCallback: (response) =\u003e {\n            const headers = normalizeHeaders(response.headers);\n\n            if (typeof headers['POLL-INTERVAL'] === 'undefined') {\n              poll.stop();\n              allData.push(response.data);\n            }\n\n            if (allData.length === requests.length) {\n              this.setFullData(allData);\n            }\n          },\n          errorCallback: (e) =\u003e {\n            poll.stop();\n            this.loadingState = LOADING_STATES.expandedError;\n          },\n        });\n\n        poll.makeRequest();\n      });\n    },\n    initExtensionFulLDataPolling() {\n      const poll = new Poll({\n        resource: {\n          fetchData: () =\u003e this.fetchFullData(this.$props),\n        },\n        method: 'fetchData',\n        successCallback: ({ data }) =\u003e {\n          if (Object.keys(data).length \u003e 0) {\n            poll.stop();\n            this.setFullData(data);\n          }\n        },\n        errorCallback: (e) =\u003e {\n          poll.stop();\n\n          this.loadingState = LOADING_STATES.expandedError;\n        },\n      });\n\n      poll.makeRequest();\n    },\n```\n\n1. Implement `setFullData` as something like:\n```\n    setFullData(data) {\n       this.loadingState = null;\n       this.fullData = data.map((x, i) =\u003e ({ id: i, ...x }));\n    },\n```\n\n1. Attempt to refactor and generalize the `initExtensionFullDataMultiPolling`, `initExtensionFullDataMultiPolling`, `initExtensionFulLDataPolling`, `initExtensionPolling` functions to reduce code duplication\n\n1. Update existing components with `enablePolling: true` behave correctly with the changes in the implementation plan by passing the full response object instead of the data only. Update unit tests as well\n\napp/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/extensions/accessibility/index.js\n\napp/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/extensions/test_report/index.js\n\nee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_merge_request_widget/extensions/metrics/index.js","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-04T01:05:40.381Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T12:05:41.127Z","closed_at":"2022-07-07T07:50:16.789Z","closed_by":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"labels":["Deliverable","Merge Request Report Widgets","WorkingGroup::MergeRequestReportWidgets","devops::create","frontend","group::composition analysis","missed-deliverable","missed:15.1","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"}],"author":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361295","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/361295","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/361295/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/361295/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#361295","relative":"#361295","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#361295"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6644,"epic":{"id":337727,"iid":6644,"title":"Merge Request Report Widgets Working Group","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6644","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":107964168,"iid":361287,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove cve from vulnerabilities and remediation in security report schemas","description":"\u003c!--\nImplementation issues are used break-up a large piece of work into small, discrete tasks that can\nmove independently through the build workflow steps.

All information is treated equally and given equal vertical real estate, which makes mobile tables really tall. If we were to simply change seat usage to act like storage, each row would take up an entire screen worth of vertical real estate.\n\nExamples around GitLab:\n\nGroup members:\n\n| Group members |\n| ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.29.17_PM](/uploads/847c89a970d392d687a05160dda2f2b7/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.29.17_PM.png) |\n\nIssues list:\n\n| Regular | Narrow |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.30.49_PM](/uploads/709f92b371fea67ca021b813a9f58f85/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.30.49_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.30.58_PM](/uploads/c8ff1c6ba53bfb602b44a0bbce159782/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.30.58_PM.png) |\n\nThis is the first example I've seen where some information is hidden on mobile.\n\nPipelines:\n\n| Regular | Narrow |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.46.21_PM](/uploads/bfa5c304a3f9e00480c90dd5b199934a/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.46.21_PM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.46.38_PM](/uploads/5e219dcbc2233d49a4ff1c938322f06e/Screen_Shot_2022-05-03_at_1.46.38_PM.png) |\n\nPipelines shows everything, but it does move the \"trigger\" into the Pipeline field instead of giving it its own field.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIt seems like the right way to collapse a table is to invert it from columns to rows, like most of the examples. But that doesn't mean we need to show every piece of data. We should think about the data and create priorities for what to show on mobile.\n\nThe exploration doesn't answer the question about how to deal with the expand/collapse area being

UPDATE: This has been promoted to the following issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381757+\n* [x] Review all comment threads on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84220 for pending tasks, and create MRs as appropriate. UPDATE: Done, all threads which still need follow-up have been captured in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361241\n  1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84220#note_909137776 - \n  1. `dialect` vs `flavor` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84220#note_903091005\n  1. Revisit usage of `scripts/lib` directory, because it sometimes isn't handled properly by Spring. Possibly needs to be added to Spring config.

However, before GitLab 15.1, there was no hint about this required permissions, which created confusions for users without the **Owner** permission, when some groups where not visible for them in the Import page. In this milestone, we added a dismissible notification that tells the user that only groups that the user is the Owner of them are visible. \n\n\n\nWe are requiring **Owner** permissions in order to migrate group.

Check out the parent epic for more details on this project. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523\n\n## Context\n\nThis is part of the work to upgrade and migrate the GitLab.com container registry to a new version backed by a metadata database and online garbage collection (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523). This will be achieved following the gradual migration plan detailed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/374.\n\nFor the gradual [Phase 2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7423) production rollout, we'll split the work into 5 portions, in this order:\n\n1. **GitLab Org**: We'll start by testing with some custom-made container repositories under `gitlab-org/` and then allow all of its new container repositories to be handled by the metadata DB;\n1. **Free Tier**: Following the GitLab Org rollout, we will proceed with a general rollout for the Free tier\n1. **Paid tier (with less than 6000 tags)**: After the Free tier, we'll work through a gradual migration of paid customers, excluding major, VIP customers. To start, we'll focus on images with less than 6000 tags.\n1. **Paid tier (with more than 6000 tags)**: Since migrating images with more than 6k tags needs to happen over the weekend, we'll attempt to bundle all of these in one or two more weekends.\n1. **Major customer** To reduce the risk of impacting users of the GitLab.com container registry that have large amounts of data, a very high activity, or very high availability/stability requirements, we will exclude these from (2) and handle them in this step with a manual gradual rollout, customer by customer.\n\n## Task\n\nPerform general rollout for existing image repositories for the Paid tier for images with less than 6000 tags on GitLab.com. \n- Track progress in the [migration dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/registry-migration/registry-migration-detail?orgId=1)\n- Avoid any customers marked as [VIP](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350933)\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-02T21:17:46.982Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T12:03:59.451Z","closed_at":"2022-07-19T11:33:34.053Z","closed_by":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Container Registry Migration::Phase 2","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","Package:P1","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":4829721,"username":"hswimelar","name":"Hayley Swimelar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4829721/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hswimelar"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4829721,"username":"hswimelar","name":"Hayley Swimelar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4829721/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hswimelar"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361115","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/361115","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/361115/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/361115/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#361115","relative":"#361115","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#361115"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7423,"epic":{"id":425806,"iid":7423,"title":"Container Registry Phase 2 gradual production rollout","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7423","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":107889453,"iid":361109,"project_id":278964,"title":"[SaaS] Add messaging about user overage process to Renewal flow","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nSaaS customers are being surprised and taken off-guard by Quarterly Subscription reconciliations.

Create a new project with the following `setup.py`:\n\n   ```py\n   from setuptools import setup\n   \n   setup(\n       name = \"test project\",\n       version = \"0.0.1\",\n       install_requires=[\n           'keyring==23.3.0',\n       ]\n   )\n   ```\n\n1. Scan the above project with `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2`\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-setuptools/-/jobs/2402622659\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`gemnasium-python` process exits with status 1 and no reports are created.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`gemnasium-python` process should exit with status 0 and it should create `cyclonedx-*.json` and `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json` files.\n\n### Workaround\n\nOverride the `image` field of the `gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning` job to specify the `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9` [image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-setuptools/-/blob/ee0d3202b49bdd482019aa30bc4ef8c723b0c463/.gitlab-ci.yml#L12-13):\n\n```yaml\ngemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:\n  image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9\n```\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nRecently, [v4.2.0 of the typing_extensions library](https://github.com/python/typing/blob/master/typing_extensions/CHANGELOG.md#release-420-april-17-2022) dropped support for Python 3.6, which causes [vrange/python/rangecheck.py](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/blob/c6253e9/vrange/python/rangecheck.py) to fail with the following error if the project being scanned uses `typing_extensions v4.2.0`:\n\n\u003e `Keyring is skipped due to an exception: module 'typing' has no attribute '_SpecialForm'`\n\nWe can fix this by adding a constraint to the `typing_extensions` package to ensure that `v4.2.0` is _not installed_, and a version that supports `Python 3.6` is installed instead.\n\n1. Update [requirements.txt](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/4b7ad0b/requirements.txt#L20-20) to add a constraint to the `typing_extensions` package:\n\n   ```shell\n   typing_extensions\u003e4.1,\u003c4.2\n   ```\n\n1. Add an [image integration test case](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/blob/4b7ad0b/spec/image_spec.rb#L286-307) to show that this bug has been fixed.\n\n/cc

This is very time consuming and error-prone, especially if a project has dozens of protected branches or when the protected branches changes.\n\n### Proposal \n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nAllow users to define an approval rule they would like to use for all protected branches in a project.

Update the UI text for **all** instances of `Any eligible user` and `Any branch` as they are used by the same components across the product\n    1.

Web Assembly (WASM) is maturing and may provide an opportunity to solve the remote development needs for at least some of our customers, particularly those working on JavaScript applications. \n\n## Scope\n\nThe completion of this issue should be an assessment of WASM as a front-end option for remote development. Answering the questions: \n\n1. Can we meet our customers' expectations with a purely browser-based solution? \n2. What functionality can be achieved using WASM today? \n3. What functionality can we imagine being available in the next 12-24 months? \n4. What features are never going to be possible with a browser-based solution? \n\n## Details\n\nOne of the big hurdles to rolling out a remote development offering is the amount of infrastructure required to provision and manage containers. What if we ran everything locally in the browser? \n\nOthers are paving the way in this area. [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [Replit](https://replit.com/) are two worth investigating. In particular, digging into Stackblitz's [open source projects](https://github.com/stackblitz) and [this blog post](https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/) about an open source implementation of Replit's browser-based runtime could help us understand if there is anything we can do in this space.

Stackblitz, among others, have been pushing the boundaries here and the future is very exciting. There are, however, significant limitations when compared to a server-based runtime environment. Specifically: \n\n- Browser runtimes are limited in the languages they can support\n- Complex, multi-project environments could be a very difficult challenge\n- It's only supported on Chrome and bleeding-edge browsers, though adoption is picking up speed\n\nThere are many benefits to weigh against those limitations, but for our customers and their complex environments, it will remain a long-term play and not something we look to implement in the near future.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-28T20:27:10.811Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T19:25:38.975Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T19:25:38.945Z","closed_by":{"id":5212466,"username":"ericschurter","name":"Eric Schurter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5212466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ericschurter"},"labels":["Category:Remote Development","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","auto updated","devops::create","feature::addition","group::editor","missed:15.4","missed:15.5","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5212466,"username":"ericschurter","name":"Eric Schurter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5212466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ericschurter"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360865","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/360865","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/360865/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/360865/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#360865","relative":"#360865","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#360865"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8291,"epic":{"id":552206,"iid":8291,"title":"Remote Development Direction 2: Browser runtime","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8291","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":107400002,"iid":360822,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove recruiting email from onboarding series","description":"The purpose of this issue is to remove the onboarding email specifically directing users to score their onboaridng experience and to register for an interview session. \n \nThis would was originally completed via this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/team-tasks/-/issues/314\n\nWhen this is done, let @jackib know so that the Calendly account can be paused.\n\n## Next Steps \n\n### Cleaning up the feature flag\n\n* [x] Ensure the onboarding email and related code is removed without breaking the email series.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com. \n- [x] Ensure that any breaking changes have been announced following the [release post process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes) to ensure GitLab customers are aware.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --random`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been included in the release package.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the monthly release was tagged](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run release check \u003cmerge-request-url\u003e \u003cmilestone\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

To get streaming audit event traffic on such allow lists, it must be set up, the `verificationToken` recorded, and then that token added to the allow list. This is a time-consuming process and it also means events will be lost between the time of setting up streaming and getting the token on the allow list. Instead, users would prefer a way to decide on a value and update both systems at once, rather than needing to do a multi-step process.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\nWhen the a streaming audit event destination is created, allow the user to optionally pass in their own value for `verificationToken` to be used. If the user provides the parameter in the API call, use that value instead of generating one.\n\n~~Note: Ensure the value is strong enough not to be guess (e.g. `dog` is bad, require a longer

This enables users with access to the project to view a list of project issues synced from a connected Jira project by visiting https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/jira/issues . And issue details by visiting https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/jira/issues/ISSUE_KEY\n\nWhen configuring this feature, the information states:  \n\u003e Warning: All GitLab users with access to this GitLab project can view all issues from the Jira project you select. \n\nThe maintainer of the project enters a `Jira project key` corresponding to the project that is to be connected.\n\nThe way GitLab handles this functionality is by requesting the maintainer to enter three things other than the project key\n\n1. Jira instance URL  \n2. Username  \n3. Password or API key (Api key for Jira cloud on atlassian)\n\nGitLab uses the username and password/Api-key when requesting information from the Jira API. This is also the source of the IDOR issue. The `Jira project key` is used to request the list of issues when visiting `/-/integrations/jira/issues`. The GitLab backend uses the key in a request like this one  \n```  \nhttps://username.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=project%20%3D%20%22PROJECTKEY%22%20AND%20statusCategory%20%21%3D%20Done%20order%20by%20created%20DESC\u0026startAt=0\u0026maxResults=20\u0026fields=assignee%2Ccreated%2Ccreator%2Cid%2Cissuetype%2Ckey%2Clabels%2Cpriority%2Cproject%2Creporter%2Cresolutiondate%2Cstatus%2Cstatuscategorychangeddate%2Csummary%2Cupdated  \n```  \nnote `?jql=project%20%3D%20%22PROJECTKEY%22%20` and is thus \"hard-coded\" from the project settings. But when visiting a detail page for a single issue `/-/integrations/jira/issues/KEY-1` the backend makes a request like   \n```  \nhttps://username.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/KEY-1?\u0026expand=renderedFields  \n```  \nhere GitLab use the KEY directly from the URL without checking it against the configured project key. This allows for all users that have access to the project to request details from ANY issue on ANY project where the maintainer (who have entered his/her username/password) have access. By changing the KEY part of the URL like  \n```  \n/-/integrations/jira/issues/ANYKEY-1  \n```  \nThis will fetch information on the issue from project `ANYKEY` instead of the configured project.\n\nFurthermore the \"attacker\" can also impact the private Jira issues by referencing them in commits and merge requests. In this way the attacker can add data into private Jira projects of the victim user. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/issues.html#reference-jira-issues for more info.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a user to use as the victim  \n2. Create a new public project (with minimum premium access to gitlab)  \n3. Register a new account on atlassian.net and activate Jira  \n4. Create two separate projects in Jira, one with project key `PUBLIC` and one with `PRIVATE`  \n5. Create an issue in both Jira projects.  \n6. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens and create an API token  \n7. Go back to GitLab and go to the new project settings  \n   ```  \n   https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/jira/edit  \n   ```  \n8. Fill out the form with Jira URL, username and API token (as password)  \n9. Also activate Jira Issues and enter the project key `PUBLIC`  \n10. Log in to GitLab as another user (the attacker)  \n11. Visit  \n    ```  \n    https://gitlab.com/GROUPNAME/PROJECTNAME/-/integrations/jira/issues/PRIVATE-1  \n    ```  \n12. You should see information of the private issue from the victim users other Jira project\n\n#####  Impact\n\nJira integration leaks issues from victims private Jira projects\n\n#####  Examples\n\nVisit my public project at\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/ultimate_joaxcar_2/kk/-/integrations/jira/issues\n\nThis page should list a public issue. Click the issue to go to\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/ultimate_joaxcar_2/kk/-/integrations/jira/issues/PUBLIC-2\n\nThis is the details page of the public issue. Now change the key to PRIVATE-1\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/ultimate_joaxcar_2/kk/-/integrations/jira/issues/PRIVATE-1\n\nNote that you now see information on a private project!\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGitLab uses Jira issue key directly from attacker supplied URL without matching it to the configured project key.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nA project should only fetch keys that match the configured key base\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nJira integration leak sensitive data from private issues to other users of GitLab. Other users can also add data to private issues by referencing them in MRs and commits.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this

`package_manager` field, and the `language` is set to `unknown-language`:\n\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"project\": {\n       \"path\": \"node_modules/await-to-js/dist/docs/assets/js\"\n     },\n

current *bug* behavior?\n\n`language` and `package_manager` fields are unknown or not present\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n`language` and `package_manager` fields should be correctly populated, and the name of the CycloneDX SBOM files should have the `package_manager`.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\n/cc @NicoleSchwartz @fcatteau

instead of Haml. However given how big the work is, we have divided each tab content into its own issue and MR. This specific issue is to make **the licenses tab content** render inside the nre tab structure in Vue. To do so, here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. When the feature is turned on, in `app/views/projects/pipelines/show.html.haml` we now have the `js-pipeline-tabs` element which uses a helper to pass down all the dataset we might need to our single Vue app.\n1. We now have 2 helpers: one for CE (`app/helpers/projects/pipeline_helper.rb`) and one for EE (`ee/app/helpers/ee/projects/pipeline_helper.rb`). Each of them is passing data down to the Vue app through the dataset. If your tab is both in CE and EE, then your data should live in the CE helper. If your tab is unique to EE, then you can pass it down trough the EE helper.\n1. We then have the pipeline init bundle (`app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/pipeline_details_bundle.js`) which will check if the flag is on. If it is, then we only create one app instead of one per tab\n1. Then the data is passed down through the app init function in `app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/pipeline_tabs.js`. Make sure to pass your new dataset here to the app. We conditionally render with `ee_else_ce` the right Vue tabs component. The CE component has a slot in which the EE component can pass all the additional tabs. This mean that the EE component always has the CE tab and logic for free :raised_hands_tone1: \n1. Then in the CE tabs component (`app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/components/pipeline_tabs.vue`) all tabs are rendered except the `failed jobs` component which will need to change the in failed jobs MR (we only show it if there are failed jobs!)\n1. In the EE tab component (`ee/app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/components/pipeline_tabs.vue`) we have conditional on each tab which comes from the API permissions. Permissions should already work as is for all tabs\n\n## Work required\n\n1. Check the previous haml that we were using for the tab (`app/views/projects/pipelines/_with_tabs.html.haml` or `ee/app/views/projects/pipelines/_tabs_content.html.haml`. What data are we passing down to the app? Add the same data to the right `pipeline_helper.rb` (CE or EE)\n1. After adding the right data, we also need to update the helper specs (CE: `spec/helpers/projects/pipeline_helper_spec.rb`, EE: `ee/spec/helpers/ee/projects/pipeline_helper_spec.rb`). Note that if you are passing data through the EE helper, we need to expect it in the CE helper as well.\n1. In `app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/pipeline_tabs.js`, pass your dataset to the Vue App. For this migration, we aim to pass all the data as it used to be without any changes. We can come back later to see if there are too many properties how we can better optimize this.\n1. **TAB SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION** Add a badge to the tab if it applies, so either: Failed jobs count, Tests count, Licenses count. You can refer to the job MR as to how this can easily be done: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85946\n1. Add the lazy property on the tab and make sure it still works as expected. This will ensure we only send the queries once the user click on a tab instead of loading them all at once.\n1. If the tab renders as expected and the badge is there, now it the time for specs!\n1. In `spec/frontend/pipelines/components/pipeline_tabs_spec.js` or/and `ee/spec/frontend/pipelines/components/pipeline_tabs_spec.js`, remove the stub for the tab content as it should no longer be necessary.\n1. **TAB SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION** If you have a count badge, add specs for it as needed. We should aim to use `it.each` in both the CE and EE version of the tabs spec (again, see the jobs tab MR for reference: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85946/diffs?commit_id=eacc76eec5a5991dea2008ddbf1c66d49cc985d5)\n1. **FAILED TAB SPECIFIC** If it's the failed jobs tab, make sure to test the tab renders only conditionally if there are failed jobs.\n1. Lookout in the table below for the tab you are working on. For all the ones that are listed, make sure to enable the right tests by removing the `pipeline_tabs_vue` stub in the specs.\n\n| Spec Name | Line number | Tab content required |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\nee/spec/features/projects/pipelines/pipeline_spec.rb | 174 | Licenses |\n\n1. Once you have an MR, please add the link to the table here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230749\n\nMR for reference: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85946/diffs?commit_id=eacc76eec5a5991dea2008ddbf1c66d49cc985d5\n\nFor any question, feel free to ping `@f_caplette`\n\n## Testing\n\nFrontend engineer shall update frontend unit tests. SET shall update any applicable End to End tests, and evaluate whether to edit or add new tests to support any new functionality within the pipeline tabs.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-28T11:13:53.884Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T08:44:28.016Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T05:15:11.780Z","closed_by":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"labels":["Category:License Compliance","GitLab Ultimate","Stretch","auto updated","devops::secure","frontend","group::composition analysis","maintenance::refactor","priority::1","quad-planning::complete-action","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"}],"author":{"id":5327378,"username":"f_caplette","name":"Frédéric Caplette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5327378/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/f_caplette"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360796","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/360796","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/360796/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/360796/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#360796","relative":"#360796","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#360796"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"}]
