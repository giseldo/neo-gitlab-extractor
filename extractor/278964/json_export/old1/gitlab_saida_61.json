Especially since I copied all of them [the instance-level security dashboard component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/instance/project_manager.vue) and they all seem to work. Maybe (as a follow-up) I should create a wrapper around `project-selector` that encapsulates all these methods for these two instances? Counter-point: There are only two instances, so maybe do that if there is a third instance? There are actually two other instances of the `project-selector` (instance-level [operations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/operations/components/dashboard/dashboard.vue) and [environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/environments_dashboard/components/dashboard/dashboard.vue) dashboards), but both of those use a `Vuex` store. Oh, there is a [`project_selctor Vuex store`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/store/modules/project_selector), should I be using that instead of these copy/pasted methods?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I will...look into this.\n\n\n### Implementation\n\nI talked to @ekigbo about this and we decided on a two pronged approach\n\n- [ ] 1. ~~Work on trying to merge the Vuex stores together so that the one in [`vue_shared`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/dashboards/store) is left. This can start by merging the actions; a lot of the actions are the exact same so import the actions from the `vue_shared` one into the other and delete the repeated actions. Then simplify any extra actions that do anything different and use that actions file as an override file. Hopefully by then we will be able to see if these Vuex stores can be condensed into one or if they need to be separate~~ Delete the [`security dashboard project selector Vuex store`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/store/modules/project_selector) as it is only used in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/spec/frontend/security_dashboard/store/modules/vulnerable_projects/mutations_spec.js, which seems like a mistake.\n![image](/uploads/8e9f0f631358c21cdbd53df4c9266ee1/image.png)\n- [ ] 2. Replace all the reused logic in [instance-level security dashboard project manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/components/instance/project_manager.vue) with the newly created [`instance_project_selector`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/threat_monitoring/components/instance_project_selector.vue) component.\n- [ ] As a side note, we should also create storybook stories for the [`project_selector`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/components/project_selector/project_selector.vue)\n- [ ] Friendly reminder to make sure to ask for a ~UX feedback after submitting the MR.\n\n## Additional context\n\nThe current implementation has a help text.

However, we don't seem to have more general user lockout documentation. \n\nI suspect we should create a new page within `doc/administration/`, explaining what leads to a lockout (10 failed sign-in attempts) and that the lock will automatically reset in 10 minutes. There is also an email sent to the user explaining this, as well as a link to unlock immediately. \n\n----- \n\n## Original description\n\n### Problem\n\nI'm using GitLab Community Edition Omnibus. After using GitLab for over 6 years. It is the first time I've encountered a locked user. There is no indication of this state under the Admin UI (we are on 13.12.5) nor is there a path to resolution.\n\nI found this [page](https://docs.gitlab.com/13.12/ee/security/unlock_user.html) on unlocking a user via the console. That resolves the issue for the user, but it's not intuitive.\n\n### Proposal \n\nThere are 2 issues to be addressed:\n\n* Under the Admin UI (probably under `/admin/users`) there should be some indication that a user is locked. One may argue that it isn't necessary because the user will alert an administrator to get the lock resolved. But for the following proposal, it would be necessary.\n  - Add `(Locked)` after the user's name\n* A mean to unlock a locked user via the UI, rather than the console.\n  - This does exist, but the documentation needs to be updated. Update docs to make note of the `Unlock` action. ![Screen_Shot_2021-08-12_at_7.57.45_AM](/uploads/b61eddf59f07d7b9d483f38ab597e85f/Screen_Shot_2021-08-12_at_7.57.45_AM.png)\n\n\nFrom the documentation, this state is triggered by 10 failed login attempts. Does it self correct after some grace period? The documentation doesn't say, so I assume it doesn't. For some one not versed in Ruby on Rails, the console method is obtuse, and it isn't obvious if it had worked.\n\nIt self-corrects after 10 minutes. This should be added to the documentation\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. Add `(Locked)` after the name of any locked user\n![Screen_Shot_2021-08-12_at_1.20.48_PM](/uploads/5621b44960f1660e614e16127c1f4d8e/Screen_Shot_2021-08-12_at_1.20.48_PM.png)\n1.

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62144#note_592236215):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e **thought:** I'm wondering why we're always destroying the installation, even if the self-managed instance didn't succeed.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I guess it makes sense when the self-managed instance is permanently gone, so we can still clean up the record on gitlab.com. When self-managed has a temporary problem it might make sense to try again (which I believe will already happen currently, since this is a worker and we don't `rescue` the exception), but at that point the `installation` won't exist anymore and the worker will just exit.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Also, this is happening in the background, so the app entry in Jira is already gone and the user can't re-trigger the uninstall event manually. And as Andy mentioned in the video Jira actually ignores errors from the uninstall endpoint, so I guess we can't be smarter about our response either. :thinking: \n    \u003e \n    \u003e I see two strategies:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1. Rescue errors and don't try again, which wouldn't work anyway as the installation is already destroyed on the next attempt.\n    \u003e    - I think we'd have to rescue `Gitlab::HTTP::HTTP_ERRORS`, and also check for `success?` on the `Gitlab::HTTP.post` call.\n    \u003e 2.

This allows us to use a custom CA certificate with `git` without requiring any external commands to be executed before running an analyzer, we just need to write the contents of the `/etc/gitconfig` configuration file.\n\nThis process works well in an offline environment where all GitLab components are self-hosted, and a single self-signed CA certificate is used to connect securely with each service, however, it doesn't work in the situation where some services are self-hosted, and others are not.\n\nFor example, in a self-hosted GitLab instance where a pipeline connects to itself to clone the source repo, it can use the self-signed CA cert provided by the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` variable, however, when `gemnasium` runs and `git` attempts to clone from the `gitlab.com` repo with the same self-signed CA cert, the process will fail, because this certificate is invalid for `gitlab.com`.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1. [x] Remove the code from the [common package](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/common) which writes to `/etc/gitconfig` that was added as part of [git certificate error with ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE on alpine containers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218634).

Enable the cron job for `BatchedBackgroundMigrationWorker` on self-managed instances and backport the change to %\"14.0\" as well (gitlab-org/gitlab#334996)\n1.  Revert the column swap migration for `push_event_payloads` (gitlab-org/gitlab!64577) on .com and do not release the migration to self managed instances.\n1. Release all the column swap changes on %\"14.2\" onwards\n  \n   That makes %\"14.1\" a safe release, with the batched background migrations able to automatically run and finish the backfilling of all `bigint` columns. \n\n1. Require that all self-managed instance upgrade through %\"14.1\"\n\n   That will allow instances to catchup, finish all the pending migrations and be ready for the column swap once they upgrade to the next version they plan to upgrade\n\nThe steps above will guarantee us that we have no instances facing the error mentioned in gitlab-org/charts/gitlab#2785, but there is no way that we can enforce that requirement right now, so instances may end up skipping %\"14.1\" and directly upgrading to a higher minor or major (%\"15.0\") version. If they are upgrading from a version prior to the patch that introduces the cron job in %\"14.0\" as well, then they'll get the error mentioned in gitlab-org/charts/gitlab#2785 once more.\n\nFor that reason, we also have to add documentation on how to recover from that error, either by running the migrations manually or going back to the `14.0.Z` patch, letting the migrations run and then upgrade.\n\nIn this is issue we want to cover all the documentation related updates:\n1. Require that all self-managed instance upgrade through %\"14.1\"\n\n   1. Add a [Version-specific upgrading instruction](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/index.html#version-specific-upgrading-instructions) similar to the requirement for going through [13.1](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/index.html#1310) or [12.0.Z](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/index.html#1200)\n\n   1. Explain that an alternative path is to go through `14.0.Z`, where Z is the patch version that gitlab-org/gitlab!65106 will end up being included to.\n\n   1. Update release notes for %\"14.1\" with that information as well (will be covered in gitlab-org/gitlab#335005 to unblock this issue from completing)\n\n1. Update the error message that the migrations show when the batched background migrations are still active:\n\n   `Expected batched background migration for the given configuration to be marked as 'finished', but it is 'active' ..`\n\n   To also include a link to the [Batched Background Migrations documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/monitoring/background_migrations.html)\n\n1. Add a section on the [Batched Background Migrations documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/monitoring/background_migrations.html) that will explain the steps necessary when upgrading from `14.0.Z`- to any release other than %\"14.1\" and they see that error.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-01T14:14:30.958Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:02:02.868Z","closed_at":"2021-07-20T13:17:38.520Z","closed_by":{"id":3910448,"username":"craig-gomes","name":"Craig

Since every API page has a maximum of 25 repositories, it seems like our code _thinks_ that there are no more repositories available after importing all repositories on the first API page.\n\nFor example, let's suppose a user has 80 repositories on GitHub and wants to import them to GitLab. To do that, GitLab would send an API request to GitHub to get the first API page of repositories. GitLab would need to request 4 API pages (25 repos each) in order to import all repositories. In a normal scenario, a new API page is automatically requested whenever a user scrolls to the bottom of the web page. In this case, when a user has already imported 25 projects of the first API page, after scrolling down, GitLab sends an API request to GitHub for the first API page again and the other API pages (2, 3 and 4) are never shown.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n- Create at least 26 repositories on GitHub (I created [this script to help me do that](https://gitlab.com/b_freitas/github-scripts/-/blob/master/github_project_creator.sh))\n- Import 25 repositories to GitLab\n- Refresh the web page\n- Scroll to the bottom of the web page and, you'll notice that the 26th repository will not show up\n\nTo fix it:\n- Delete one of the imported repositories in GitLab\n- Go back to the importing page\n- Scroll to the bottom of the web page and, you'll notice that 26th repository will show up\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nN/A\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!--

These include whether or not the document has updated, if there are any pending requests, timeouts, etc.\n\nThis MR proposes that a new CI/CD environment variable `DAST_BROWSER_PAGE_READY_SELECTOR` be made available to the user. When the user enters a selector of the login modal, the DAST browser-based crawler should check to ensure the element is not found or is hidden before classifying a page transition as complete.\n\n### More details\n\nThe issue arises as the DAST crawler assumes the page has finished loading when it is still showing \"Loading\". This can lead to:\n\n- Missed elements in the scan that will not be crawled.\n- DevTools will return the error `code: -32000 msg: Could not compute box model` when attempting to retrieve the position of elements that are occluded by a Loading modal (even if the modal is partially transparent). These are considered hidden elements by the scan and are not crawled.\n\nThe error is picked up in the following code. Note that when the error is found, it is not logged, and the element is assumed to be hidden.\n```go\nfunc (e *InternalElement) IsElementHidden() bool {\n\tx, y, err := e.GetPosition()\n\n\tif err != nil || (x == 0 \u0026\u0026 y == 0) || (x \u003c 0 || y \u003c 0) {\n\t\treturn true\n\t}\n```\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] Add `PageReadySelector` to browser-based scanner\n- [x] Upgrade DAST and add `DAST_BROWSER_PAGE_READY_SELECTOR` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/-/merge_requests/537\n- [x] Document `DAST_BROWSER_PAGE_READY_SELECTOR` in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/browser_based.html#available-cicd-variables.

Presumably this is not intended by gitlab users, and I'm hoping we can find a way to improve it.\n\n\n## Background and context\nIn January [gitlab began sending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7EDRaMRWPE) [deployment information](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-group-deployments) to Jira through the [Gitlab marketplace app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?hosting=cloud\u0026tab=overview) :tada: :tada: :tada:\n\nRecently when investigating the data sent from gitlab I noticed that gitlab is sending a surprisingly high number of deployment events of `unmapped` environment type - almost half of all deployments sent.\n\n![Deployment_events_from_Gitlab_by_Environment_Type](/uploads/609a93104e126bae337e822bee1cf34b/Deployment_events_from_Gitlab_by_Environment_Type.png)\n\nThe jira public rest api for submitting deployment information requires deployments to have an `environment` type of one of  `unmapped`, `development`, `testing`, `staging` or `production`. \n\nI believe gitlab attempts a mapping from the freeform field for `name` in the `gitlab-ci.yml` file to one of the 5 environment types above ^\n```\ndeploy_staging:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - echo \"Deploy to staging server yay\"\n  environment:\n    name: staging\n    url: https://staging.example.com\n\n```\n\nHowever this relies on users already having environment names in their `gitlab-ci.yml` that directly match the jira api's expected value. Users with environments such as stg, prod-east, dev, pre-prod etc would have the deployment event sent as \"unmapped\" and would see:\n\n![image](/uploads/e2eb660ba004b721e1ddac1aff8d8b3a/image.png)\n\n\n## Goals\n\nI'm hoping this raising this ticket can start a discussion on options to improve this for gitlab and jira users :)\n\nPotentially, a quick win could be extending the mapping logic described above to try to handle more cases. Perhaps this problem could also be addressed through documentation.\n\nThanks team!","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-01T05:43:34.557Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:38:44.832Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T11:36:24.746Z","closed_by":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Community contribution","Integration::Jira","Jira::ConnectApp","automation:ml","backend","devops::manage","feature::enhancement","group::integrations","section::dev","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},{"id":9229781,"username":"rbordignon","name":"Remy Bordignon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d58927f300d665c8957de2796684de?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rbordignon"}],"author":{"id":9229781,"username":"rbordignon","name":"Remy Bordignon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d58927f300d665c8957de2796684de?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rbordignon"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334953","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334953","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334953/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334953/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334953","relative":"#334953","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334953"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1626,"epic":{"id":10001,"iid":1626,"title":"Improving the Jira Connect App in Atlassian Marketplace","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1626","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89576006,"iid":334942,"project_id":278964,"title":"Change DB logging metrics per database to use db_config.name instead of database name","description":"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63490 we implemented logging per database. We used the database name as the key. But this won't actually work well for us in production where we expect we'll be using the same database name on 2 different database servers. The reason we'll plan to use the same database name is due to our migration plan https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/84588 using streaming replication to sync the databases.\n\nWe therefore cannot use the database name as the key as they will have the same name. Instead we can use `connection.pool.db_config.name` which is the name used in the GitLab application configuration to distinguish between the different databases.\n\nThe downside, however, will be that this may be `primary` depending on how you set things up locally. And therefore you may see `primary_primary` in logs as one of the primary refers to the R/W connection. However, we are planning on calling this `main` by default in config anyway so hopefully that will resolve things and people won't have `primary` in their configuration.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-01T00:18:12.374Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:22:28.905Z","closed_at":"2021-07-25T22:49:52.387Z","closed_by":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"labels":["Category:Pods","devops::data_stores","group::pods","section::enablement","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334942","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334942","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334942/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334942/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334942","relative":"#334942","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334942"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6134,"epic":{"id":285044,"iid":6134,"title":"Decomposition:  Create observability for multiple database servers","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6134","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89575483,"iid":334940,"project_id":278964,"title":"Show more specific error message when user attempts to create release with new protected tag","description":"### Background\n\nThis is a follow up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327505.

the problems raised as part of the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334690\nwas the concern regarding usage of a single `structure.sql` vs many `*structure.sql`.\n\n## Methods\n\nLets consider the following database config after the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333415, and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335076. This is expected end-goal type of config:\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_main\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_ci\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\n\u003e Remark: Today, everything by default uses `public schema`. This changes the `public` to become `gitlab_main` as an indication that most features use `main` database. This is discussed in more detail as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333415#ideally.\n\n### 1. Single `structure.sql`\n\nThe single `structure.sql` defines all tables and is populated on many databases,\nmaking us to duplicate the same structure in many places.\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_main\n  migration_paths: [db/migrate, db/post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_ci\n  migration_paths: [db/migrate, db/post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\nThe `structure.sql` represents a definition of the whole logical database.\n\nThis model:\n\n- Provides a bloated `structure.sql` that is replicated on many databases\n- This implies that a shared `db/migrate` and `db/post_migrate` needs to be used\n  to replicate all migrations on both databases\n- There is a risk that we might run migrations in context of another database, with different schema visibilty\n  where it can result in running some migrations many times\n- Example to consider is the migration procedure: we migrate `data of gitlab_ci schema` into separate\n  database server, how we will run migration on `gitlab_main` for the `gitlab_ci`? Will we skip them\n  or run all of them replicating their behavior\n- Likely we need to introduce a schema matcher as part of `requires_schema` to check this against\n  our `schema visibility` and only run it there\n- Likely this requires (due to how rails manages `structure.sql`) to create a symlink between `ln -s structure.sql ci_structure.sql` to ensure that the same schema is used\n- Likely this requires modifying Rails from emitting `ci_structure.sql`\n\n```sql\n# structure.sql\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_main;\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_ci;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_main.projects;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_ci.ci_builds;\n```\n\n```ruby\nclass MyMigration \u003c ActiveRecord::Migration\n  requires_schema :gitlab_main\n  # requires_schema :gitlab_ci\n\n  def up\n    #\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### 2. Many `*structure.sql`\n\nIn this model we have many `*structure.sql`, dedicated for each logical database:\n\n- `db/structure.sql` defines a structure for `main` database\n- `db/ci_structure.sql` defines a structure for `ci` database\n\nThe `*structure.sql` represents a definition of the whole logical database.\n\n```sql\n# structure.sql\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_main;\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_ci;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_main.projects;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_ci.ci_builds;\n\n# ci_structure.sql\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_ci;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_ci.ci_builds;\n```\n\nThis implies that each structure has its own set of migrations. There might be different\nmodels how migrations can be executed, depending on iterations:\n\n#### Model 1: distinct folders\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_main\n  migration_paths: [db/migrate, db/post_migrate, db/ci_migrate, db/ci_post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_ci\n  migration_paths: [db/ci_migrate, db/ci_post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\n- `db/migrate`, `db/post_migrate` - migrations for `db/structure.sql`\n- `db/ci_migrate`, `db/ci_post_migrate` - migrations for `db/ci_structure.sql`\n\nThis requires that each migration concerning CI needs to be copied into `db/migrate`\nas we don't perform automated reply of them on top of `db/structure.sql`.\n\nThis models:\n\n- Provides a bloated `structure.sql` that is used on main database, and clean `ci_structure.sql`\n- Requires that all migrations of CI are run as well on `main`\n- Requires a way to discover what schema is being modified (likely, by convention, files put into `db/ci_migrate` modify `gitlab_ci` schema)\n- There is a risk that we might run migrations in context of another database, with different schema visibility\n  where it can result in running some migrations many times\n- Example to consider is the migration procedure: we migrate `data of gitlab_ci schema` into separate\n  database server, how we will run migration on `gitlab_main` for the `gitlab_ci`? Will we skip them\n  or run all of them replicating their behavior\n- We need a way to ensure consistency between part of the `structure.sql` and `ci_structure.sql` (a special `pg_dump` to validate that subset of schema is exactly the same)?\n\n#### Model 2: inherited folder\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_main\n  migration_paths: [db/migrate, db/post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_ci\n  migration_paths: [db/migrate/ci, db/post_migrate/ci]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\n- `db/migrate`, `db/post_migrate` - migrations for `db/structure.sql`, which will additionally execute all nested migrations from `/ci`\n- `db/migrate/ci`, `db/post_migrate/ci` - migrations for `db/ci_structure.sql`\n\nThis requires that each migration concerning the CI needs to be in `db/migrate/ci`.\n\nThis models:\n\n- Provides a bloated `structure.sql` that is used on main database, and clean `ci_structure.sql`\n- Requires that all migrations of CI are run as well on `main`\n- Requires a way to discover what schema is being modified (likely, by convention, files put into `db/migrate/\u003cschema_name\u003e` modify `gitlab_ci` schema)\n- There is a risk that we might run migrations in context of another database, with different schema visibility\n  where it can result in running some migrations many times\n- Example to consider is the migration procedure: we migrate `data of gitlab_ci schema` into separate\n  database server, how we will run migration on `gitlab_main` for the `gitlab_ci`? Will we skip them\n  or run all of them replicating their behavior\n- We need a way to ensure consistency between part of the `structure.sql` and `ci_structure.sql` (a special `pg_dump` to validate that subset of schema is exactly the same)?\n\n### 3. Many `*structure.sql` schema focused\n\nThis is likely our end-goal. Have clean `*structure.sql` containing only definitions\nrelated to processed data.\n\nIn this model we have many `*structure.sql`, dedicated for each set of schema visibility:\n\n- `db/structure.sql` defines a structure for `public` (or proposed `gitlab_main`) schema, used with `main` database\n- `db/ci_structure.sql` defines a structure for `gitlab_ci` schema, used with `CI` database\n\n```yaml\nmain:\n  database: gitlab_main\n  migration_paths: [db/migrate, db/post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_main,gitlab_shared\nci:\n  database: gitlab_ci\n  migration_paths: [db/ci_migrate, db/ci_post_migrate]\n  schema_search_paths: gitlab_ci,gitlab_shared\n```\n\nThis approach moves away from having a structure.sql defining a whole logical database,\ninstead moves into schema management. This is an approach that is natively supported by Rails\nwith `config.active_record.dump_schemas = :schema_search_path`, which allows to clearly define\nwhich schemas are to be dumped.\n\nThis approach implies that many configurations for many connections are used, allowing\nto point to the same logical database, but managing only subset of the database with schema.\n\nThis models:\n\n- Requires that we do not use a single connection for many schemas as described as [1. A single monolithic database (not migrated), with a single connection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335076#1-a-single-monolithic-database-not-migrated-with-a-single-connection). This will not work, since we will not have a single big `structure.sql`. This might be a blocker for some installations, but as well this is a great end-goal to have.\n- All migrations are run within a specific connection, and specific defined visibility\n- Schema search path defines a visibility and we don't need to add additional semantic for migrations\n- Since we do not run migrations many times, we guarantee that migrations process only what is needed\n- We don't need to maintain consistency, since we guarantee that these are self-sufficient structures\n- In a transition period the `main: { schema_search_path: gitlab_main,gitlab_ci }` can be used to avoid bugs related to cross-joins\n- Provides a truly clean `*structure.sql` without any unrelated schemas\n\n```sql\n# structure.sql\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_main;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_main.projects;\n\n# ci_structure.sql\nCREATE SCHEMA gitlab_ci;\nCREATE_TABLE gitlab_ci.ci_builds;\n```\n\n### 4. Problems to solve\n\nThis defines a set of problems that we want to solve, these are not tied to particular method,\nbut rather a set of a general design guidelines which are not ordered by the importance:\n\n- a clean/tidy `structure.sql` containing only relevant tables required by a given database\n- easy and predictable behavior of migrations without duplication or overlap\n- predictable behavior and support for non-migrated customers: customers using a single monolithic database\n- predictable behavior for partially migrated customers: ex.: data got copied, many databases are used, but old database still contains all CI data as it is not yet cleaned-up\n- easy way to develop new migrations without hacks/extra checks about execution context (ex. of anti-pattern is `Gitlab.com?`)\n- coherency of structure between databases that is automatically validated\n- predictable behavior and tracking of schema migrations and background migrations\n- we need a way to model and maintain shared tables:

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Prevent tasks from being created through the current issue creation flow.\n\n## UX Screens\nView recording of prototype here:   \n![Screen_Recording_2022-01-18_at_11.26.53_AM](/uploads/e2815b0316d76aa6efaf02e65abe1660/Screen_Recording_2022-01-18_at_11.26.53_AM.mov)  \n\n\nSteps noted:\n* User hovers (desktop) or taps (mobile) on the MD list item and seen an option to \"Convert to work item\"\n* Selecting this option launches a modal with an editable version of the title and type. Also shown here is Weight and Assignee (are these MVC?)\n* Saving as-is makes the task convert to a work item with a badge showing the type\n* Work item is added as a Related item\n\n\n**QUESTION:** Have we designed any error states / toasts / user feedback when an error happens for the new work item UI? We'll need that for this issue if there is an error when creating the issue. \n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Clicking on a button next to a markdown taskable opens the new work item modal/sidebar (create mode).\n- [x] The title is prefilled with the text string from the markdown taskable.\n- [x] The title can be changed from within the modal before clicking create. \n- [x] Successfully creating the task closes the modal and replaces the markdown taskable plain text with a GFM reference to the issue of type `Task`.\n- [x] Clicking cancel or clicking out of the modal cancels the creation process and closes the modal/sidebar. \n- [x] If there is an error when creating, the Task detail view provides context to the user. \n- [x] Styled appropriately for Mobile and Desktop.  \n- [ ] Snowplow tracking implemented\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n- Same permissions as existing issue permissions. \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- Yes\n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n- E2E test for converting markdown taskable to issue of type `Task` \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n- Count of `Task` created weekly/monthly\n- Count of MAU creating `Task` weekly/monthly\n\n## FE Event Trackers\n\nStructured event taxonomy: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/snowplow/#structured-event-taxonomy\n\nWhen the \"convert to task\" button is clicked:\n\n```\ncategory: workItems:show\nlabel: work_item_create\naction: click_markdown_taskable_create_button\nproperty: [type_{{insert issue type}}]\n```\n\nNote: `[type_{{insert issue type}}]` is intended to future proof this tracker a bit as we will likely allow the selection of type prior to the modal/sidebar at some point in the future. We can hard code this for now if we remember to update it when/if this happens later :smile: \n\nWhen the work item is successfully created. Do not fire event until success from server:\n\n```\ncategory: workItems:new\nlabel: work_item_create\naction: create_work_item_success\nproperty: [work_item_type_{{insert issue type}}]\n```\n\nWhen the work item creation process is cancelled (clicking cancel OR mousing out):\n\n```\ncategory: workItems:new\nlabel: work_item_create\naction: create_work_item_cancelled\nproperty: [work_item_type_{{insert issue type}}]\n```\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n**MR 1, UI**:\n\n* [x] Add button to `Convert to Task`\n* [x] Make button open modal/sidebar with new work item detail view (create mode)\n* [x] Prefill title with text from markdown taskable and auto-focus keyboard/cursor on the title input\n* [x] Clicking out of the modal/sidebar before creation cancels the process\n* [x] Click cancel in the modal/sidebar cancels the process\n\nThis part will require a bit of refactoring on the router logic on create view. Instead of redirecting to the previous route, we'll need to close the \"sidebar modal\"\n\n**MR 2, working with API**:\n\n* [ ] Click create uses the `createWorkItem` mutation\n* [ ] After creation, replace the markdown taskable text in the description with a GFM issue reference to the newly created Task.\n* [x] Provide a way for the user to understand any errors if they happen when clicking create.\n\nCurrently, the Create view already utilizes `gl-alert` component to show an error on `createWorkItem` mutation.\n \n\n\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION

GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n\n## Problem to solve\n\nUsability improvement for Tasks! A natural element of a task is the assignee. Tasks should be assignable.\n\n## Proposal\n\n\n- Tasks can be assigned to one (~\"GitLab Free\") or more (~\"GitLab Premium\") users\n- If someone is `@` mentioned in the markdown taskable, pre-fill the assignee(s) on the task view (create mode)  \n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Search for assignees\n- [x] Add assignees\n- [x] Remove assignees\n- [x] Quick apply assign to self\n- [x] Close manage assignee modal\n- [x] Show avatars of assigned users on work item view\n- [x] Supports existing \"invite members\" workflow\n- [x] FE event tracker\n- [x] Redis counter\n- [ ] Unify assignees code in the backend from issuable services and widget service\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?--\u003e\n\n- Same permissions as existing issue permissions. \n\n### Documentation\n\n\u003c!-- See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html\nAdd all known Documentation Requirements here, per https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature-change-workflow.html#documentation-requirements\nIf this feature requires changing permissions, this document https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html must be updated accordingly. --\u003e\n\n- Yes \n\n### Testing\n\n\u003c!-- What risks does this change pose? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing? See the test engineering process for further help: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/ --\u003e\n\n- Write tests, but this will be iteratively developed behind a FF and not generally available. \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n\u003c!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. --\u003e\n\n- Work items are not yet a stage where we will be measuring quantitatively.\n\n### Tiering\n\n* Single assignee is ~\"GitLab Free\"\n* Multiple assignees is ~\"GitLab Premium\"\n\n\n## FE Event Trackers\n\n```\ncategory: workItems:show\nlabel: el\naction: assigned_user\nproperty: [type_{{insert issue type}}]\n```\n\n```\ncategory: workItems:show\nlabel: el\naction: unassigned_user\nproperty: [type_{{insert issue type}}]\n\n```\n\n## Redis counter\n\n```markdown\n- **name:** `users_updating_work_item_assignees` \n- **category:** `work_items`\n- **redis_slot:** `users` \n- **include in the following aggregation counters:**\n  - [x] `xmau_plan`\n  - [x] `xmau_project_management`\n  - [ ] `xmau_product_planning`\n  - [ ] `xmau_certify`\n  - [x] `users_work_items`\n```\n\n### Release Notes\n\nTasks represent discrete work units necessary to complete an issue. You can now assign tasks to a single individual in GitLab Free or multiple people in GitLab Premium or Ultimate. Assigned tasks can be accessed from your personal issues dashboard and are filterable by assignee from within a project's issue list. \n\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html#assign-users-to-a-task","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-29T15:58:33.184Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T11:39:02.928Z","closed_at":"2022-09-19T18:56:08.385Z","closed_by":{"id":3507264,"username":"donaldcook","name":"Donald Cook","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3507264/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/donaldcook"},"labels":["Category:Issue Tracking","Category:Portfolio Management","Category:Team Planning","GitLab Core","Stretch","UX","backend","design-weight::2","devops::plan","direction","documentation","epics","frontend","group::project management","missed-deliverable","missed:14.4","missed:15.1","missed:15.3","release post item","release post item::in review","section::dev","tw-weight::3","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453026,"iid":76,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.4","description":"[GitLab 15.4 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v15.4.0-ee)","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:22.015Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:21:26.561Z","due_date":"2022-09-17","start_date":"2022-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/76"},"assignees":[{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"}],"author":{"id":4669960,"username":"cdybenko","name":"Christen Dybenko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4669960/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cdybenko"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2880930,"username":"engwan","name":"Heinrich Lee Yu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2880930/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/engwan"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334810","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":15,"completed_count":12},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"12 of 15 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334810","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334810/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334810/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334810","relative":"#334810","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334810"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7103,"epic":{"id":382735,"iid":7103,"title":"✅ Work Items - Tasks","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":{"id":62776,"iid":76,"sequence":21,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-06-07T00:05:01.842Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T00:05:02.139Z","start_date":"2022-08-03","due_date":"2022-08-16","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/62776"},"health_status":null},{"id":89490724,"iid":334809,"project_id":278964,"title":"View and edit the description of a Task (MVC 1)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!-- What problem do we solve? --\u003e\n\nI need to add a description to a work item. \n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- How are we going to solve the problem?

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n- [x] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance.

These schemas won't need to diverge until %15.0 and at that point we can create the different directory for migrations.\n\u003e ...\n\u003e GitLab.com the database schema will be the same anyway as we're doing it via streaming replication of the current main database so this avoids a weird divergence in production\n\n1. Keep *exactly* the same database schema between `database:main` and `database:ci` \n1. Isolate tables: In this iteration, `ci_instance_variables` is identified as `belongs to CI` and should be isolated. More CI tables will be isolated like this.\n1. Discovery: When looking at the `database:ci` database, I want to only see `belongs to CI` tables\n1. Disallow cross-joins: When connected to `database:ci`, we want to error out hard when queries join across tables that `belong to CI` and that don't.\n\n### Solution: Managed search path\n\nThis can all be done without introducing an additional database schema and additional migration methodology for the `database:ci` database:\n\n1. We always deploy the same schema to `database:ci` and `database:main` (this is goal (1) after all) - keep doing what we already, use `db/structure.sql` and migrations as SSOT for that\n1. We create an additional postgres schema (`CREATE SCHEMA gitlab_ci`) for CI\n1. For a connection to `database:main`, we add `gitlab_ci` to the `search_path = public, gitlab_ci, ...`\n1. For a connection to `database:ci`, we limit the search path to `search_path = gitlab_ci` (goal (3) - limited discovery + goal (4) - disallow cross-joins)\n1. We add a migration that moves `ci_instance_variables` to `gitlab_ci` schema (this is a metadata op: `ALTER TABLE... SET SCHEMA gitlab_ci` (goal (2) - isolate table)\n\nManaging the `search_path` is supported by Rails (part of the connection config).\n\nExpanding on goal (4) - disallow cross-joins: A connection to `database:ci` will only \"see\" what's in the `gitlab_ci` schema. An attempted `select * from ci_instance_variables JOIN other_table_in_public` will error out hard, because this table is not visible. \n\nUpon a later stage, when we actually want the `database:ci` database schema to *diverge*, we introduce separate schema management for `ci`. When we have that, we can simply drop the `public` schema (with everything in it). Given the implications for self-managed below, we may not want to to do this step (we don't need it - there's no harm in having a few empty tables around :shrug: ).\n\n#### How to iterate on extracting a group of tables, e.g. `ci_*`\n\nIn this summary, we aim to extract CI-related tables and change the application to remove cross joins to unrelated tables. The goal is to be able to extract this set of tables into an entirely different database.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Create a schema inside `db:main` for the group, e.g. `gitlab_ci`\n1. Move relevant tables into this schema - transparent for the application (append search_path)\n1. Identify and remove cross joins to adapt the application\n1. Once compatible, use `db:ci` connection with a `search_path` limited to `gitlab_ci` to have an isolated view of the database for CI\n1. Once this is proven to work, tables in `gitlab_ci` can actually be taken out of `db:main` and moved into `db:ci` (if desired, e.g. GitLab.com). No application changes needed apart from changing the database connection config (different database)\n\nAll this can be done and shipped today, to both GitLab.com and self-managed. There is no need for infrastructure or omnibus changes supporting this.\n\n### Discussion\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. All goals achieved :white_check_mark: - a soft separation of tables that is easy to deal with\n1. We can start very quickly: Start with step (1) of the solution above and you'll already have `ci_instance_variables` available to you in `database:ci` (albeit not isolated - this can be done in later steps)\n1. Ability to selectively validate isolation changes avoiding big bang changes. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334690#note_614694876.\n1. No dependency/support needed for infrastructure and omnibus changes to start with isolating application logic and tables (can all be deployed to GitLab.com/self-managed today)\n1. No change at all to how we manage the database schema (includes post-deploy/background migrations)\n1. Transparent to anybody else outside the \"sharding\" effort\n1. Self-managed: Can ship to self-managed just with regular migrations - no special treatment needed\n1. Self-managed: Huge plus (see below) - no need for separate databases unless desired\n  1. Logical backups (pg_dump) continue to produce consistent dump if only one database\n1. We don't necessarily need https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334227 to implement schema comparison checking - the schema will be based on the same migrations and hence be equivalent by design.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. We know how to work with different postgres schemas (we already do), but not all our custom migration helpers support it completely (~\"group::database\" to check and make sure this works). No urgency here since we don't expect to do a lot of migrations on `ci_instance_variables` soon.\n1. If we wanted to have a different schema \"on the other\" side (in `database:ci`) to e.g. incorporate partitioning changes before we migrate data, this would need some work. Can be dealt with as needed and as we design the data migration parts later (it's not needed today).\n\n#### Self-managed vs. GitLab.com\n\nThis is a huge plus for self-managed: They will only need **one** database, they don't need to migrate data to a separate database if that is not needed (for scaling purposes). A standard self-managed install keeps having one database only but has a few schemas: `public, gitlab_ci, gitlab_AAA, gitlab_BBB, ...`. This can even result in using the same connection pool for the different roles (and configuring `search_path`, so that all tables are visible or manage it upon \"switching\" connections) instead of having one connection pool per role (which multiplies connections), reducing resource needs.\n\nAnother benefit is that backups (pg_dump) continue to work as-is for installations that keep having one database only. With multiple databases, taking a consistent snapshot is more involved.\n\nFor GitLab.com (or another large install), we'll break the database apart and extract each postgres schema into its own database. At this point, we already know that the relevant parts of the app (e.g. CI) works fine when they only \"see\" their own schema, e.g. only CI tables. So this step is a matter of designing the data migration only (we don't have to deal with app changes anymore).\n\nThis means we can also validate \"isolation changes\" (making sure that the app works when it doesn't see all tables anymore, but only specific ones) quickly and iteratively - we can ship it to GitLab.com without having to have a separate database already (with all the mechanics this needs) and it easily ships to self-managed, too.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-28T14:18:59.273Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:22:31.613Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T11:49:56.178Z","closed_by":{"id":12452,"username":"ayufan","name":"Kamil Trzciński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a285e30f35d72526fb0954e8fe7cefa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ayufan"},"labels":["Category:Pods","devops::data_stores","group::pods","section::enablement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/487c4c74f7e1714b5a270e00d4735e84?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334690","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334690","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334690/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334690/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334690","relative":"#334690","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334690"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6103,"epic":{"id":281355,"iid":6103,"title":"Decomposition: Support for many databases","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6103","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 16, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89413328,"iid":334689,"project_id":278964,"title":"FE: Max User count visualization","description":"This is the FE issue for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290202\n\nLocation: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321933/#note_557291192","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-28T14:12:17.162Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T09:32:01.328Z","closed_at":"2021-07-18T01:39:38.615Z","closed_by":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"labels":["Deliverable","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","devops::fulfillment","frontend","group::utilization","section::fulfillment","spike","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":4961018,"username":"mlunoe","name":"Michael Lunøe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4961018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlunoe"}],"author":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4961018,"username":"mlunoe","name":"Michael Lunøe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4961018/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlunoe"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334689","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334689","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334689/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334689/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334689","relative":"#334689","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334689"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5872,"epic":{"id":257458,"iid":5872,"title":"Seats Usage -

I'm fairly sure displaying CI Build records is no longer correct (legacy).\n\n## Problems to solve\n\n- **Performance.** In group-level VSA, the default `test` and `staging` stages are timing out when listing the CI Build records. (Previously, it was hard to notice due to a frontend bug: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334487.) This is probably because the `test` and `staging` queries join on the `ci_builds` table and show build records on the UI. This makes the database scan way too many rows, which leads to statement timeout.\n- **Confusing UI.** A single MR will produce multiple CI Build records if there are multiple jobs in the pipeline (causing excessive granularity in the UI) or the pipeline is run more than once (causing duplication in the UI).\n\n## Proposal\n\nTo improve the UI, show MR records (instead of CI Build records) for the `test` and `staging` stages.  To improve the performance, eliminate the `JOIN ON ci_builds` because it will no longer be necessary.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. No change needed for the summary calculations (like median). The pipeline times are not used for those calculations.

SSF: Repository sync should update HEAD ref","description":"## Problem\n\nSome snippet repositories can fail verification even after successful resyncs because `HEAD` ref on the secondary isn't exactly the same as it is on the primary (it may not even exist at all on the secondary).\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333462 for gory details.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe need to do similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/8c924b4743031b4bb656df344751f9e0b74157db/ee/app/services/geo/repository_sync_service.rb#L57 in `FrameworkRepositorySyncService`. We should do this generically for `Repository` since this will be needed for many Repository types. And the only `Project`-specific part is when `change_head` enqueues `ProjectCacheWorker`.\n\nHere is a WIP commit aiming at doing the above https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/ccaacdb6e496792e3582cf8338806456271744ce","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-24T22:51:01.577Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T23:06:40.955Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T18:21:30.656Z","closed_by":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"labels":["Category:Disaster Recovery","Category:Geo Replication","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Premium","devops::systems","group::geo","priority::2","section::enablement","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"}],"author":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1144264,"username":"mkozono","name":"Michael Kozono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6243abba3cf112e6df4a5a644c5f86aa?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mkozono"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334586","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334586","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334586/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/334586/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#334586","relative":"#334586","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#334586"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2810,"epic":{"id":27925,"iid":2810,"title":"Geo: Self Service Framework - Snippet verification","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2810","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 22, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":89270312,"iid":334583,"project_id":278964,"title":"Prevent accidental deletion of container image repositories","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWhen deleting a container registry image, users can inadvertently delete the wrong thing.

The current solution at the top-level is to have everyone in at least 1 group. However, Minimal Access is not an option for Group Sync roles.\n\nThis can cause odd access issues, such as in https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/219713 , where it looks like what's happening is that when a user signs in, they're removed from the top-level because they're not in a SAML Group, but readded through the SAML Default Role. The problem is that the user gets a 404 when they first sign in due to the initial removal.\n\n**Note**: The behavior in which the user is readded to the Group via the SAML Default Role is not consistent on all the cases.\n\n### Proposal \n\nAdd Minimal Access role to the top-level SAML Group Sync list of possible roles.\n\n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue.

Syntax highlighting can be a critical aspect of reading and parsing code blocks and incorrect highlighting can make it hard to read code examples.\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet the author select the language for a code block. I should be able to click a dropdown and select the language from a list.\n\nLanguages to select from are derived by [supported languages for highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/):\n\n- HTML\n- Bash\n- C++\n- C#\n- CSS\n- Markdown\n- Diff\n- Ruby\n- Go\n- TOML\n- Java\n- JavaScript\n- JSON\n- Kotlin\n- Less\n- Lua\n- Makefile\n- Perl\n- Objective-C\n- PHP\n- Python\n- R\n- Rust\n- SCSS\n- Shell\n- SQL\n- Swift\n- YAML\n- TypeScript\n- VB .NET\n\n## User Experience Details\n\nWhen editing a file in the Content Editor, I should be able to:\n\n- Create a new code block with a default (plaintext) styling\n- Choose a syntax highlighting language from supported languages in `highlight.js`\n- Override the syntax highlighting language on any existing code block in the document\n- Preview the syntax highlighting immediately (the code block should be styled without having to save the document)\n\n### Future iterations\n\nIn later iterations, we could\n\n1. Attempt to automatically detect the language when code blocks are being written and set it to our best guess\n1. Bring consistency to code styling across the repository blob viewer, Web IDE, and code blocks in the Content Editor\n\n## Design\n\nFigma: https://www.figma.com/file/z5pzAvKoabaruwKH63lMm6/Code-block---Language-highlighting-%23334576?node-id=8%3A11337\n\n| Viewing | Block focused and editable |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/b0f8b2b2e4681b5fcf73ce34570ef396/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/191bf802b5461196f605903dbd5378e4/image.png) |\n\n| Scrolling |\n| ------ |\n| ![scrolling-codeblock](/uploads/87a6676b1b0e641f4badd5f2634d945f/scrolling-codeblock.mp4) |\n\n### Scrolling behaviour\n\nCurrently codeblocks do not have a limit on their height. The height is based on the content of the codeblock. When a codeblock is taller than the viewable area during editing, then the vertical scroll is associated to the editor not the codeblock.\n\nIn the future we could consider vertical scrolling on a codeblock for blocks larger than X lines. For example with snippets while editing after 28 lines there is vertical scrolling but when viewing the snippet it shows all of the lines.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. What should be the default? \n1.

This issue is to add versioning to the metrics.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. By metric, we should be able to identify when a metric was instrumented\n1. We should be able to filter the Metrics Dictionary by version\n\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nWe currently don't have `milestone` set for all metrics. It is okay to set all metrics to one milestone where it's missing and document this.\n\nPlease be aware of the feature explained in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6419) which we intend to build in the future. How these metrics are versioned may have an impact to that future work.\n\n## Work plan\n\n- Add milestone to metrics dictionary https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary/-/merge_requests/4\n- Update milestone regex to validate using \"\u003c13.9\", update a small set of metric definition https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69398\n- Update rest of metrics definition https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69400\n- Make the milestone field required, in
