[{"id":87196762,"iid":331117,"project_id":278964,"title":"SPIKE: Experiment tooling","description":"\nTLDR: In growth engineering there seems to be a consensus to go\nforward with the GLEX (GitLab experiment gem) implementation among\nengineering team members. In order to meet product requirements, we\nneed to be able to measure financial and other KPIs for individual\nnamespaces, projects, and users by being able to merge data in CustomersDot,\nZuora, Salesforce, GitLab.com, and VersionsDot App databases. The recommended \nnext step is to proceed with GLEX and add the ability to record some data into the\nsame backend tables, as is currently possible using EXMOD. We need to also improve the\ntooling and standardize the charts.\n\n\n## INVESTIGATION\n\nIn the growth team, we have the following ways to run experiments and\nlaunch non-experiment features which enable data-based decisions.\n\n1. Experimentation Module (EXMOD)\n2. GLEX\n3. Feature flag rollouts based on Flipper feature flags\n4. Snowplow-based tracking for measuring user interactions\n5. Data warehouse based analysis of gitlab.com, CustomersDot and other analysis\n4. User surveys\n\n\nI read through existing discussions and had sync surveys with\nsome growth engineers, product managers, and designers.\n\n## BUY OPTIONS\n\n1. Buying an experiment tooling is currently out of scope and but some risks counted are\n- Incorporating non-open source code into our codebase\n- Sending our data to 3rd parties\n- Complications of incorporating of the bought tools into our backend\n\n2. Product managers usually like:\n- The ability to run, stop/pause experiments with ease\n- Ability to get data quickly\n- Standard funnel charts and analytics make things easier to analyze\n\n3. Options discussed are Amplitude, Optimizely, LaunchDarkly\n\n## GLEX (Gitlab experiment gem) \u0026 the experiment context\n\nGLEX has a passionate energetic original developer and feature set\nwith a consistent design and with a lot of momentum. Engineers love\nthe (scientist-based) DSL. The decision to go with a gem or a library\nmatters less as the feature set is more or less stable. There seems to\nbe a hard learning curve, but the good thing is that most growth teams\nhave already done a few to a dozen experiments each. GLEX relies on a\nstandardized experiment context for snowplow tracking.\n\n## EXMOD (Experimentation Module)\n\nExperimentation module is used a lot within the acquisition/activation\nand conversion team, and also expansion. It is developed in a collaborative fashion and it\nshines whenever we need to measure namespace-based subscription metrics.\nThis is indispensable for experiment measurements based on real KPIs.\n\n\n## ROADMAP\n\nSet a target to standardize on GLEX. Enrich it to measure namespace-based\nKPIs. Enhance the tooling around it probably with a UI.  Deprecate\nEXMOD whenever all teams can run experiments that measure their\nKPIs.\n\n## TRACKING\n\nWe can use both Snowplow events and backend tables to measure the\ninteractivity and growth KPIS. Whenever product intelligence clears\nthe way to join them, by de-identification or a policy change, we can\nalso get rid of split-brain experiments and have a unified view.\n\n## LEARNINGS\n\n### Design/UX experiments\n\nUX wants to be able to run frontend/copy-related experiments which are\nindirectly affecting growth KPIs with ease. Like is a tooltip or a\nbanner better? Is \"Buy\" or \"Purchase\" or \"Upgrade\" better.\n\n### Product management view on buy vs build\n\nProduct management finds both in-house toolings still limited compared to the buy options.\n\n### Waterfall chart \n\nIt may show the effect of each experiment on growth KPIs.\n\n## Governance\n\nFor the time being the growth team should be developing the framework. But if growth product team is satisfied, we may get other teams within GitLab to run experiments too. At this stage, we may get a PM and a \"Growth foundations\" team member to manage experiment features.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-17T12:26:15.097Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T01:05:08.653Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T01:05:08.644Z","closed_by":{"id":4234774,"username":"pcalder","name":"Phil Calder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4234774/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pcalder"},"labels":["devops::growth","section::growth"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331117","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331117","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331117/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331117/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331117","relative":"#331117","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331117"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4935,"epic":{"id":145822,"iid":4935,"title":"Growth Experimentation Roadmap","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4935","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87190487,"iid":331107,"project_id":278964,"title":"Handle non-committed changes when switching branches in the pipeline editor","description":"### Summary\n\nWhen switching between branches on the pipeline editor using the branch switcher, changes are not persisted.\nSwitching away from a branch, then switching back to it, discards your changes and shows the config as it was when you first loaded the page.\nThis happens to both committed and non-committed changes.\nThis issue addresses the less severe of the two, non-committed changes.\nUncommitted changes will be fixed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331105\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Run `ssh-add` to add the key to the agent\n1. Connect to bastion with agent forwarding `$ ssh -A lb-bastion.gprd.gitlab.com `\n1. Create named screen `$ screen -S \u003cusername\u003e_usage_ping_\u003cdate\u003e`\n1. Connect to console host `$ ssh $USER-rails@console-01-sv-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal`\n1. Run `SubmitUsagePingService.new.execute` \n1. Detach from screen `ctrl + a, ctrl + d`\n1. Exit from bastion `$ exit`\n\n#### Verification (After approx 30 hours)\n\n1. Reconnect to bastion `$ ssh -A lb-bastion.gprd.gitlab.com `\n1. Find your screen session `$ screen -ls`\n1. Attach to your screen session `$ screen -x 14226.mwawrzyniak_usage_ping_2021_01_22`\n1. Check the last payload in `raw_usage_data` table: `RawUsageData.last.payload`\n1. Check the when the payload was sent `RawUsageData.last.sent_at`\n\n#### Stop Usage Ping process\n\nRecord the host the usage ping is generated\n\nConnect to host generating usage ping\n\nuser name: `amihaila` \n\n```\nssh bastion-01-inf-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\n```\n\n```\nsudo -u \u003cusername\u003e screen -ls \nsudo -u \u003cusername\u003e screen -r\n\n# or\n\nps faux | grep \u003cusername\u003e\n\n# find process and kill it\n```\n\n### Usage Ping process triggering (through long running ssh session) \n\n1. Connect to  `gprd` rails console\n1. Run `SubmitUsagePingService.new.execute` this will take more than 30 hours.\n1. Check the last payload in `raw_usage_data` table: `RawUsageData.last.payload`\n1. Check the when the payload was sent `RawUsageData.last.sent_at`\n\n\n```\nSubmitUsagePingService.new.execute\n\n# Get the payload\nRawUsageData.last.payload\n\n# Time when payload was sent to VersionsAppp\nRawUsageData.last.sent_at\n```\n\n## How to check Usage Ping in VersionsApp\n\n1. In versions app console RawUsageData.find(uuid: '')\n1. In Rails console, check the related `RawUsageData` object\n1. Or in VersionsApp UI https://version.gitlab.com/usage_data/usage_data_id\n\n```ruby\n\n/bin/herokuish procfile exec rails console\n\nputs UsageData.select(:recorded_at, :app_server_type).where(hostname: 'gitlab.com', uuid: 'ea8bf810-1d6f-4a6a-b4fd-93e8cbd8b57f').order('id desc').limit(5).to_json\n\nputs UsageData.find(21635202).raw_usage_data.payload.to_json\n```\n\n### Monitoring events tracked using Redis HLL \n\n\n### What to do if you get mentioned?\n\nIn this issue we keep the track of new metrics added to usage ping and metrics that are timing out.\n\nIf you get mentioned please check the failing metric and open an optimization issue.\n\n\n### Usage ping manual generation for GitLab.com schedule\n\n\n| Generation start date | developer GitLab handle | Link to Slack message\n| ------ | ------ | ----- |\n| 2021-02-18 | @alinamihaila | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1613726854310200 |\n| 2021-02-25 | @alinamihaila  | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1614232931043100 |\n| 2021-03-04 | @a_akgun  | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1614927407138300 |\n| 2021-03-11 | @a_akgun  | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1615543891202800 |\n| 2021-03-18 | @alinamihaila | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321996#note_532134120 |\n| 2021-03-25 | @mikolaj_wawrzyniak | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1616757756100100 |\n| 2021-04-1 | @alinamihaila  | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1617346102146600 |\n| 2021-04-8 | @a_akgun   | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1617986864201600 |\n| 2021-04-15 | @alinamihaila   | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1618504285269400 |\n| 2021-04-22 | @alinamihaila | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1619155915334000 |\n| 2021-05-06 | @alinamihaila  | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1620366530438300 |\n| 2021-05-12 | @alinamihaila  | https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL3A7GFPF/p1620921580463200 |\n\n\n\n@gitlab-org/growth/product-intelligence","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-17T06:45:41.793Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T14:24:28.525Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T06:52:18.154Z","closed_by":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"labels":["devops::growth","group::product intelligence"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},{"id":5365921,"username":"alinamihaila","name":"Alina Mihaila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5365921/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alinamihaila"}],"author":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4409816,"username":"a_akgun","name":"Alper Akgun","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4409816/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/a_akgun"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-06-17","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331083","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":3},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"3 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331083","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331083/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331083/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331083","relative":"#331083","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331083"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87167169,"iid":331076,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allowlist Wiki and README.md for Mermaid limits","description":"### Summary\n\nCurrent limitations on Mermaid rendering, 2K total characters per page OR 50 blocks, whichever happens first, helps in preventing a DoS attack on all pages where we can render GFM.\n\nThis is non-ideal for pages like Wikis where\n\n1.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

Create a `search` computed property to wrap the term's length logic (`searchTerm?.length \u003c MINIMUM_SEARCH_TERM_LENGTH ? '' : searchTerm`).\n1.

The same query exists in `merge_request_artifact_download.vue`. We only need to pass in the following props: `reportType`, `targetProjectFullPath`, and `mrIid`~~\n\n(The above step was removed because the apollo/graphql fetch logic lives in the child component. Turns out the parent component also needs access to the same data to figure out if the `v-if` that renders the child component is true. The child component won't mount and fetch the data until the parent container template has `v-if` true. So we have a circular dependency.\n\nThe way Apollo + Cache shares state between components without VueX is to share data with overlapping GraphQL queries. In this case, we have the same data consumed in the parent and child component. The child component is used elsewhere in the codebase as it's own component so passing in props doesn't make sense. I believe having the query in the parent and child component in this edge case is not bad code quality because this is the pattern Apollo Cache uses to share global state. The **cache** is the single source of truth even for components at different levels of being nested.\n\nBoth queries are the same, but the data is cached, so there is no performance hit of 2 roundtrip queries.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-14T22:31:46.497Z","updated_at":"2021-06-15T18:49:59.330Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T18:49:59.316Z","closed_by":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"labels":["AST Leadership","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","devops::secure","frontend","section::sec","secure:refinement-frontend","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"}],"author":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3252080,"username":"farias-gl","name":"Fernando.A","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3252080/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/farias-gl"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331025","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331025","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331025/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331025/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331025","relative":"#331025","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331025"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87111861,"iid":331021,"project_id":278964,"title":"Set report category correctly based on which analyzer is used","description":"### Problem\n\nThe `category` field in the security report is currently hard coded to \"API Fuzzing\".

duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe new Vulnerability Management feature that allows creating a Jira issue directly from a vulnerability record works perfectly with Jira Classic (\"Company-managed software\") projects. However, it looks like it does not work at all with Jira Next Gen (\"Team-managed software\") projects.\n\n[See this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ixmQ-GYeUfzou7bep_8qHXxdtb6lmTXn/view?usp=sharing) for a demo of the error behavior.\n\nOne relevant detail is the issue type list seems incorrect when configuring a Next Gen project on the GitLab side. The issue list is supposed to be dynamic. It returns the expected list for Classic projects. However, for Next Gen projects, the issues never match what is configured on the Jira side.\n\nThis seems directly related to what causes the error. The Jira issue IDs used for the available issue types on Next Gen projects all appear to be incorrect. The issue IDs seem to match those that are available when using Classic projects. This seems to be the cause of the error. If you manually update the URL of the new Jira issue after you get the error with a correct issue ID for a Next Gen project, it works as expected.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Configure and enable a Jira integration (`Settings` → `Integrations`) for your GitLab project.\n   1. Enter a `Jira project key` corresponding to a Next Gen Jira project.\n   1. Save changes or Test settings to make sure configuration is correct.\n1. Check the `Enable Jira issues creation from vulnerabilities` option.\n1. Hit the \"refresh\" button next to the `Jira issue types` dropdown\n   1. This should dynamically pull all configured issue types on the Jira project specified above.\n   1. Note that for Next Gen projects, the list likely will NOT accurately reflect the project's configured issue types if viewed in Jira's project settings\n1. Select any Jira issue type and Save changes.\n1. Go to `Security \u0026 Compliance` → `Vulnerability Report` for the same project.\n1. Click the vulnerability name/description on any vulnerability list entry to view the vulnerability record (details page).\n1. Click the `Create Jira issue` button to open a new window. Note the Jira error about invalid Issue type.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/matt_wilson/simply-simple-notes/ (ask @matt_wilson for access)\n\nTest Jira instance: https://gitlab-stage-protect.atlassian.net/\n\nIt is possible the wrong API call is being used to fetch the Jira Issue types. The following API call will return an array of configured Issue types for both Class and Next Gen projects:\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-projects/#api-rest-api-3-project-projectidorkey-get\n\nVerify this by seeing the results from two test projects:\n\n* Next Gen: https://gitlab-stage-protect.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/10002/\n* Classic: https://gitlab-stage-protect.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/10003/\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nTrying to create a Jira issue from a GitLab vulnerability when the configured Jira project is a Next Gen type always results in an error message that the issue type is invalid (see video).\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nCreating Jira issues from vulnerabilities should work the same for both Classic and Next Gen projects.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n[Video of the error behavior](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ixmQ-GYeUfzou7bep_8qHXxdtb6lmTXn/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on

right alongside your source code and pipelines. Convenient huh? Well what hasn't been convenient is that not all of the metadata from the package.json is available in the Package Registry user interface. That makes it hard to verify the package quickly, which is really what we want the UI to help with. \n\nWhile we are still working on making that data available in the API and searchable (read more about it in the epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5151), we thought a solid first iteration was to simply display the contents of the file in the UI. \n\nNow when you navigate to the package details page, you can view the contents of the `package.json` file right in the UI. \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWhen an npm package is uploaded to the GitLab Package Registry it includes a `package.json` which is packaged in a tar.gz file. The `package.json` contains important metadata for a given package. This data is used to validate that you are using the correct package or to verify that it was built correctly. However, only a limited subset of this data is currently displayed in the Package Registry UI. This makes it hard for node developers to verify their dependencies.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen an npm package is uploaded, the backend should pass a `metadata_file` to the front end, so the file can be displayed in the user interface. \n\n#### Data to extract \n(reference: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json\n\n| Metadata             |\n|--------------------------|\n| name                     |\n| version                  |\n| description              |\n| keywords                 |\n| homepage                 |\n| bugs                     |\n| license                  |\n| people                   |\n| people.author            |\n| people.author.name       |\n| people.author.email      |\n| people.author.url        |\n| people.contributor       |\n| people.contributor.name  |\n| people.contributor.email |\n| people.contributor.url   |\n| funding                  |\n| files                    |\n| main                     |\n| browser                  |\n| bin                      |\n| man                      |\n| directories              |\n| directories.lib          |\n| directories.bin          |\n| directories.man          |\n| directories.doc          |\n| directories.example      |\n| directories.test         |\n| repository               |\n| scripts                  |\n| config                   |\n| dependencies             |\n| engines                  |\n| engineStrict             |\n| os                       |\n| cpu                      |\n| preferGlobal             |\n| private                  |\n| publishConfig            |\n| ng-update   (needed by angular)             |","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-13T20:42:09.241Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T16:11:48.482Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T10:01:24.600Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","GitLab Free","Package:P1","backend","customer","devops::package","direction","group::package registry","npm Registry","package:active","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production","🍉"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":83,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":9,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330929","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330929","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330929/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330929/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#330929","relative":"#330929","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#330929"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7037,"epic":{"id":379185,"iid":7037,"title":"Key improvements for the npm registry","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7037","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87051610,"iid":330922,"project_id":278964,"title":"Logic for priority reindexing","description":"As described in the parent epic there are certain scenarios where we want to be able to rebuild an indexes in a more targeted fashion on GitLab.com: For example, we might have identified a pathology in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218410#note_571485758 and want to re-create the index.

Timezone that we want to present the timeline in. MVC options - either user's local time or UTC. Plan is to ask for feedback about this during solution validation. Our SRE team [prefers UTC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330901#note_603108775) so, that would probably be what we want to use for the MVC.\n2. Which bits of information we can easily pull into the timeline in both the short and longer terms. We assume it would be nice to have some alert and incident activity feed items (such as alert and incident start times and status changes) pulled into the feed automatically, but it would probably be better if we didn't have to automatically pull in all of the feed items, as not all will be relevant. We'll need some additional technical investigation into what's possible. If we can't easily distinguish between activity feed items, our SRE team is okay with all system notes being pulled in if need be, since they can easily be deleted.

For now, we'll consider this as being outside of the scope for the MVC but, it would also be nice to have a plan for this as the [SRE team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330901#note_603108775) would be very interested in this functionality being available.

We make so much of our site up-to-the-millisecond accurate, but not all information A) needs that accuracy or B) is important enough to add delay the user's overall experience for the sake of accuracy.\n\u003e \n\u003e Obviously, I'm not saying *literally* \"no more DB queries\" but I think we should take a long, hard look at the information we run around fetching from DB/Gitaly, and see what we can pre-generate, to target, say, the 90% use case of the information, or of information where inaccuracies caused by small delays is less meaningful.\n\u003e \n\u003e To do this, we would need to shift to thinking about our work from reactive to proactive generation, which *trends* towards an event-driven model.\n\u003e \n\u003e For example.. at the moment we create a merge request, we have a fair idea of all the various checks and rules that might prevent that MR from being mergeable. Why waste computational cycles rechecking the mergeability state of the MR with every page load, and instead default it to an \"unmergeable\" state and have workers, triggered by the event of MR creation, confirm their own subsystems as a \"go\" asynchronously? Why do so much work within the request cycle, when we can move it out-of-band? **Work we don't do is cheaper than work we do, but work we do that we don't make the user sit around waiting for is also pretty cheap.**\n\n\n# What's next?\n\nThis proposal gathered some support and seems like it could use some more investigation into its feasibility.\n\nNamely:\n\n* What are the heaviest operations in the MR that we can pre-calculate accurately?\n* Can we ensure updating/invalidating that calculation in a way that doesn't affect UX?\n* If it does affect UX, is it acceptable?\n* (please

As ~\"group::ecosystem\" are unlikely to complete it at present https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15847#note_422065412 we should remove it. \n\nNote, this service may get renamed to `Integrations::OpenProject` as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201855 simply to be able to delete the `project_services` directory.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe should revert https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28012, or if the MR is unrevertable, remove all of the relevant code.\n\nWe should also search through the codebase for `OpenProject` and `open_project` and clean up any references.\n\nWe should update the description of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15847 with this information and link to the original MR so in future, the work can be jump-started if a community contributor wishes to work on it.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-13T04:31:57.921Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:41:41.206Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T10:27:56.829Z","closed_by":{"id":1315742,"username":"arturoherrero","name":"Arturo Herrero","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1315742/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/arturoherrero"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","Community contribution","backend","database","devops::manage","good for new contributors","group::integrations","maintenance::refactor","section::dev","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},{"id":9588757,"username":"lenikadali","name":"Leni Kadali Mutungi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9588757/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lenikadali"}],"author":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330832","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330832","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330832/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330832/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#330832","relative":"#330832","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#330832"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":86991386,"iid":330827,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add created_at to the Billable Members API","description":"\u003c!-- This issue template can be used a great starting point for feature requests. The last section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab. --\u003e\n\n### Release notes \n\n\u003c!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). \" --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nGitlab.com customers have no way of understanding when a given user account was provisioned.\n\n### Proposal \n\nAdd the `created_at` field to the BillableMember entity and return as part of our billable members API resource.\n\n\n### Intended users\n\nWho will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write \"Unknown\" and fill this field in later.\n\nPersonas are described at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/\n* [Delaney (Development Team Lead)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)\n* [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)\n* [Sam (Security Analyst)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#sam-security-analyst)\n\n\n\u003c!--- Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/\n\nConsider adding related issues and epics to this issue. You can also reference the Feature Proposal Template (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md) for additional details to consider adding to this issue. Additionally, as a data oriented organization, when your feature exits planning breakdown, consider adding the `What does success look like, and how can we measure that?` section.\n\nOther sections to consider adding: \n\n### User experience goal\n\nWhat is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? \nFor example, \"The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to \u003cperform a specific task\u003e\"\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ \n\n\n### Further details\n\nInclude use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. \n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\u003c!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?\nConsider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\n* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members \n* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members\n* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members \n\n### Documentation\n\n See the Feature Change Documentation Workflow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#for-a-product-change\n\n* Add all known Documentation Requirements in this section. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html\n* If this feature requires changing permissions, update the permissions document. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html \n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nThis section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning \n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nDefine both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. \n\n### What is the type of buyer?\n\nWhat is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/\nIn which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers\n\n### Is this a cross-stage feature?\n\nCommunicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-13T01:43:54.929Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T18:35:14.912Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T08:33:36.005Z","closed_by":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"labels":["#field-fyi","GitLab Free","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","api","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","direction","documentation","group::utilization","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1850126,"iid":62,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:57:35.404Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T19:45:42.498Z","due_date":"2021-08-17","start_date":"2021-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/62"},"assignees":[{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"}],"author":{"id":4587943,"username":"jrreid","name":"Jamie Reid","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4587943/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jrreid"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330827","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330827","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330827/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330827/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#330827","relative":"#330827","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#330827"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4547,"epic":{"id":121875,"iid":4547,"title":"GitLab.com Billable Members List","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4547","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":86991382,"iid":330826,"project_id":278964,"title":"Add link to Jira configuration in Jira Issues sidebar popout","description":"### Proposal\n\nAdd a **Configuration** (or similar) item to the **Jira Issues** nav popout, that links to the Project-level Jira Configuration: \n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-05-13_at_11.11.28_am](/uploads/3aef58646639db36550ce59feee37f87/Screen_Shot_2021-05-13_at_11.11.28_am.png)\n\n### Why\n\nI found myself wanting to view/change the Jira configuration for my project, and was frustrated that there wasn't a link to do so from the **Jira**/**Jira Issues** nav item in the left sidebar.\n\nUsers whose Gitlab instance uses Group or Instance-level Jira configuration may want to change the configuration for an individual project, but have to navigate to a different nav item **Settings \u003e Integrations \u003e Jira** to do so.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61282) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature. If there is no risk that the feature affects usability or server loads, skip to the global rollout.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n  - [x] `/chatops run feature set merge_base_pipeline_for_metrics_comparison true`\n  - [x] Done, 12:54 ET https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1621616021275000\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61282) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61282) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `merge_base_pipeline_for_metrics_comparison` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61282) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set merge_base_pipeline_for_metrics_comparison false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-12T20:12:44.666Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:56:49.236Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T18:42:01.859Z","closed_by":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","devops::verify","feature flag","group::pipeline insights","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850113,"iid":60,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:55:07.714Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:17.749Z","due_date":"2021-06-17","start_date":"2021-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"}],"author":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":730684,"username":"drew","name":"drew stachon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59b7f2c95acd4a085d964f745ead6bdb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/drew"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330809","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":44,"completed_count":25},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"25 of 44 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330809","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330809/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330809/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#330809","relative":"#330809","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#330809"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":86976126,"iid":330807,"project_id":278964,"title":"Project Overview page: Make banners consistent","description":"### Problem to solve\n\n\u003c!--\nThe banners on the Project overview page are different sizes and the bottom one uses the wrong close (\"x\") pattern\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-05-12_at_1.53.05_PM](/uploads/0b998f22c5f76cfa75f1c66a4eb70314/Screen_Shot_2021-05-12_at_1.53.05_PM.png)\n--\u003e\n\nThe free trail banner does not look correct.\n\n### Proposed solution\nWe will update the trial banner to use our [banner Vue component](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-banner--default).

[`Projects::DependenciesController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/35644c23da3/ee/app/controllers/projects/dependencies_controller.rb#L9-9)\n   1.

[`Projects::LicensesController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/35644c23da3/ee/app/controllers/projects/licenses_controller.rb#L10-10)\n   1. [`API::ManagedLicenses`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/35644c23da3/ee/lib/api/managed_licenses.rb#L7)\n\n1. Ensure that there are no other security controllers that have an incorrectly configured [feature category](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_categorization/index.html#feature-categorization)\n1. Update any secure Sidekiq workers to ensure they're assigned the correct [feature category](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_categorization/index.html#feature-categorization)\n1.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature. If there is no risk that the feature affects usability or server loads, skip to the global rollout.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n  - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e

Report","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nWe want to allow customers to collect vulnerabilities from images in running Kubernetes clusters so they can understand their current security risk not only for images that are scanned as a part of CI Pipeline, but also for images that were deployed without using GitLab CI.\n\nYou can find more about our motivation to work on this issue [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3410#problem-to-solve).\n\nThis issue is about extending front-end components to support new Report Type (`cluster_image_scanning`), so we can differentiate vulnerabilities found in Container Scanning from those found in Cluster Image Scanning.\n\n## Relevant links\n- [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3410)\n- [Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219173) (**NOTE.** In this issue we will not implement designs proposed in Design Issue, but we will simply allow users to see and filter Vulnerabilities with new Report type)\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [x] Documentation: add documentation and information about new report type here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/\n- [-] Feature flag: no feature flag is needed as this is something that users will optionally select by including the GitLab CI template\n- [-] Performance:\n- [x] Testing:\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- [x] Add `Cluster Image Scanning` as a dropdown option for the scanner filter by adding it to the `REPORT_TYPES` contant in [constants.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/security_dashboard/store/constants.js#L14).\n- [x] Expand the width of the scanner filter dropdown so that the `Cluster Image Scanning` option does not get text truncated.\n- [x] Create a new project or modify the [security-reports example project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports) to return `cluster-image-scanning` results.\n- [x] Write tests if necessary (existing tests may already cover what's needed).\n- [x] Verify that the vulnerability list properly filters the `cluster-image-scanning` results when the dropdown option is selected.\n- [x] Verify that the vulnerability list properly displays \"Sorry, your filter produced no results\" when there are no `cluster-image-scanning` results.\n- [x] **Important:** Verify that the option for `cluster-image-scanning` filters properly on the **pipeline security tab**.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-12T09:39:30.297Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T16:59:48.749Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T16:59:48.726Z","closed_by":{"id":8401507,"username":"sashi_kumar","name":"Sashi

After vulnerability reports are fetched from Kubernetes cluster, analyzer has to parse and convert found vulnerabilities to format supported in GitLab (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas).\n\nValue for `KUBECONFIG` variable will be provided from GitLab CI as predefined variable when Project is connected to Kubernetes cluster or as a variable provided manually by user in `Project-\u003eSettings-\u003eCI Variables`.\n\nThere is no preference about the technology used in this analyzer (either Go or Ruby will work for us), however ideally (since we want to extend `kas` in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330716, which is written in Go) we want to go with Go language to reuse this logic later in Kubernetes Agent.\n\n## Relevant links\n- [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3410)\n- [Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219173)\n- [Proof of concept](https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski/live-container-scanning)\n\n\n## Non-functional requirements\n\u003c!--\nAdd details for required items and delete others.\n--\u003e\n\n- [ ] Documentation: should be added to document usage of new analyzer\n- [-] Feature flag: no feature flag is needed as this is something that users will optionally select by including the GitLab CI template\n- [-] Performance:\n- [ ] Testing:\n  - Test if you can fetch vulnerabilities from kubernetes cluster and prepare JSON report with them in GitLab format,\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n1. ~backend create new project in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers and prepare analyzer that will fetch vulnerabilities from Kubernetes cluster for credentials provided in `KUBECONFIG` environment variable\n2. ~documentation add README and documentation to document usage of new analyzer,","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-12T08:37:42.348Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T07:09:45.504Z","closed_at":"2021-07-07T20:10:23.699Z","closed_by":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"},"labels":["Category:Container Scanning","Deliverable","GitLab Ultimate","automation:ml","automation:ml wrong","backend","devops::govern","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"}],"author":{"id":5535431,"username":"mparuszewski","name":"Alan (Maciej) Paruszewski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5535431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mparuszewski"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":8953999,"username":"bwill","name":"Brian Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8953999/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bwill"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330710","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330710","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330710/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/330710/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#330710","relative":"#330710","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#330710"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3410,"epic":{"id":59230,"iid":3410,"title":"Cluster Image Scanning (Vulnerability Scans against Running Containers)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3410","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 13, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":86919544,"iid":330708,"project_id":278964,"title":"Abstract out DAST Profiles Summary to new components","description":"The DAST Profile summaries are currently part of On-demand Scans form\n\n### Proposal\n\nTo abstract out summary from DAST On-demand Scans form to a dedicated component and make it reusable\n\n### Implemention\n\n- [x] Create `DastScannerProfileSummary` component\n   -

the best trade-off. A data consistency `delayed` could cause the job to be rescheduled if the replica hasn't caught up, but the worker is set to run with `urgency :high` so we want to avoid that. A `sticky` mode still allows us to use replica as much as possible.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-11T23:57:58.112Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:42:29.430Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T08:36:17.433Z","closed_by":{"id":4087087,"username":"alipniagov","name":"Aleksei
