But the Guest user can use the Approvals API to approve/unapprove the merge request even after the User is demoted to Guest. This API also leaks the Merge request details which the guest user is not supposed to view.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n- Created a new Project with private access  \n- Created a new file in master branch (Made some changes )  \n- Invited a user with a maintainer role.  \n- From the maintainer role account created a new branch named test, made some changes.  \n- After that from project admin account I created a Merge request with source branch as test and target branch as master.  \n- Assigned that merge request to the maintainer role access user.  \n- After creating the merge request, from project admin account demoted the maintainer role user to Guest role  \n- From demoted user account I created a personal access token with all the available scopes selected  \n- Using API client sent a POST request to the approvals endpoint    \n   Sample endpoint:   \n     - https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/26669301/merge_requests/1/unapprove  \n     - https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/26669301/merge_requests/1/approve  \n- This API endpoint will respond with 201 status with the merge request details which the Guest user is not supposed to approve and view. \n\n#####  Impact  \nDemoted users can approve the merge requests created by them and can view the confidential data of those merge requests once their role revoked. This leads to sensitive info disclosure to unauthorised users\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nDemoted users can approve the merge requests created by them and can view the confidential data of those merge requests once their role is revoked\n\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nDemoted users should be blocked from  approving the merge requests created by them and viewing  the confidential data of those merge requests once their role is revoked \n\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nDemoted users can approve the merge requests created by them and can view the confidential data of those merge requests once their role revoked.

The `gradle` implementation is left to this issue.\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nNote: adoptopenjdk-16.0.0+36 was already added in.\n* [x] update `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` to remove deprecated functionality (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329805)\n* [x] add java16 branch to [java-gradle test project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/java-gradle) to change the distribution url to point to gradle 7\n* [x] add test for java 16 using gradle\n* [x] release new version of gemnasium-maven\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [x] support for java 16 to be documented under `DS_JAVA_VERSION` row of [DS analyzer configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-specific-analyzers-used-by-dependency-scanning).\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nAdd java 16 job for each supported framework as in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L58\n\n* [x] java-gradle","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-22T02:34:48.979Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T13:56:34.712Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T14:30:10.143Z","closed_by":{"id":52092,"username":"gonzoyumo","name":"Olivier Gonzalez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/651e0ff81c3995a05269f7c80895fe89?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gonzoyumo"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","backend","devops::secure","documentation","group::composition analysis","release post item","release post item::in review","section::sec","type::maintenance","workflow::canary"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"}],"author":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4668304,"username":"ifrenkel","name":"Igor Frenkel","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a73e8113c53ac25297ce751e59bbb1d3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ifrenkel"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331652","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":6},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331652","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331652/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331652/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331652","relative":"#331652","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331652"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":87532179,"iid":331649,"project_id":278964,"title":"[issue_boards_filtered_search] Enable gl-filtered-search on issue boards","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the feature](ISSUE LINK) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `issue_boards_filtered_search` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: group::plan\n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#s_plan`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @fguibert\n- PM: @cdybenko \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Partial Rollout on GitLab.com with testing groups\n- Rollout on GitLab.com for a certain period (How long)\n- Percentage Rollout on GitLab.com\n- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), enable it on GitLab.com for [testing groups/projects](#testing-groupsprojectsusers).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --\u003cactor-type\u003e=\u003cactor\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Cross-post chatops slack command to `#support_gitlab-com`.\n  ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)) and in your team channel\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the above MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

It seems like there are platforms that don't necessarily expose URLs ending with .git.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Create an account at xp-dev.com (they have 30 days trial with no credit card information) - \u003e Create a test project \n1. Try importing that project to GitLab using Import by URL feature.\n1. Unable to find a way to get a URL ending with `.git`\n\n## Proposed solution\nA 3-step solution was proposed in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331641#note_583624896):\n1. Revert current MR (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331803)\n2. **Switch from \"error message\" to \"warning\" (this issue)**\n3. Switch from \"dummy error message\" to making real backend-based validation \"if the supplied URL feels like GIT url\" (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331641). \n\nThis issue implements step 2:\nWhen the URL doesn't end with `.git`, show a warning, similar to the original solution. To do that, we should add a validation to the URL field that would fail unless the URL ends in `.git` upon clicking on the `Create project` button.

Now, we are going to change the [primary identifier](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e4eb9c66d5d0b7daea516d94141743f5cb759cfd/ee/app/models/vulnerabilities/finding.rb#L339) of [semgrep](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep) to [bandit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bandit) identifier. Now, after triggering a pipeline in the new MR, we will notice that the same `semgrep` finding has been attributed as `fixed` and `added`. In order to resolve this issue, we need to use [secondary identifier matching](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c2d59c4fd9129dbd812d8a23aa67212a18bdda1d/ee/lib/gitlab/ci/reports/security/vulnerability_reports_comparer.rb#L110)\n\nWe need to perform the matching in `StoreReportService` in order to do the actual remapping during persisting different finding. Following is an except from this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299589#note_596064370).\n\n\u003e Most of the solution seems focused on `VulnerabilityReportsComparer` but that service is only used for displaying the diff within the UI, not for the actual remapping that must be done within `StoreReportService`. We should be sure to update that worker in order to persist different findings rather than only show the diff within the UI.\n\n### Summary\nWe need to find a solution using secondary matching in `StoreReportService` rather than `VulnerabilityReportsComparer`. This will help us to eliminate the burden of matching in displaying diff in UI. In this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299589#note_596064370), we talked about performance issues as well.

MR widget link should be replaced with a button","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nThis MR widget should use a download button in place of the `Download scanned resources` link shown below:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-05-20_at_11.40.35_AM](/uploads/62d072a925d9bfd64d83ffb372dec955/Screen_Shot_2021-05-20_at_11.40.35_AM.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\n**TLDR:** Update both buttons to the [`Small button`](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#sizing) component\n\nIn order to provide users with a consistent experience while interacting with the security merge request widget, all similar actions within the subgroup headers (e.g. SAST, DAST, Coverage fuzzing, etc.) should utilize the same Pajamas Components. \n\nFor this specific issue, the [`Small button`](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#sizing) component is likely the best candidate to align on since it will ensure all of the subgroup headers remain a consistent size and allows for the security widget's primary actions (e.g. View full report \u0026 Expand/Collapse) to maintain their prominence. \n\nIn addition to updating the button styles, the `download` icon used on the Coverage fuzzing button should also be removed. [As stated in the Pajamas documentation](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#dropdown-buttons) for dropdown buttons:\n\n\u003e The chevron is the only icon that should be present with a text label.\n\n| Current State | Proposed State |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Security_Widget_-_SubGroupAcitons_-_Current](/uploads/270d120b2ec336b44e8a52bca3426629/Security_Widget_-_SubGroupAcitons_-_Current.png) | ![Security_Widget_-_SubGroupAcitons_-_Proposed](/uploads/4695bf42709bf414ba488c43acc90699/Security_Widget_-_SubGroupAcitons_-_Proposed.png) |\n\n## Proposal Update\n\nThere were some changes to the Design during UX-Review for consistency reasons https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63407#note_594698779\n\n| proposal update |\n| ------ |\n| ![Screenshot_2021-06-08_at_16.19.52](/uploads/5a4d7b525c970234a1a63abe26551f90/Screenshot_2021-06-08_at_16.19.52.png)|\n\n\n\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [ ] Update DAST widget\n  - [ ] Replace `GlLink` with `GlButton` component in [`grouped_security_reports_app.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/c4ce7dfd0b5d56f8f1390139eeb999b726d030d2/ee/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/security_reports/grouped_security_reports_app.vue#L610)\n  - [ ] Add `size` attribute as `sm`\n- [ ] Update Coverage Fuzzing Widget\n  - [ ] Remove `icon` attribute from  [`security_report_download_dropdown.vue`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/254a5576a738591d33692f9ed7fda5c0a933bb78/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/security_reports/components/security_report_download_dropdown.vue#L36)\n  - [ ] Update `size` attribute as `sm`\n\ncc @derekferguson","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-20T16:48:29.347Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T15:08:53.165Z","closed_at":"2021-06-22T13:13:06.265Z","closed_by":{"id":7293390,"username":"jannik_lehmann","name":"Jannik Lehmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7293390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jannik_lehmann"},"labels":["Category:DAST","UX debt","devops::secure","frontend","group::dynamic analysis","priority::3","section::sec","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":1850118,"iid":61,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-26T16:56:41.887Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:22.879Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":7293390,"username":"jannik_lehmann","name":"Jannik Lehmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7293390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jannik_lehmann"}],"author":{"id":4415483,"username":"beckalippert","name":"Becka Lippert","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4415483/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/beckalippert"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7293390,"username":"jannik_lehmann","name":"Jannik Lehmann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7293390/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jannik_lehmann"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331534","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 6 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331534","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331534/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331534/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331534","relative":"#331534","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331534"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87444587,"iid":331523,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate vertical sharding of merge requests data","description":"In https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5883 we are looking into vertically sharding our database.

of projects with compliance framework do not include local changes","description":"### Summary\n\nPipelines of projects with compliance framework do not include local changes.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a Compliance CI template in the Compliance project\n```yml\ncompliance_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo \"Performing compliance build steps\"\n\ninclude:\n  - project: '$CI_PROJECT_PATH'\n    file: '$CI_CONFIG_PATH'\n\n```\n2. Create a Compliance framework (e.g `SOX`) and associate with the Compliance CI template\n3. Assign the Compliance framework to a Developer project\n4. Add a CI template to the Developer project\n```yml\ntest_job:\n  stage: test\n  script:\n    - echo \"Performing test steps\"\n```\n5. Create an MR that modifies the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the developer's project.\n6. Observe that the pipeline in the MR uses the Compliance CI template `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defined in the default branch's `.gitlab-ci.yml` and ignores any changes made in the MR.\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/sam-s-test-group/expressexample/-/merge_requests/3\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nCI template changes on the Developer project are clobbered and replaced with the Compliance CI template.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPipelines on the Developer projects should reflect changes on the target branch. In other words, we should see the merged CI pipeline.\n\n```yml\ncompliance_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo \"Performing compliance build steps\"\n\ntest_job:\n  stage: test\n  script:\n    - echo \"Performing test steps\"\n```\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nLooking closer at the pipeline config source, it seems that the `include` section introduced by the Compliance framework clobbered the local content.\n\nInstead of this,\n\n```yml\ninclude:\n  -

`database.yml` instead of custom `database_geo.yml`\n- [ ] Use `connects_to` to make Geo models use the tracking database instead of `def self.connection` override in `Geo::TrackingBase`\n- [ ] Use `connected_to` block to manually use the tracking database instead of `Gitlab::Geo::DatabaseTasks#set_db_env`\n- [ ] Deprecate custom `rake geo:db:*` rake tasks in favor of built-in tasks `rake db:*:geo`\n- [ ] Make sure the changes are [backwards compatible across updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/multi_version_compatibility.html)\n\n## References\n\n-

`open_merge_requests_count` is not updated immediately after the merge request is replicated.\n\nWorkarounds:\n\n- Run `sudo gitlab-rake cache:clear` on the Secondary. This clears cache at instance level.\n- To just refer the `open_merge_requests_count` cache, run the following in Rails console:\n\n```ruby\np = Project.find(1) # Replace 1 with project ID \ncache = Projects::OpenMergeRequestsCountService.new(p)\ncache.refresh_cache # refresh cache\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a project\n- Create a merge request\n- Visit the project page on the Geo secondary site\n- The badge on Merge Requests in the left nav bar is 0 but should be 1\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIt takes 20 minutes to refresh/update the cache.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nCache should refresh/update immediately after the MR is replicated.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs -

An external user with maintainer permissions could create a project token, which will be connected to a bot user with internal privileges on the GitLab instance. Thus, now being able to access all internal projects and snippets as a Guest user. This includes\n\n* Accessing all information about internal projects as if having Guest permissions (including source code)  \n* Creating issues on internal projects  \n* Creating projects and groups (these will contain no members and thus be of little use)\n\nAn external user is by the documentation described as a way to let external contractors get access to limited parts of a GitLab instance [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#external-users). Stating that  \n```  \nThis feature may be useful when for example a contractor is working on a given project and should only have access to that project.  \n```  \nThere are no warnings about giving an external user maintainer permissions. It is also possible for ANY internal user to elevate the external user to maintainer on any internal project created by that user. Thus, there is no need to ask an Admin for permission to do this. Thus, an external user (if not already granted maintainer on a project) only needs to convince one other user on the system to create a project and invite the external user as maintainer. \n\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a user with \"external user\" activated  \n2. Use any internal user to invite the \"external user\" as maintainer to a project  \n3. Login as the \"external user\" and create a project token on the project, save the token  \n4. Use the token to probe internal projects  \n```  \n curl --header \"Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects\"  \n```  \ncreate groups  \n```  \n curl -X POST --header \"Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/groups?name=newg\u0026path=newgroup\"  \n```  \ncreate issues on internal projects  \n```  \ncurl -X POST --header \"Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/21/issues?title=iWasHere\"   \n```  \naccess source code  \n```  \ncurl --header \"Authorization: Bearer \u003cTOKEN\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/19/repository/blobs/83d9398518bdf1519b7b8fbbb3fa3e305a8554ef/raw\"  \n```\n\n#####  Impact\n\nAn external user can access all internal projects. Thus leading to severe information disclosure and ability to interact by issues. \n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAn external user with maintainer privileges to a project can create a project token which is connected to a Bot with internal access.\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe bot should not have internal access to the GitLab instance. It is stated that  \n```  \nProject access tokens are scoped to a project and can be used to authenticate with the GitLab API.  \n```  \n[link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html)  \nWhich makes it seam like the token does not have any permissions outside the project.  \nThe bot should probably have \"external privilege\" as standard. At least an external user should not be able to use the bot to access internal projects.\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n```  \nSystem information  \nSystem:\t\t  \nCurrent User:\tgitlab  \nUsing RVM:\tno  \nRuby Version:\t3.0.1p64  \nGem Version:\t/usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/spec_set.rb:86:in `block in materialize': Could not find rake-13.0.3 in any of the sources (Bundler::GemNotFound)  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/spec_set.rb:80:in `map!'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/spec_set.rb:80:in `materialize'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/definition.rb:170:in `specs'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/definition.rb:237:in `specs_for'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/definition.rb:226:in `requested_specs'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/runtime.rb:101:in `block in definition_method'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/runtime.rb:20:in `setup'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler.rb:149:in `setup'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/setup.rb:20:in `block in \u003ctop (required)\u003e'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/ui/shell.rb:136:in `with_level'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/ui/shell.rb:88:in `silence'  \n\tfrom /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/bundler/setup.rb:20:in `\u003ctop (required)\u003e'  \n\tfrom \u003cinternal:/usr/lib/ruby/3.0.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb\u003e:85:in `require'  \n\tfrom \u003cinternal:/usr/lib/ruby/3.0.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb\u003e:85:in `require'  \nBundler Version:unknown  \nRake Version:\t13.0.3  \nRedis Version:\t6.2.3  \nGit Version:\t2.31.1  \nSidekiq Version:5.2.9  \nGo Version:\tgo1.16.4 linux/amd64\n\nGitLab information  \nVersion:\t13.10.4  \nRevision:\te11cc45d59e  \nDirectory:\t/usr/share/webapps/gitlab  \nDB Adapter:\tPostgreSQL  \nDB Version:\t13.2  \nURL:\t\thttp://gitlab.joaxcar.com  \nHTTP Clone URL:\thttp://gitlab.joaxcar.com/some-group/some-project.git  \nSSH Clone URL:\tgitlab@gitlab.joaxcar.com:some-group/some-project.git  \nUsing LDAP:\tno  \nUsing Omniauth:\tyes  \nOmniauth Providers: \n\nGitLab Shell  \nVersion:\t13.17.0  \nRepository storage paths:  \n- default: \t/var/lib/gitlab/repositories  \nGitLab Shell path:\t\t/usr/share/webapps/gitlab-shell  \nGit:\t\t/usr/bin/git  \n```\n\n####  Impact\n\nAn external user can access all internal projects.

You can view this data in the [Package adoption and growth dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/805350/Package:-User-Adoption-and-Growth). There are several events that are defined that we are not collecting data for. For some events, like [container registry events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60541#note_567965755), this is expected. \n\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe problem is that we are not currently collecting any data for generic packages. This data should be available as we can see that the feature is being used. As a PM, this data would help me to prioritize between generic packages and other product features. In addition, seeing deploy token and guest usage would be informative for prioritization and design decisions.\n\n#### Impacted metrics\n\n- `counts.package_events_i_package_generic_delete_package`\n- `counts.package_events_i_package_generic_pull_package`\n- `counts.package_events_i_package_generic_push_package`\n- `redis_hll_counters.user_packages.i_package_generic_user_weekly`\n- `redis_hll_counters.user_packages.i_package_generic_user_monthly`\n- `redis_hll_counters.deploy_token_packages.i_package_generic_deploy_token_weekly`\n- `redis_hll_counters.deploy_token_packages.i_package_generic_deploy_token_monthly`\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nInvestigate why generic package activity is not working with the usage ping. Fix the issue and add any relevant charts to the Package adoption dashboard.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-19T19:53:38.257Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T14:30:35.876Z","closed_at":"2021-08-20T13:25:41.397Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Generic Package Repository","Package:P2","Stretch","backend","devops::package","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"}],"author":{"id":3799560,"username":"trizzi","name":"Tim Rizzi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3799560/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/trizzi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve Abrams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cac831f7b515c191dfba32c54f01c375?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sabrams"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331455","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331455","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331455/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331455/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331455","relative":"#331455","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331455"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":2289,"epic":{"id":15774,"iid":2289,"title":"Delicious data (package)","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2289","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87388649,"iid":331449,"project_id":278964,"title":"Improve browser Total Blocking Time (TBT) performance of Project Files Tree page into S2 tier","description":"The Project Files Tree page's browser Total Blocking Time (TBT) performance is unperformant:\n\n```\n* Environment:                10k\n* Environment Version:        15.0.0-pre `bb46288cf63`\n* Date:                       2022-05-10\n\nNAME                                  | FCP (ms) | LCP (ms)       | TBT (ms)         | SI (ms) | LVC (ms) | TFR SIZE (kb) | SCORE | RESULT\n--------------------------------------|----------|----------------|------------------|---------|----------|---------------|-------|-------\nweb_project_files                     | 985      | ✓ 1687 (\u003c2500) | ✘ 9983 (\u003c9000)   | 1258    | 6550     | 432.2         | 67    | FAILED\n```\n\n[The Project Files Tree page being tested can be seen here on Staging](https://staging.gitlab.com/gpt/large_projects/gitlabhq1/-/tree/master/spec/lib/gitlab).

Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n- Create a git repository anywhere outside your GitLab instance\n  - For example, on GitHub, or on a different GitLab instance (such as GitLab.com if using Self-Managed, or vice-versa)\n- Push some initial LFS files to the repository, with a file size above 1.0 MiB\n\n```\ngit lfs track *.big\ngit add .gitattributes\ngit commit -m \"add lfs tracking entry\"\n\n# Creates a 1.1 MiB file\ndd if=/dev/random of=file1.big bs=1024 count=1100\ngit add file1.big\ngit commit -m \"add file1 to lfs\"\n\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n- Setup a mirroring of this repository in your GitLab.com or SM GitLab instance.\n  - Choose new project, \"Run CI/CD for external repository\" to do this.\n  - You can use either GitHub integration, or Repo by URL, the source does not matter.\n\n- Wait for the initial import to complete. Try to download the LFS `file1.big` file from repo UI. It works/downloads/carries data.\n\n- Now go back to the external source repo. Add another LFS file and push. File size does not matter now.\n\n```\n# Creates a 10 MiB file\ndd if=/dev/random of=file2.big bs=1024 count=10000\ngit add file2.big\ngit commit -m \"add file2 to lfs\"\n\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n- Wait for the mirror repo to complete fetching the new changes\n\n- Observe that the following error appears in the `update_mirror_service_json.log`:\n\n```\n{\"severity\":\"ERROR\",\"time\":\"2021-05-19T07:53:08.653Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"01F61STA29DWG7RS7XBXCE2RX4\",\"user_id\":1,\"project_id\":33,\"import_url\":\"https://:*****@gitlab.com/group/project.git\",\"error_message\":\"Validation failed: Lfs object already exists in repository\"}\n```\n\n- Observe that the repo UI now shows the `file2.big` file, but if you attempt to download it, it fails with a 404.\n\n- Repeat the steps above to add as many new regular or LFS files, and observe that none of the new LFS files' actual data are being downloaded automatically anymore\n\n- Only the first LFS file, present during initial import, is present/downloadable\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\nFile `file12.big` on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/hchouraria/lfs-downloads-fail\n\n404: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/hchouraria/lfs-downloads-fail/-/raw/main/file12.big\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nNo new LFS files added to source repo are downloaded by the mirror automatically\nNew LFS files in the repo do not download in CI/CD, and return 404 on the UIs when downloaded\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nAll new LFS files added to source repo must be downloaded by the mirror automatically\nNew LFS files in the repo must be available to CI/CD and downloads on the UIs\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n```\n{\"severity\":\"ERROR\",\"time\":\"2021-05-19T07:53:08.653Z\",\"correlation_id\":\"01F61STA29DWG7RS7XBXCE2RX4\",\"user_id\":1,\"project_id\":33,\"import_url\":\"https://:*****@gitlab.com/group/project.git\",\"error_message\":\"Validation failed: Lfs object already exists in repository\"}\n```\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n\u003c!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. --\u003e\n\nThe issue is in file `app/services/projects/lfs_pointers/lfs_download_service.rb` on line:\n\n```\nreturn link_existing_lfs_object! if lfs_size \u003e LARGE_FILE_SIZE \u0026\u0026 lfs_object\n```\n\n- When the LFS object list is retrieved, all the existing OIDs are part of the list.\n- We try to perform a `link_existing_lfs_object!` for one such pre-existing file.\n- But this fails with the object validation error, because a record for an `LfsObjectsProject` model already exists\n- The exception thrown breaks the entire download loop and aborts\n- No file beyond the first (repeated) OID is processed\n- No new LFS files end up being truly downloaded\n\nThe only workarounds I can think of are rather impractical:\n\n- Setup the mirror when there are no pre-existing LFS files in the source repo (or)\n- Ensure no pre-existing LFS file is above 1 MiB ever (even in history of the repo)\n\nThis bug effectively breaks use of LFS with mirroring options (using GitLab as the CI/CD endpoint for external repos being the use-case) so it is pretty severe for those that already have been using LFS on their source systems.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-19T08:53:15.221Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T08:19:13.105Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T09:54:49.847Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor

sidebar component with the `sidebar_assignees_widget`","description":"## History\n\n- As part of the creation of the [Threat Monitoring Alert page](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5041), I created a sidebar that allowed the user to [assignee users to an alert](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331010), exactly like in the alert details page. \n- When looking to reuse the [sidebar assignee component built by the monitor team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/alert_details/components/sidebar/sidebar_assignees.vue), I found [an assignee widget](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sidebar/components/assignees/sidebar_assignees_widget.vue) had been built to be used for issues, MRs, and epics, which [works great for alerts as well](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61839).\n\n![Screen_Shot_2021-05-18_at_3.31.19_PM](/uploads/f845bd37f4027cdd6545444121629113/Screen_Shot_2021-05-18_at_3.31.19_PM.png)\n\n## Motivation\n- Moving the alert details sidebar to use the GitLab standard `sidebar_assignee_widget` will reduce dev time necessary to maintain the currently used `sidebar_assignees` component if any bugs arise or any changes occur on a GitLab-level styling\n\n## Implementation\n- [ ] follow https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61839 in swapping out the component\n- [ ] delete the [sidebar assignee component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/alert_details/components/sidebar/sidebar_assignees.vue) and any children\n- [ ] delete the component-specific graphql queries created in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61839\n- [ ] delete any related tests\n- [ ] remove `assignees` from the [alert fragment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/graphql_shared/fragments/alert.fragment.graphql) and add it to the [get_alerts query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/graphql_shared/queries/get_alerts.query.graphql)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-18T21:47:18.043Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T04:43:25.239Z","closed_at":"2022-09-20T04:43:25.220Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander

This will create a gap in the experience for users that would like to make a change to the number of seats or tier, to take effect on renewal day.\n\nCustomers who are not on auto-renew will still have the ability to manually renew 15 days prior to the end of their subscription term. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342971\n\nFor SaaS - we currently will auto-renew you based on Billable users, which can be lower or higher than what you purchased. Customer might want predictability at renewal so they would want to specify # of seats to renew at.\n\nHere's a [ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/249674) that shows the need for this functionality.\n\n### Proposal\n\n30 days before the renewal date:\n1. Allow customer to upgrade Plan tier\n1. Allow customer to increase number of users higher than number of active users\n1. Allow customer to increase or decrease amount of storage subscription (iterative approach)\n   1. MVC iteration (which is exactly what we're doing today) - do not allow editing of the storage section and they would automatically renew for exactly the storage they had last year.\n   1. Add an info banner to let them know they need to check their Storage usage before changing this, with a link to storage usage page.\n   1. Final: Check storage usage and make the quantity selector intelligent.\n1. Allow customer to update billing address and payment method\n1. No payment will be taken when the customer manages their autorenewal, payment will process on the autorenewal date\n\n**Note:** Customers can cancel autorenew up until 30 days from subscription renewal date. Once 30 days is passed, we will allow them to start making modifications to their autorenew.\n\n### Design\n\n**Important note:** This issue only covers the management of the autorenewal. The subscriptions \u0026 purchases page (which is where the customer will enter the manage autorenewal flow) will be handled in a [separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333823). The subscriptions \u0026 purchases page that you'll see at the beginning of the flow is a wireframe for placeholder purposes only.\n\n- :clapper: [Walkthrough video](https://www.loom.com/share/2659c7bd0a81454aa60ba765e985554e)\n- :mouse2: [Clickable prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/Ql1Cqokfkq5b9bjUAra54F/Subscription-management-in-GitLab.com?page-id=607%3A1998\u0026node-id=727%3A3200\u0026viewport=501%2C48%2C0.13\u0026scaling=min-zoom\u0026starting-point-node-id=727%3A3200)\n- :eyes: See design section for detailed screens and use cases not covered in the video/prototype\n\n### Next steps\n\n[Solution validation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342972)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-18T21:39:31.174Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T13:41:58.002Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T21:44:39.301Z","closed_by":{"id":4377833,"username":"esybrant","name":"Emily Sybrant","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4377833/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/esybrant"},"labels":["Category:Purchase","Technical Writing","UI text","UX","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::purchase","missed:14.4","section::fulfillment","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":2114817,"iid":66,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T04:59:45.082Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:45.431Z","due_date":"2021-11-17","start_date":"2021-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/66"},"assignees":[{"id":4377833,"username":"esybrant","name":"Emily Sybrant","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4377833/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/esybrant"}],"author":{"id":4377833,"username":"esybrant","name":"Emily Sybrant","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4377833/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/esybrant"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4377833,"username":"esybrant","name":"Emily Sybrant","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4377833/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/esybrant"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331320","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331320","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331320/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/331320/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#331320","relative":"#331320","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#331320"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6970,"epic":{"id":374918,"iid":6970,"title":"Allow customers to change subscription before auto-renewal","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6970","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87311385,"iid":331315,"project_id":278964,"title":"GithubImporter: Optimize Pull Request Review Importer","description":"## Problem\n\nThe Github API does not provide a way to fetch all the pull requests reviews of a project (repo), like it provides for comments, instead we have to fetch the reviews by Pull Request.\n\nFor this reason, the `Gitlab::GithubImport::Importer::PullRequestsReviewsImporter`¹ have to iterate over the imported pull requests and for each one do request the reviews, which might be more than one page. \n\nIf the importer hits a rate limit, the process restarts, and the imported pull requests are skipped², but the importer goes over all the review pages again.\n\nIn other words, for some projects with large number of pull requests and large number of reviews per pull request, we might end up with duplicated reviews and unnecessary API requests, which would lead to longer importing times.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\n- To avoid duplicated comments, besides caching the Pull Requests ids, also cache the review ids and skip the already processed ones.\n- To avoid unnecessary API requests, use the `PageCounter` to only request pages that weren't yet imported.\n\n### Reference\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48632 - First version of the Pull Requests reviews importer\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60668 - Skip already imported Pull Requests reviews\n1.

However, at the end of the month the data could feel stale so under https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/289856 we modified DevOps Adoption to have a perspective of \"current calendar month\".  Now, however, at the beginning of the month the data could feel misleading (because it might only look at a few days of activity).  Under https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329708 we discussed changing to a perspective of \"past 30 days\" which would be updated daily.

disabled input for Service Desk custom email with help text when not configured","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Proposal \n\n\nIn the Project Settings \u003e General \u003e Service Desk UI, make the `custom suffix` section visible, but with a disabled input and a [suggestion to configure service_desk_email](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk.html#using-custom-email-address) when the user does not have `service_desk_email` configured.\n\n\n### Background\n\nCurrently users are confused about the `service_desk_email` configuration section. Many think it's required for setting up Service Desk in general, when that's done using the `incoming_email` section, and wonder why Service Desk isn't working properly when it's configured.\n\nSimilarly, when they _do_ have `incoming_email` configured (but not `service_desk_email`) they don't see the custom email [address portion of the UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/295640). It is simply hidden from view with no guidance or help.\n\nThis change makes it visible and points the user to the documentation where they can learn more.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Summarize the bug encountered concisely. --\u003e\n\n\u003e ![Screen_Shot_2021-05-17_at_8.59.03_AM](/uploads/0a7556054957aa1ab45b0d2863461f63/Screen_Shot_2021-05-17_at_8.59.03_AM.png)\n\nThe license compliance capability is inappropriately blocking users from merging. This is a similar issue to what our security compliance capability suffered [prior to 13.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222643).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Deny one of the licenses existing on the default branch.\n1. Turn on the License Approval feature\n1. Create an MR that doesn't change anything related to licenses (like update Readme)\n1. Wait until the pipeline is finished.\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nLicense approval is required because of denied licenses added\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nLicense approval is fall back to optional\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n1.
