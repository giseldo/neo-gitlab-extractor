This makes sure that the members of the group enable 2FA or else they are not able to access group or make any changes in the group \u0026 it's projects. But a member of the group can bypass this restriction by creating an OAuth token which still has access to the group's resources.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. As User A create a private group.  \n2. Invite User B as a developer in this private group.  \n3. Go to Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Permissions and group features -\u003e Enable Require all users in this group to set up two-factor authentication  \n4. Change time before enforced as 0 hours.  \n5. Now login as User B \u0026 you will see that you are enforced to enable the 2FA or leave the group. Without leaving the group you are not allowed to access anything on gitlab UI.  \n6. Now open a terminal \u0026 run the following command with credentials of user B.  \n```  \necho 'grant_type=password\u0026username=\u003cuserB_username\u003e\u0026password=\u003cuserB_password\u003e' \u003e auth.txt  \ncurl --data \"[@]auth.txt\" --request POST \"https://gitlab.com/oauth/token\"  \n```  \nThe response would contain the access token.  \n7. Now use the access token we got from step 6 in the following command \u0026 replace the group id with the group created in step 1.  \n```  \ncurl --header \"Authorization: Bearer [OAUTH_TOKEN]\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/[GROUP_ID]\"  \n```  \nYou will see that you are able to access the group details without enabling 2FA.\n\n####  Impact\n\nAn attacker would be able to bypass the 2FA enforcement of a group \u0026 access confidential information \u0026 alter objects/resources using different OAuth scopes [available](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#authorized-applications) for the token like writing to repository.\n\n## Proposal\n\nSolution is proposed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355028#note_995592633).","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-09T16:00:59.979Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T04:26:17.790Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T07:51:20.914Z","closed_by":{"id":9043659,"username":"rshambhuni","name":"Rohit Shambhuni","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9043659/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rshambhuni"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","Deliverable","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-284","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::manage","group::authentication and authorization","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::awaiting security release"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-05-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355028","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355028","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355028/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355028/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#355028","relative":"#355028","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#355028"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104484850,"iid":355022,"project_id":278964,"title":"Allow determining if a container repository has been migrated to the new platform","description":"## Context\n\nWe are rolling out a new version of the Container Registry in GitLab.com that includes a metadata database (\u0026amp;5523). Among others, this database will allow for efficient storage usage calculations.\n\nThis issue is part of a work plan to expose the deduplicated size of grouped image repositories in the GitLab UI and API (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7228).\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen calculating the aggregated container registry usage at the project level and above, we need a way to determine if all container repositories within that project/group have been migrated to the new platform (backed by the metadata database).\n\nThis is important because, for example, if we ask the registry for the usage/size of `gitlab-org/gitlab` (a project), not all container repositories in this project may be on the new platform already. As such, the resulting figure may not be accurate.\n\n## Solution\n\nOn the Rails side, to determine if a given `ContainerRepository` has been migrated, we have to evaluate two conditions, and at least one of them must be `true`:\n\n1. `created_at \u003e= Date.new(2022, 01, 23)`: The Phase 1 migration rollout ended on 2022-01-22. Therefore, any container repository created after this date is guaranteed to be on the new platform;\n \n1. `migration_state == 'import_done'`: If a repository was not created after 2022-01-22, then it's likely an old repository. \"Likely\" because we did a percentage-based rollout for phase 1 between 2021-11-04 and 2022-01-22, so a portion of these were created on the new platform, but we don't know that on the Rails side. Therefore, if the first condition is not `true`, we need to check if the migration state is `import_done`, which tells us that this repository was on the old platform but was already migrated to the new one during phase 2.\n\n### `ContainerRepository` model\n\nWe should create a new method, e.g. `migrated?`, to perform the two evaluations listed above.\n\n### `Project` model\n\nWe'll also need to make it possible to determine if all container repositories within a project are on the new platform.\n\nThis will allow us to skip the calculation of the project usage until all repositories are on the new platform OR display an info message on the UI to make it clear that the displayed project usage is not accurate because not all repositories are on the new platform.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-09T15:19:41.757Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T15:30:36.291Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T15:08:42.216Z","closed_by":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Container Registry Migration::Phase 2","Package:P1","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::package","feature::enhancement","group::package registry","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355022","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355022","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355022/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/355022/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#355022","relative":"#355022","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#355022"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7228,"epic":{"id":401185,"iid":7228,"title":"Project-level storage usage visibility for the Container Registry","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7228","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104622599,"iid":355618,"project_id":278964,"title":"Restarting auto-stopped Environments does not work (intermittent)","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen starting a deployment (start_review_app) after the environment is auto-stopped, the environment doesn't restart.\n\nThis means the deployment doesn't show up in the environments tab - and the deployment isn't auto-stopped after the expected time.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. create a new project \n1.

definitions attempts to compute it with appointed metric instrumentation class. In [`ee/lib/ee/gitlab/usage_data.rb#L88`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/usage_data.rb#L88) file, license related metric were only included if there is active license present for given instance. That caused those metrics being missing for EE instances without active license, and made ServicePing attempt to use instrumentation classes. However  \nmetrics instrumentation classes in `EE` directory does not account for EE instances without active license, and raises missing methods errors for nil class.\n\n**Because some of `License.current` calls are made outside of hardening methods (eg: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/gitlab/usage/metrics/instrumentations/license_metric.rb#L35), all ServicePing process fails if instance is affectec**\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

It'll be placed in the top-right corner of the DSP card, with 8px padding on top and right between the button and the edges of the card.\n- When the DSP has no failed or canceled jobs, the button won't show up (just like the retry button on the DSP pipeline page)\n- Permissions should be the same as a permissions to retry the DSP from the pipeline page. If user has no permissions to retry, button won't show up.\n- When user clicks to retry the DSP, the pipeline will update its status just like it does when you retry it from the pipeline page.\n\n#### Further details\n\n* When a DSP is successful, the retry button won't show\n* When you click retry, the button becomes a \"cancel\" button which will cancel the pipeline retry if you press it\n* The Cancel button will persist as long as the pipeline is running\n* If the pipeline is successful, the button disappears from the DSP card, and if it fails then the \"Cancel\" button becomes \"Retry\" again\n\n\u003c!-- What is the user problem you are trying to solve with this issue? --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n:warning:  **We will not be enabling this feature flag on production**, because we [want to remove non-trace artifacts on SaaS as well](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78806#note_818425247). The reason for that is detailed in the linked MR comment.\n\nAs a result, there are 2 permutations of the feature flags:\n| Environment | `ci_detect_wrongly_expired_artifacts` | `ci_destroy_all_expired_service` | Feature flag source of truth |\n| ------ | ------ | --- | --- |\n| SaaS | false | true - after [background migration is completed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/79547) | chatops |\n| Self-managed | true | true | yaml |\n\nIn order to release this change safely, without inadvertently enabling the flags on SaaS, we need to ensure that the 2 feature flags have been explicitly disabled on production through chatops.\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- **Disable** the feature globally on production environment.\n  - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_detect_wrongly_expired_artifacts false`\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82681\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [x] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [x] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [x] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [x] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag.

#1498354](https://hackerone.com/reports/1498354)** by `st4nly0n` on 2022-03-03, assigned to @ankelly:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\nSummary  \n=====================\n\nFiles in the main branch of a repository can only be modified by members with high privileges within the repository and cannot be directly modified by any other user.\n\nIn this context, the use case where the user is asked to execute a script by making a **curl** request to a file located in the main branch of a repository could have unintended consequences, for example:  \n```bash  \ncurl https://gitlab.com/user/repo/-/raw/main/install.sh | bash  \n```  \nThe fact that the file being downloaded is in the main branch of the repository generates certain confidence and security in the user, since the files in the main branch are stable.\n\nWhen you download a repository with the download button, you get the latest commit or file changes, however, when you push a tag with the name of the main branch for example (main) pointing to a particular commit, It will cause that when downloading the repository, `refs/tags/main` will be obtained and not `refs/heads/main`, this has the consequence that a developer can modify the content of a file in the main branch in `https://gitlab.com/user/repo/-/raw/main/install.sh` with arbitrary code that would be executed by the victim using the use case mentioned   \nabove, i.e. getting and executing code from a file using **curl**.  \n \n\nSteps to reproduce:  \n=====================\n\n**[PREPARATION]**  \n**1.** Create a repository from gitlab.com, with main branch name main.\n\n**2.** Add a member with developer permissions.\n\n**3.** Clone the repository and create a `hello_world.sh` file with the following content:  \n```bash  \necho 'Hello World'  \n```\n\n**4.** Push the changes to the remote.  \n \n\n**[ATTACK]** *(Guest user in step 2)*  \n**5.** Clone and enter the repository created in step 1  \n```bash  \ngit clone https:...  \n```\n\n**6.** Create a new branch with the name `new-feature`  \n```bash  \ngit checkout -b 'new-feature'  \n```\n\n**7.** Edit the content of `hello_world.sh`:  \n```bash  \necho 'cat /etc/passwd' \u003e hello_world.sh  \n```\n\n**8.** Push the `new-feature` branch:  \n```bash  \ngit add .  \ngit commit -m 'new-feature'  \ngit push origin HEAD  \n```\n\n**9.** Create a bash variable with the hash of the last commit in the `new-feature` branch  \n```bash  \nhash=`git rev-parse HEAD`  \n```\n\n**10.** Switch to the `main` branch  \n```bash  \ngit checkout main  \n```\n\n**11.** Create a tag with the name of main pointing to the latest commit of the `new-feature` branch  \n```bash  \ngit tag main $hash  \n```\n\n**12.** Push the tags to the remote:  \n```bash  \ngit push origin --tags  \n```\n\n**13.** Remove the `new-feature` branch from the remote:  \n```bash  \ngit push -d origin 'new-feature'  \n```\n\nAs a result of this behavior an attacker can manage to change the code of the files in the main branch, causing arbitrary commands to be executed if the victim uses the use case of executing code by making a request to the file url via **curl**.  \n \n\nWhat is the current *bug* behavior?  \n===========================\n\nWhen a tag is pushed with the name of the main branch for example (main) that points to a particular commit, it will cause `refs/tags/main` and not `refs/heads/main` to be obtained when downloading the repository.  \n \n\nWhat is the expected *correct* behavior?  \n===========================\n\nThe file at `https://gitlab.com/user/repo/-/raw/main/file.sh` should not be modified by pushing a tag with the main branch name.  \n \n\nRelevant logs and/or screenshots  \n===========================\n\nIn the proof of concept video it is shown how the victim uses the use case where he executes the code of a file in the main branch through **curl** obtaining the expected result, however, an attacker was able to change the content of the file from the main branch, now the victim when executing the same command gets an unexpected result.  \n![poc.mp4](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/cf075506-82d9-4e4d-8083-4c79c11fdb8f/poc.mp4)  \n \n\nOutput of checks  \n===========================\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com  \n \n\n####  Impact\n\nAn attacker is able to change the content of a main branch file by pushing a tag with the main branch name, this results in the execution of arbitrary commands by the victim using **curl** to execute code from a main branch. file in the main branch.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n*

This means validation is enforced and cannot be turned off.\n\n### Breaking Change\n\nThe removal of this configuration variable itself is not a breaking change. However, any reports that are currently failing validation will be rejected starting in GitLab %15.0. See [decisions](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6968#decisions) in the parent epic for more information.\n\nOnce #335789+ is delivered, potentially in %14.9 but definitely by %14.10, a new feature flag will be introduced: [`enforce_security_report_validation`]([https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351000]). Timeline:\n- %14.9 or %14.10: FF introduced; defaults to false.\n- %15.0 FF defaults to true.\n- %15.3 FF is removed; feature will be on and can no longer be turned off.\n\nWhile `enforce_security_report_validation` and `VALIDATE_SCHEMA` co-exist, this is the defined behavior:\n- `enforce_security_report_validation` is on: `VALIDATE_SCHEMA` is ignored.\n- `enforce_security_report_validation` is off: `VALIDATE_SCHEMA` is honored.\n\n### Affected Topology\n\nBoth SaaS and self-managed.\n\n\n### Affected Tier\n\n* Ultimate\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] `@mention` your stage's stable counterparts on this issue. For example, Customer Support, Customer Success (Technical Account Manager), Product Marketing Manager.\n  - To see who the stable counterparts are for a product team visit [product categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/)\n       - @gerardo If there is no stable counterpart listed for Sales/CS please mention `@timtams`\n       - @greg If there is no stable counterpart listed for Support please mention `@gitlab-com/support/managers`\n       - @cblake If there is no stable counterpart listed for Marketing please mention `@cfoster3`\n\n- [ ] `@mention` your GPM so that they are aware of planned deprecations. The goal is to have reviews happen at least two releases before the final removal of the feature or introduction of a breaking change.\n\n### Deprecation Milestone\n\n%\"14.9\" \n\u003c!-- In which milestone will this deprecation be announced ? --\u003e\n\n### Planned Removal Milestone\n\n%15.0 (variable is ignored)\n\n%15.3 (code is removed)\n\n\u003c!-- In which milestone will the feature or functionality be removed and announced? --\u003e\n\n### Links\n\n\u003c!--\nAdd links to any relevant documentation or code that will provide additional details or clarity regarding the planned change.\n\nThis issue is the main SSOT for the deprecations and removals process.

Has anyone have idea what's going on?\n\u003e\n\u003e https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/9ea1f390-9ed1-11ec-bd7b-c108343628c3\n\u003e\n\u003e ![image](/uploads/e3624186725eabdbf1a44b507bbe83f7/image.png)\n\nNot sure yet if the memory usage is related or just a red herring, I can also see GRPC::DeadlineExceeded errors with lower memory usage: https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/33540540-9f05-11ec-bd7b-c108343628c3. Generally this error happens with very large commits, or very overloaded file servers.\n\n[Searching in Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+%22JiraConnect%3A%3ASyncBranchWorker%22) I found two related issues:\n\n- https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/3116702/\n  - This one is triggered from the `commits.stats` call at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/9f7e9a6af3259c8e145f42a0c8feddeb0032d15e/lib/atlassian/jira_connect/serializers/commit_entity.rb#L25\n  - This looks like a N+1 issue since we're fetching stats for each individual commit, but it doesn't look like we have a bulk version of the `CommitStats` RPC yet in Gitaly.\n- https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/issues/3213106/\n  - This one is triggered from the `find_branch` call at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/9f7e9a6af3259c8e145f42a0c8feddeb0032d15e/app/workers/jira_connect/sync_branch_worker.rb#L21\n\n## Questions\n\n- Why does this error seem to correlate with high memory usage?\n- Why are we not seeing more events in Sentry?\n- Is the N+1 issue something we should fix?\n\n## Proposal\n\nCheck if we can skip the syntax highlighting at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4677ac06d61e19f0f64a6b0559df72f809996b7f/lib/gitlab/diff/file_collection/merge_request_diff_base.rb#L26.\n\nAlso check how Jira actually uses the files at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/3fbe1e3bf404740882509b5e3abd88dd661983b8/lib/atlassian/jira_connect/serializers/commit_entity.rb#L28, maybe we don't really need to send these at

Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the feature](ISSUE LINK) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `iteration_cadences` feature flag.\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::project management\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: [`#s_plan`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C72HPNV97)\n- Best individual to reach out to: @euko (APAC), @acroitor (EMEA), @mcelicalderonG (AMER)\n- PM: @gweaver\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n- @gweaver (PM)\n- @donaldcook (EM)\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nIteration feature will be superseded by Iteration Cadences feature as described in the documentation https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/#iterations.\n\n### When is the feature viable?\n\nAnother FF `vue_issue_lists` (it's been default-enabled already) must be enabled to use this FF. \n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf we have to revert and disable the feature flag, the iterations under automated cadences - which can only be created after the enablement of the FF - are going to become unusable as they cannot be individually edited until the FF is enabled again. Moreover, current we don't have a way to filter out these unusable iterations in the UI or via the API.\n\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? --\u003e\n_Consider mentioning checks for 5xx errors or other anomalies like an increase in redirects \n(302 HTTP response status)_\n\n### What can we check for monitoring production after rollouts?\n\n_Consider adding links to check for Sentry errors, Production logs for 5xx, 302s, etc._\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-08T13:39:01.263Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T12:00:48.632Z","closed_at":"2022-10-05T16:37:09.043Z","closed_by":{"id":4303289,"username":"gweaver","name":"Gabe

MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/282#note_866405912) for a starting point.\n\n### Proposal\n\nHere are a few different approaches we can use:\n\n1. Update the `script` section of the [qa-dependency_scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/2195a5db0a5ab270bc3adbce75602aeea5cb4e70/includes-dev/qa-dependency_scanning.yml#L15-40) job to look for the presence of a new variable which is passed from `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` and contains a list of expected `CycloneDX` artifact paths. The `qa-dependency_scanning` job will then check to make sure these artifact files exist. See [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/282#note_866448271) for more details.\n1. Wait until [Draft: Test Graph testing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/merge_requests/19) has been merged, then add a check to [integration-test/scripts/dependency-scanning-qa.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/blob/7c9d53a28e0a6c2a1615a20754480ba5f65936e6/scripts/dependency-scanning-qa.rb) to check for the presence of these CycloneDX files, using a similar technique to [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/integration-test/-/blob/80fc548cf26df6bb3bbaa4ab89257d43427cb62e/scripts/graph-qa.rb#L10-11).\n\nWe need to decide which of the above is the best approach and then create an implementation plan\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nWe've decided to implement option `1.` from the Proposal listed above:\n\n1. [x] Update the `script` section of the [qa-dependency_scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/blob/2195a5db0a5ab270bc3adbce75602aeea5cb4e70/includes-dev/qa-dependency_scanning.yml#L15-40) job to look for the presence of a new variable which is passed from `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-python` and contains a list of expected `CycloneDX` artifact paths. The `qa-dependency_scanning` job will then check to make sure these artifact files exist. \n\n   This new variable should be named `EXPECTED_CYCLONEDX_ARTIFACTS` and contains a comma-separated list of artifact paths to check.\n\n   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/ci-templates/-/merge_requests/282+\n\n2. [x] Add job integration tests which pass `EXPECTED_CYCLONEDX_ARTIFACTS` in the following projects:\n\n   - gemnasium\n   \n      https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/280+\n\n   - gemnasium-maven\n   \n      https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/merge_requests/174+\n\n   - gemnasium-python\n   \n      https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/merge_requests/153+\n\n\n/cc @fcatteau @gonzoyumo @NicoleSchwartz","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-08T10:42:50.162Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T03:21:34.180Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T00:18:57.696Z","closed_by":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"labels":["Category:Dependency Scanning","Deliverable","Enterprise Edition","GitLab Ultimate","Software Bill of Materials (SBoM)","[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","backend","devops::secure","feature::enhancement","group::composition analysis","section::sec","test","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1674572,"username":"adamcohen","name":"Adam Cohen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/68fe8da9d9dfc88d0d150808cd364825?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/adamcohen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354863","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":2},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354863","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354863/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354863/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#354863","relative":"#354863","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#354863"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6917,"epic":{"id":370405,"iid":6917,"title":"Internal SBOM Update + CycloneDX","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6917","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104371000,"iid":354856,"project_id":278964,"title":"Investigate performance of import project members","description":"### Investigate performance of import project members\n\n`lib/api/projects.rb:612:54: post \":id/import_project_members/:project_id\", feature_category: :experimentation_expansion`\n\n[Add import project members API endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/d02bb2f298af86e22329eb56775ef54640bb6e83)\n\n### Plan\n\n- [x] Look into resolving possible query performance or other latency issues described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354856#note_867588755\n   - [import method saving each member could be culprit on large projects](http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/aca511ba9f696cd7f438b0f724573e6b16a1c96a/app/models/project_team.rb#L140-140).

Version App collects and persists all Service Ping reports. To verify Service Ping processing in your local development environment, follow this guide.

folder of `gitlab` project:\n\n```shell\n$ QA_DEBUG=1 QA_LARGE_IMPORT_GH_TOKEN=test_client_token GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=token_passed_to_gitlab bundle exec rspec qa/specs/features/api/1_manage/import_large_github_repo_spec.rb\nRandomized with seed 1227\n\nManage\n  Project import\n...\n```\n\nwhere both tokens just have to be valid github api tokens.

We can whitelist domains and members will be restricted if the users Email domain is not under the whitelist configuration. \n\n[Restrict Group access by domain wiki](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#restrict-group-access-by-domain)\n\nThe wiki states that the once domain whitelist is added new members with other domains are restricted from adding into the Groups and it's projects. This check is not implemented properly in \"Invite a Group\" option. So using the \"Invite a Group\" option we can by-pass the whitelist domain config and add unauthorised user to the Groups and it's projects.  \n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a group in Gitlab. Once group is created  add a domain whitelist configuration under   \n        -\u003e Go to the group’s Settings \u003e General page.  \n        -\u003e Expand the Permissions and group features section.  \n        -\u003e In the Restrict membership by email field, enter the domain names. For testing I have added test domains \"slack.com\" and \"test.com\"  \n        -\u003eSelect Save changes.\n\n2. Let us consider this group as \"Victim\" group.After domain restriction is added we can only invite new members to the group whose Email domains   \n      matches \"slack.com\" and \"test.com\". Members  with other domains cannot be added to this group.   \n3. Create a new sample Project  in Victim group and add some members (who have the whitelist Email domains) into the Project with \"Maintainer\" Role.   \n      Now login into the newly added member account. This member account have \"Maintainer\" role access for the project and can add new members to the   \n      project.  Let us consider this account as \"Account2\".  \n4. Now from \"Account2\" try to invite a new member to the project whose Email doesn't match the whitelist configuration. It will be restricted.\n\n5. To by-pass this, from \"Account2\" create a new group and add some members to the group. Let us consider this group as \"Attacker\". This attacker group contains members whose email domains are not in \"Victim\" groups whitelist configuration.  \n     Victim Group has whitelist domains -\u003e \"slack.com\" and \"test.com\"  \n     Attacker Group have members with Email -\u003e \"wearehackerone.com\"  \n\n6. Now from \"Account2\" go the project in  Victim group   and use the \"Invite a Group\" option under \"Project Information\" -\u003e \"Members\" -\u003e \"Invite a Group\". Invite the \"Attacker\" group. Now Attacker group have access to the Project under Victim group. Note that \"Victim\" group have whitelist domains \"slack.com\" and \"test.com\" and the attacker group have members whose Emails are in domains \"wearehackerone.com\". So the invite a Group option doesn't restrict members from the invited groups for whitelist configuration. \n\nHave added a screen recording demonstrating the issue. \n\n#####  Impact  \nWhitelist domain configuration is not restricted when using \"Invite a Group\" option which leads to Project maintainers adding unauthorised members to the Groups Project's. \n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?  \nProject maintainers in a Group with whitelist Domain Configuration can add new members using \"invite a group\" option to the Groups Projects whose Email domains doesn't match the whitelist domain configuration. \n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?  \nProject maintainers in a Group with whitelist Domain Configuration should be restricted from adding new members \"invite a group\" option  to the Groups Projects whose Email domains doesn't match the whitelist domain configuration. \n\n#####  Output of checks\n\n This bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n######  Results of GitLab environment info\n\n####  Impact\n\nWhitelist domain configuration is not restricted when using \"Invite a Group\" option which leads to Project maintainers adding unauthorised members to the Groups Project's.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [Screen_Recording_2022-03-05_at_8.30.22_PM.mov](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4ffac923-65cc-4f54-8b26-81a5822e3213/Screen_Recording_2022-03-05_at_8.30.22_PM.mov)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-07T19:08:54.074Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T19:43:39.296Z","closed_at":"2022-06-30T19:49:12.509Z","closed_by":{"id":5791466,"username":"ngeorge1","name":"Nikhil George","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5791466/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ngeorge1"},"labels":["Deliverable","Group Sharing","HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-284","backend","bug::vulnerability","devops::manage","group::organization","priority::3","section::dev","security","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::awaiting security release"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":10327656,"username":"abdwdd","name":"Abdul Wadood","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10327656/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abdwdd"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":10327656,"username":"abdwdd","name":"Abdul Wadood","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10327656/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abdwdd"},"user_notes_count":40,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-05-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354791","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354791","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354791/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354791/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#354791","relative":"#354791","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#354791"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104311362,"iid":354769,"project_id":278964,"title":"MVC Design- Epic links","description":"MVC synthesis from https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7531\n\n## Epic linking MVC\nFor MVC, users should be able to:\n* Understand the use case of epic linking and the purpose of the widget.\n* Understand if they have permission to link epics.\n* Link epics across groups to the current epic.\n* Understand the group assignment of epics.\n\n| MVC flow | \n| ------ |\n| \u003cimg src=\"/uploads/841020cdea9d8b32cb970e05cd6794c2/flowideation.png\" width=\"500\"\u003e | \n\n###### 🎨 \u003cstrike\u003eImprove the empty state of the linked issues and epic widgets.\u003c/strike\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359145\n- [-Remove-] the `info` icon and link, and add copy to the body of the widget with context on use case.

Where do users go to from Pipeline index page?\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nSet up data tracking for the actions users perform on the pipeline index page so we're able to triangulate the information from the qualitative research with the data and make better decisions to declutter the page.\n\n\n\u003c!--\n* Use this issue template for creating requests to track snowplow events\n* Snowplow events can be both Frontend (javascript) or Backend (Ruby)\n* Snowplow is currently not used for self-hosted instances of GitLab - Self-hosted still rely on usage ping for product analytics - Snowplow is used for GitLab SaaS\n* You do not need to create an issue to track generic front-end events, such as All page views, sessions, link clicks, some button clicks, etc.\n* What you should capture are specific events with defined business logic. For example, when a user creates an incident by escalating an existing alert, or when a user creates and pushes up a new Node package to the NPM registry.\n* For more details read https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/programs/data-for-product-managers/\n --\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nWe generally recommend events be tracked using a [structured event](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/#structured-events) which has 5 properties you can use. There may be instances where structured events are not sufficient. You may want to track an event where the property changes frequently or is general something very unique. In those cases, use a [self-describing event](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/#self-describing-events)\n\n--\u003e\n\n## Structured Snowplow events to track\n\n* Category: The page or backend area of the application. Unless infeasible, please use the Rails page attribute by default in the frontend, and namespace + classname on the backend. If you're not sure what it is, work with your engineering manager to figure it out.\n* Action: A string that is used to define the user action. The first word should always describe the action or aspect: clicks should be `click`, activations should be `activate`, creations should be `create`, etc. Use underscores to describe what was acted on; for example, activating a form field would be `activate_form_input`. An interface action like clicking on a dropdown would be `click_dropdown`, while a behavior like creating a project record from the backend would be `create_project`\n* Label: Optional. The specific element, or object that's being acted on. This is either the label of the element (e.g. a tab labeled 'Create from template' may be `create_from_template`) or a unique identifier if no text is available (e.g. closing the Groups dropdown in the top navbar might be `groups_dropdown_close`), or it could be the name or title attribute of a record being created.\n* Property: Optional. Any additional property of the element, or object being acted on.\n* Value: Optional, numeric. Describes a numeric value (decimal) directly related to the event. This could be the value of an input (e.g. `10` when clicking `internal` visibility)\n\n| Label | Action | Image |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_manual_actions` | ![Frame_3](/uploads/042afa61dc9d2d99a7999b78eb7bfcaf/Frame_3.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_retry_button` | ![Frame_12](/uploads/5104a65bc08b8f4e7f078021fb97a7e1/Frame_12.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_artifacts_dropdown` | ![Frame_4](/uploads/139c7dfd17acce865e9afddb03edfe5d/Frame_4.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_cancel_button` | ![Frame_2](/uploads/f3612150b7de780c6d3561131611cbb3/Frame_2.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_ci_status_badge` |  ![Frame_7](/uploads/7b74ad4497565088d1bfd30df0a1778e/Frame_7.png)|\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_pipeline_id` |  ![Frame_8](/uploads/46bd1f535ba8bcdb869546eee721f529/Frame_8.png)|\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_commit_sha` | ![Frame_10](/uploads/4cea67fb53163525f498bb4a30a6e0db/Frame_10.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_mr_ref` | ![Frame_9](/uploads/d417e8624acc1dc8d5f4b7c534258009/Frame_9.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_minigraph` | ![Frame_5](/uploads/3f09d0231a0a60328a25b8a2876792ea/Frame_5.png) |\n| `pipelines_table_component` | `click_commit_title` | ![Frame_6](/uploads/433f810372ec12e7aaf67e1ba951a09b/Frame_6.png) |\n| `pipelines_filtered_search` | `click_filtered_search` | ![Frame_11](/uploads/05c5e0b367f1d50a8554a75a5f4edd35/Frame_11.png) |\n| `pipelines_filter_tabs` | `click_filter_tabs` | ![Frame_1](/uploads/85a5f03cc745e52fd8dee01dbd633ab7/Frame_1.png) |\n\n\u003c!--\n  Snowplow event tracking starts with instrumentation and completed after a chart is created in Sisense.\n\n  Use this checklist to ensure all steps are completed\n--\u003e\n\n## Snowplow event tracking checklist\n* [ ] Engineering complete work and deploy changes to GitLab SaaS\n* [ ] Verify the new Snowplow events are listed in the [Snowplow Event Exploration](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/539181/Snowplow-Event-Exploration---last-30-days) dashboard\n* [ ] Create chart(s) to track your event(s) in the relevant dashboard\n  * [ ] Use the [Chart Snowplow Actions](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/snippet/Chart-Snowplow-Actions/5546da87ae2c4a3fbc98415c88b3eedd/edit) SQL snippet to quickly visualize usage.

direct to some gitaly timeouts.\nOur tests were mainly performed around `Mar 3, 2022 3:44pm GMT+0100` and `Mar 3, 2022 4:21pm GMT+0100` and again (with the pipeline configuration above) around `Mar 4, 2022 12:21pm GMT+0100`.\n\nAs we are planning to use a single GitLab agent per shared cluster/environment with multiple developer teams, this limit/error is currently a blocker of our proof-of-value.\n\nI'm happy to provide any additional details or to re-run our deployment/example pipelines.\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nProposed Labels: ~\"devops::configure\"

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] Notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be executed in the `#production` slack channel and cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can [create a separate issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\nYou can either [create a follow-up issue for Feature Flag Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Flag%20Cleanup) or use the checklist below in this same issue.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This

After the Group Access Token feature was launched the same user type was shared for Group tokens which will not be associated to any projects, thereby the nil and the error when the code queries **user.projects.first**.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\u003c!-- Describe how one can reproduce the issue - this is very important. Please use an ordered list. --\u003e\n\n1. Use GitLab 14.8.0 or higher (GitLab.com is affected too)\n1. Visit any Group and create a Group Access Token\n1. Visit Admin \u003e Credentials and it will outright fail\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report. If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\n- Accessing the path `/admin/credentials` results in **500** error\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\n- Accessing the path `/admin/credentials` should not result in **500** error\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to

ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/220910).\n\nI have a project for reproducing some of their issues, and it frequently fails to import with:\n\n```\nERROR -- : Exception: 4:Deadline Exceeded.\n```\n\nThe customer is also seeing this, having worked through some other issues.\n\nIt appears to be caused by repository housekeeping.  This doesn't (on the face of it) seem to be critical to the success of an import.  \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPerform an import on a project with large repository.  Housekeeping runs after most/all of the other import tasks are complete.\n\n### Example Project\n\nI have a 664MB project export, but it's too big to attach here.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nImport fails with `Exception: 4:Deadline Exceeded.`\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nImport succeeds.\n\nIF a repo needs housekeeping, Gitaly can handle that on its own schedule?\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nLog output from\n\n- Importing my test project to a test Omnibus instance.\n- GitLab

container registry project level usage on project_statistics table","description":"## Context\n\nWe are rolling out a new version of the Container Registry in GitLab.com that includes a metadata database (\u0026amp;5523). Among others, this database will allow for efficient storage usage calculations.\n\nThis issue is part of a work plan to expose the deduplicated project-level usage in GitLab Rails.\n\n## Problem\n\nTo unblock https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/12036, we need to persist the container registry project-level usage to the `project_statistics` table in the Rails database. A change in `project_statistics` will also be used later to trigger the namespace usage refresh.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Background\n\nAt the moment, Rails queries the Container Registry API to obtain the size of a given image repository whenever a user queries its API or refreshes the UI.\n\nThis real-time/on-demand approach won't work for this particular case. Project statistics must be kept up to date. A user may push many images to the registry but never, or only infrequently, go to a UI page or make an API call that would trigger fetching the current usage from the registry. So updating the project statistics value after retrieving it from the registry (in response to a user-triggered event) is not enough. Additionally, we should avoid doing database writes during a read API request (so that reads can adhere to read-only replicas).\n\nAlternatively, we could have a cron job that would periodically retrieve the container registry usage for each project in a predefined cadence and update the project statistics. However, this is highly inefficient. At least on GitLab.com, most image repositories change infrequently, as the Container Registry API rate is +90% reads. So there is no point in doing this.\n\n### Solution\n\nFor GitLab.com, the Container Registry is already delivering async notifications to Rails whenever something is uploaded or deleted. These notifications are currently used for Snowplow metrics and Geo-replication. They are delivered to the `/api/v4/container_registry_event/events` API endpoint, and processed by `API::ContainerRegistryEvent` and `ContainerRegistry::Event` classes.\n\nThe notification payload includes the timestamp, the action, and the target image repository. This is documented [**here**](https://docs.docker.com/registry/notifications/#events), including examples.\n\nWe can start processing these same notifications for storage usage purposes.\n\n#### Tasks\n\n1. [x] Add new `container_registry_size` column to `project_statistics`;\n\n2. [x] Add new `registry_size` method on the `Project` model. This method should trigger a `GET /gitlab/v1/repositories/my-group/my-project/?size=self_with_descendants` call to the Container Registry API, which will be possible based on the work from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347351 (which this issue is blocked by);\n\n3. [x] Add new `update_registry_size` method to `ProjectStatistics`. This method should call `Project#registry_size` and persist the returned size in `project_statistics.container_registry_size`.\n\n4. [x] Modify `ContainerRegistry::Event` so that for each inbound notification where `target.repository` is e.g. `my-group/my-project/my-app` it will: \n\n   1. Parse the `action` within the notification payload. Only `push` or `delete` actions can increase or decrease the registry usage. We should therefore discard notifications with other actions;\n\n   1. Discard notifications that do not have a `target.tag` property. We only need to process tag creation and deletion events, as those are the only ones that can lead to an increase or decrease in usage;\n\n   1. Identify the corresponding `ContainerRepository` object and the enclosing `Project` object, based on the `target.repository` property of the notification payload;\n\n   1. Spawn a `UpdateProjectStatisticsWorker` background job to update the project statistics. We should pass an array of statistics that only target the registry usage. In turn, the worker should execute `ProjectStatistics#update_registry_size`.\n\n#### Notes\n\nOne may ask why the size is not part of the notification sent from the registry? Calculating the *deduplicated* size of image repositories can only be done at runtime, and that calculation comes with a computational cost. It's not free (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/493 for an explanation).\n\nFor example, when cleanup policies run, a large number of tags can be deleted in a repository. Each of these tag deletions will trigger a notification. It would be counterproductive to calculate and include the size in all these notifications.\n\nWith this approach, we can stage (and deduplicate) bursts of notifications for the same target *project* on the Rails side and reduce the calls to the registry API. We intend to add caching to the container registry later on, which will allow us to simplify this process down the road. But for now, this is the most efficient option.\n\n#### Open Questions\n\nTechnically, how we can stage and deduplicate bursts of notifications for the same target *project* is still an open question.\n\nFor example, suppose a user pushes 5 new tags to 5 different repositories that belong to the same project at about the same time. In that case, Rails will receive 25 async notifications close to each other. Triggering the refresh of project statistics for every single of these notifications is inefficient. Ideally, we'd stage notifications for the same project during, e.g., 5 minutes, and once those 5 minutes pass, we'd only trigger the related project statistics refresh once.\n\n#### Caveats\n\nAs a caveat, we know that the async registry notifications are only configured in GitLab.com at the moment. It's already possible to enable them on self-managed, but they are off by default. This will have to change in the future once we're ready to release the new registry for self-managed installs.\n\nAdditionally, these notifications don't provide delivery guarantees. We don't know if this is a problem and how often it occurs (if ever). We have an issue to improve this down the road (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/335). We should accept this caveat, as this is the best we can do. We'll find a solution if/when this becomes a real problem and not just a possibility.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-04T11:29:17.241Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T17:54:29.872Z","closed_at":"2022-05-26T07:56:51.072Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["Category:Container Registry","Fulfillment::Storage","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","auto updated","backend","devops::package","group::utilization","missed:14.10","missed:15.0","ruby","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":5054840,"username":"jdrpereira","name":"João Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5054840/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jdrpereira"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":59,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354480","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":4},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"4 of 4 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354480","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354480/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/354480/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#354480","relative":"#354480","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#354480"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7228,"epic":{"id":401185,"iid":7228,"title":"Project-level storage usage visibility for the Container Registry","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7228","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104089792,"iid":354456,"project_id":278964,"title":"Advanced Search password causing 500s","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nThe field for the password for the ElasticSearch instance causes 500 when a special character is present in the password.\n\nSince the requirement for a password is:\n\n\u003e Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.\n\nChanging the password to have `-` as the special character is a workaround.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Go to Menu \u003e Admin \u003e Settings \u003e Advanced Search\n- On the password field enter a password that has a special character like `@` or `$`\n- See 500 error\n\n### Example Project\n\n\u003c!-- If possible, please create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic \nbehavior, and link to it here in the bug report.
