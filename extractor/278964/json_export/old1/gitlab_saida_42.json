visibility for shared runner usage for user namespaces","description":"\u003c!-- The first section \"Release notes\" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: \"Problem to solve\", \"Intended users\", \"User experience goal\", and \"Proposal\", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Release Notes\n\nTracking how many of your [CI Minutes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/cicd_minutes.html#how-cicd-minutes-are-calculated) you are using each month for public projects is hard, especially across projects. \n\nNow each namespace's CI Minute usage is displayed along side the Runner Duration in the Usage Quota. You can see how many minutes each project has used by month and how minute usage is trending overtime.\n\n### Problem to solve \n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340504/ we are adding a section under Analytics\u003e\u003eCI/CD at group level to expose shared runner usage. We should treat top-level groups and user namespaces the same with regards to this data. But user namespaces don't have Analytics section.\n\n\n### User experience goal\n\nUsers should be able to get access to the shared runner usage for the projects under the namespace.\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n`Scope of this issue:`\n\n1. Change text for existing CI Minutes usage to `CI/CD minutes` everywhere on usage quota page\n1. Add a padding under `Pipelines` tab and and change header font size\n1. Introduce `Shared runners usage` tab with popover for `Monthly usage` charts only\n\n`Not in scope of this issue`\n1. Introduce `Shared runners usage` tab with popover for `By project` charts only\n2. Add shared runner duration consumption information to the table below\n\n\n\u003e We accumulate `shared runners duration` at root-namespace level but we also have the usage per project. We should be able to display the equivalent chart as `User Settings \u003e Usage Quotas \u003e CI minutes usage by project`.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\nEnsure we have feature tests for this page.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\n- User is able to access the `shared runners duration` analytics for their personal namespace.\n- This Analytics page (like Usage Quotas page) is only available to the namespace owner.\n- This new page is documented for User Namespaces and Groups in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/cicd_minutes.html\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e\n*This page may contain information related to upcoming products, features and functionality.\nIt is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.\nJust like with all projects, the items mentioned on the page are subject to change or delay, and the development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the sole discretion of GitLab Inc.*\n\u003c!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-16T11:24:13.983Z","updated_at":"2022-05-20T14:47:37.078Z","closed_at":"2022-04-29T13:21:05.113Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["CI minutes","Category:Continuous Integration","FY23::Q2","GitLab Free","GitLab Premium","GitLab Ultimate","OKR","SUS::Impacting","Stretch","Technical Writing","UI text","UX","Verify::P2","customer","devops::verify","direction","documentation","frontend","group::pipeline execution","release post item","release post item::in review","section::ops","severity::1","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"},{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"}],"author":{"id":6115425,"username":"v_mishra","name":"Veethika M","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f09a3a0badac17a57e28b4e18a45c1c0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/v_mishra"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":829774,"username":"jivanvl","name":"Jose Ivan Vargas","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/730cc1b85a20f2a3891829f7aa198972?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jivanvl"},"user_notes_count":42,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345795","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345795","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345795/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345795/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345795","relative":"#345795","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345795"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7561,"epic":{"id":442014,"iid":7561,"title":"CI minutes and Runner Duration Visibility Charts MVC","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7561","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97402140,"iid":345774,"project_id":278964,"title":"Background migration to fix location data mismatch in vulnerability_occurrences","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nWhile working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342025 we found that there were some records in `vulnerability_occurrences` table where `location` did not match with `raw_metadata-\u003e'location'`.

When a package is uploaded, it may include several files. For package manager formats that allow duplicate uploads, it's possible that they can include many files. For example, for Maven, you likely publish a version of a package and also publish daily snapshots of that package. But those older snapshot files are not useful. So, you'd like to programmatically delete them. \n\nAs part of the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5152, the Package group aims to deliver package-cleanup policies to help you manage storage for the Package Registry. As an MVC, we'll focus on removing old, unused files. \n\nTo do so, we will:\n\n- Create a background job to scalably handle the marking and deletion of files. (That's this issue)\n- Create a GraphQL endpoint to help CRUD the policies. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346153\n- Add this functionality to your project's settings. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227233\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nWhy a background job?\n\n* Having a simple API endpoint to execute the cleanup will not scale. We will be forced to limit the number of packages and/or package files targeted/deleted. It is what we have with the [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#delete-registry-repository-tags-in-bulk) for container tags bulk delete (see the warning message in the docs).\n* Long term, a background job will be required. No reason to put off the inevitable. \n\n### Proposal\n\n~~Create a background job that will use a single parameter `keep_n` to mark package files for deletion.~~ :point_left_tone2: **Note**: This is the cleanup policy background job that will be implemented in gitlab-org/gitlab#346153 and not here.\n\n1. Add a way to mark package files as destroyed.\n2. Add background job 1 (scheduled cron job) to find marked package files and enqueue background job 2 (limited capacity worker) to do the destruction.\n3. Add background job 2 to destroy package files.\n\n#### Further details\n\n* Mark package files as `destroyed`.\n* Make sure that `destroyed` package files are never considered by UI, APIs, services. (\u003c- that's the \"they are lost forever\" step)\n* Create a cron background job that will check if there is any `destroyed` package file. If there is any enqueue a number of cleanup package files jobs. That number could be an application setting or we could start with something hardcoded like `2`.\n* Implement the cleanup package file background job.\n* :warning: (Note @10io ) We will need logged statistics so that we can build a Kibana dashboard for these. Eg. we need to know how many `destroyed` package file they are to be cleanup at any time.\n\n#### Estimation\n\n1. 2 MRs\n   1. `destroyed` mark + update in APIs/services. Weight `2`.\n   1. Both background jobs. This is known territory as it's very similar to what has been implemented for the dependency proxy. Barring any surprise, this is straightforward but it's quite a bunch of new objects/services to implement. Weight `2`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-15T22:13:53.665Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T14:31:25.313Z","closed_at":"2022-01-20T10:59:10.530Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David

Logging and the [authentication report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#configure-the-authentication-debug-output). \n\nTo assist engineers in debugging add `DAST_CRAWL_REPORT`.

With this update, you have more flexibility with these rules and can specify multiple levels for control using the API. One particular model is when there is separation of duties between deployment executors and approvers in your organization. Another model is when approval is needed separately from multiple levels such as a QA tester group and a security group.\n\n## Problem\n\nIn the initial [MVC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343864), **both** Deployment Executors and Deployment Approvers were managed in the [**same** access level](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#protecting-environments). This could be a problem that Approvers can accidentally gain an access to the critical environment, where they are supposed to approve/reject only. To resolve the problem, we should separate access levels between executors and approvers. For example:\n\n* Production Environment:\n  * Who can deploy?: @operator-group\n  * Needs approval for deployment?:\n    * At least one approval from @qa-tester-group\n    * At least one approval from @security-group\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet users to define separate lists. To illustrate:\n\n```\nproduction environment:\n  - Required one approval from @qa-group\n  - Required two approvals from @security-group\n```\n\nand the deployment job won't be triggered until all of the approval conditions are satistifed.\n\n## Technical Proposal\n\nAdd `protected_environment_approval_access_levels` table as a clone of `protected_environment_deploy_access_levels` table. The functionalities are the same, but the data can be distinguished.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- [First-class concept for Deployment Approval (API Based)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343864#note_730963447)\n- [Tech Eval Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344233#note_731043952)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-15T08:18:37.752Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T18:35:52.185Z","closed_at":"2022-04-18T05:31:37.448Z","closed_by":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"labels":["Category:Environment Management","Category:Release Orchestration","Deliverable","GitLab Premium","Next Up","Release::P1","auto updated","automation:ml","devops::release","group::release","missed-deliverable","missed:14.9","release post item::in review","section::ops","type::feature","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2204142,"iid":72,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:12:33.701Z","due_date":"2022-04-17","start_date":"2022-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/72"},"assignees":[{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"user_notes_count":40,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345678","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345678","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345678/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345678/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345678","relative":"#345678","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345678"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7819,"epic":{"id":486646,"iid":7819,"title":"(Viable maturity) Deployment Approvals","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7819","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97325916,"iid":345674,"project_id":278964,"title":"Purchase CI minutes fail for namespace without active subscription or other addon purchase","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"type::bug\" label:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=regression\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=type::bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nPurchase CI minutes fail when the namespace doesn't have a active subscription or already had addon purchase.

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/multiple_databases.html#removing-cross-database-transactions we do not allow you to write to 2 different databases within the context of a single transaction. Right now deleting a pipeline triggers `dependent: :nullify` for [`package_build_infos`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/7a93bb050fcdbffb7e3b33a8c2b93260d2fb8a98/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb#L85) and [`package_file_build_infos`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/7a93bb050fcdbffb7e3b33a8c2b93260d2fb8a98/app/models/ci/pipeline.rb#L86) which gets nested in the same transaction as the pipeline deletion. We cannot use `dependent: :nullify` across databases unfortunately. This was added to replace the foreign key constraint in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70614 in an effort to help with decomposition but `dependent: :nullify` is just as much of a problem as the FK relation (in fact it's a little worse as these block a slightly early phase ~\"sharding-blocker::phase4\" of our rollout plan).\n\n## Possible solutions\n\nSee https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/multiple_databases.html#removing-cross-database-transactions .\n\nThis will probably be best handled with \"loose foreign keys\" https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/loose_foreign_keys.html\n\n## Validating a fix\n\nThis problem causes us to add (at least) `./spec/controllers/projects/pipelines_controller_spec.rb` to the [cross modification allowlist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/7a93bb050fcdbffb7e3b33a8c2b93260d2fb8a98/spec/support/database/cross-database-modification-allowlist.yml#L34) and as such a fix should allow us to remove it from the allowlist. There may be some other cross-modification failures or false positives in the spec that we need to workaround to see and fix this failure.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-15T04:45:46.135Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T07:02:11.093Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T09:06:36.898Z","closed_by":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"labels":["Category:Package Registry","Deliverable","Package:P1","auto updated","ci-decomposition","ci-decomposition::phase4","devops::package","group::package registry","package:active","section::ops","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"}],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3983112,"username":"10io","name":"David Fernandez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c42a43361e29bf7ed36cf8e54cb54bb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/10io"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345664","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345664","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345664/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345664/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345664","relative":"#345664","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345664"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6379,"epic":{"id":309971,"iid":6379,"title":"Decomposition: Make Ops features compatible with Decomposed CI database","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6379","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97313698,"iid":345657,"project_id":278964,"title":"Stored XSS on issue comments and other pages which contain notes","description":"**[HackerOne report #1398305](https://hackerone.com/reports/1398305)** by `jarij` on 2021-11-11, assigned to @nmalcolm:\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\nThis report contains two XSS sanitization bypasses:\n\n* The [SyntaxHighlightFilter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c2e5d7b89b84cc5b44575592bb706ef75c3d1bbb/lib/banzai/filter/syntax_highlight_filter.rb) creates html from unsanitized data.

The section \"Release notes\" can be used as a summary of the feature and is also required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated using the release post item generator:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator. The remaining sections are the backbone for every feature in GitLab.\n\nThe goal of this template is brevity for quick/smaller iterations. For a more thorough list of considerations for larger features or feature sets, you can leverage the detailed [feature proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed.md). --\u003e\n\n### Release notes\n\nGitLab now includes a REST API to manage Agents and Agent Tokens. This supplements the existing GraphQL API.\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nMany community tools rely on GitLab's REST API. With only a GraphQL API to manage agents, these tools are not able to manage agents and agent tokens.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd a rest API to manage `Cluster::Agent` and `Cluster::AgentToken`\n\nThe proposed API endpoints are described in [the OpenAPI proposal MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75506) and [can be viewed here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/345603-add-rest-api-to-manage-cluster-agents/doc/api/openapi/agent.openapi.yaml)\n\n### Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Add REST API (CRUD) endpoints for `Cluster::Agent`\n- [ ] Add REST API (CRUD) endpoints for `Cluster::AgentToken`\n- [ ] Optional: Project endpoint should return list of agent ids\n- [ ] Update Agent documentation to add REST API details\n\n### Intended users\n\n\u003c!-- Who will use this feature?

Authenticate podman to registry. Use podman to push image to the remote gitlab registry.\n\nThis issue can also be reproduced with other tools and not just podman. Another examples: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2590 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340522\n\n\n\n### Example Project\n\nNA\n\n### What is the current *bug*

Possible that multiple unsaved ContainerRepository objects are getting instantiated but not persisted yet. Then at some point are attempting to persist but failing validation. I have a fix that I will MR against this issue that catches the exception and will instead do a lookup of the persisted model.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-12T15:30:18.849Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T07:44:24.744Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T22:52:17.509Z","closed_by":{"id":4059254,"username":"sabrams","name":"Steve

Example: https://explain.depesz.com/s/WJEa\n\nThis would be a good candidate for the in operator optimization: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/efficient_in_operator_queries.html\n\n**How:**\n\nIn the [data_collector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/analytics/cycle_analytics/aggregated/data_collector.rb) method we build a scope with the `BaseQueryBuilder` class. This scope is used to calculate various metrics: median, average, count, records\n\nWhen the `records` method is called we can build a slightly different version of the `BaseQueryBuilder` scope to use the IN query optimization.\n\nExample:\n\n```ruby\ndef records_fetcher\n  base_query = if group_stage? \u0026\u0026 has_any_filter_params? # author_id or milestone_id or labal_ids \n    query # use the \"original\" base query\n  else\n    BaseQueryBuilder.new(stage: stage, params: params).build_in_operator_optimized_query\n  end\n\n  RecordsFetcher.new(stage: stage, query: base_query, params: params)\nend\n```\n\nThe `build_in_operator_optimized_query` method would do something like this: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/efficient_in_operator_queries.html#basic-usage-of-querybuilder","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-12T12:34:28.553Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T07:58:36.056Z","closed_at":"2022-01-31T07:58:35.835Z","closed_by":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"labels":["Category:Value Stream Management","auto updated","backend","devops::manage","group::optimize","missed:14.7","priority::2","section::dev","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"}],"author":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4156052,"username":"ahegyi","name":"Adam Hegyi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff7cdaff6b98fba9b977f1885578b8b3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahegyi"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345589","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345589","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345589/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345589/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345589","relative":"#345589","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345589"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6046,"epic":{"id":274497,"iid":6046,"title":"[VSA] Date range filter should apply to end events","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6046","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":97234935,"iid":345587,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Rollout of `ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs`","description":"\u003c!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [the bug fix](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341561) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs` feature flag.\n\n- Issue: #341561\n- MR: !81087\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::pipeline authoring\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_pipeline-authoring`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @furkanayhan \n- PM: `@dhershkovitch`\n\n## Stakeholders\n\n\u003c!--\nAre there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?\n\n- Name of a PM\n- The Support Team\n- The Delivery Team\n--\u003e\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe expect that the bug that [stated in the MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81087#screenshots-or-screen-recordings) will be disappeared.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nIf we did something wrong, the run order of CI jobs could be wrong or some jobs might not run at all.\n\nWe can disable the feature flag.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n\u003c!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant?

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be:\n\n- Executed in the `#production` slack channel.\n- Cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `ci_fix_order_of_subsequent_jobs` feature flag.

This is now enforced in the GitLab UI and any requests putting the target project as a project where the user is not maintainer will fail.\n\nThis check is not enforced if the same user uses the API endpoint `/projects/:id/import_project_members/:project_id` [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#import-project-members). As long as the user have maintainer access to the project with id `:id` the users can import members from any target `:project_id` as long as it is visible for the user. That is all public projects and any private project where the user have a role `Guest` or higher.\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a two users `user1` and `user2`  \n2. Log in as `user1` and create a public project `project1` in the users namespace `user1`  \n3. Make a note of the project ID, we call it `ID1`  \n4. Log in as `user2` and create a private project `project2`  \n5. Make a note of the project ID, we call it `ID2`  \n6. Go to https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens and create an access token for `user2`, lets call it `TOKEN1`  \n7. Send this request in a terminal (replacing \u003cTOKEN\u003e, \u003cID2\u003e and \u003cID1\u003e)  \n   ```  \n   curl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: \u003cTOKEN1\u003e\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/\u003cID2\u003e/import_project_members/\u003cID1\u003e\"  \n   ```  \n8. Go to https://gitlab.com/user2/project2/-/project_members and verify that `user1` is imported from the public project where `user2` is not a member\n\n#####  Impact\n\nImporting members is supposed to be an action that is restricted to users who are maintainers on both target projects. The API allows users to bypass this restriction.\n\n\n#####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe API endpoint does not validate the role of the requester as the UI does\n\n#####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe API should work as the functionality in the UI\n\n#####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nImporting members is supposed to be an action that is restricted to users who are maintainers on both target projects. The API allows users to bypass this restriction.\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-12T06:25:44.389Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T13:54:30.726Z","closed_at":"2022-01-12T11:42:15.615Z","closed_by":{"id":5054702,"username":"vdesousa","name":"Vitor Meireles De Sousa","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f44d19f10d5b0c54a02e79c13812ff77?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vdesousa"},"labels":["HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-284","devops::plan","group::project management","priority::4","section::dev","security","security-backlog::review-complete","severity::4","type::bug","workflow::awaiting security release"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"}],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4826728,"username":"m_frankiewicz","name":"Magdalena Frankiewicz","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca314fa77051f58ced6e3e5bf7f0dd48?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-01-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345564","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345564","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345564/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345564/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345564","relative":"#345564","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345564"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97213190,"iid":345561,"project_id":278964,"title":"Remove vulnerability_occurrences_location_temp_index temporary index","description":"## Why are we doing this work\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/72788 introduced background migration to populate `location` in `vulnerability_occurrences` that contains nil values.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [project-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --project=gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- If you're using [user-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --user=\u003cyour-username\u003e \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be:\n\n- Executed in the `#production` slack channel.\n- Cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [ ] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e true`\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set \u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-11T11:39:49.569Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T04:50:18.652Z","closed_at":"2022-02-24T04:50:18.614Z","closed_by":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"labels":["feature flag","feature::addition","missed:14.6","missed:14.7","missed:14.8","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"}],"author":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":113870,"username":"iamphill","name":"Phil Hughes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/533a51534470a11062df393543eab649?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/iamphill"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345491","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":6},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"6 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345491","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345491/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345491/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345491","relative":"#345491","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345491"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97163015,"iid":345488,"project_id":278964,"title":"Enable certain features by default for dev and testing","description":"Corrective action from issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345417\n\n\u003e For development or test environments, can we find ways to enable certain features by default?

They're typically used to populate a Feature\nEpic.

https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/threat-management/planning/diagram.html#plan\n--\u003e\n\n## Why are we doing this work\n\nThe first iteration of OS dependency report for Container Scanning relies on running the scanner twice: one for the vulnerabilities (reported in `gl-container-scanning.json`) and one for the dependencies (reported in `gl-dependency-scanning.json`).\n\nWhenever possible, we'd like to run the scanner only once, and then report the findings/dependencies accordingly.\n\n\n## Relevant links\n\n*

update analyzer to generate additional report for that and CI/CD template for Container Scanning to support that.\n\nFor Trivy, we can use `--list-all-pkgs` flag to generate `dependency-scanning` report that we can use in `Security \u0026 Compliance -\u003e Dependency List`.\n\n\n- [x] Documentation: add documentation to [Container Scanning section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/) that the analyzer is performing Dependency Scanning scan by default and add information about ability to disable it,\n- [x] Feature flag: no feature flag, but we could consider adding a separate variable to the analyzer to be able to disable the Dependency List generation\n- [-] Performance:\n- [-] Testing:\n\n\n## Implementation plan\n- [x] ~backend ~\"ci::templates\" modify `Security/Container-Scanning` template to accept additional artifact for `dependency-scanning` report,\n- [x] ~backend extend [analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning) with additional ability to perform scan to get a list of all packages installed in the container and

It should be not null.\n* ~~Update GraphQL creation mutation to require the input of a token.~~\n  * In hindsight, this won't work for existing destinations.

Then the changes are not reflected in the \"code owners\" and in the count within the \"changes\" tab.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a GitLab SaaS project and add three branches to the repo (e.g. master, developer, 6.0.0)\n1. Add two files (for the purpose of demonstration, e.g. ListLength.py and factornumber.py) to the repo.\n1. Add two different \"code owners\" for each file\n1. Ensure that the branches are all merged/synched from master\n1. Commit a single line change to file \"factornumber.py\" on branch 6.0.0 and commit the same change to the same file on the master branch so that they are the same.\n1. On the master branch commit a single file change to file \"ListLength.py\".\n1. Create an MR from branch master to developer, note there are two code owners one for each python file where changes have occurred, as shown below:\n![image](/uploads/a6a701beff9f85e58b21d6ee1741216a/image.png)\n1. Note that the changes being applied to both files\n![image](/uploads/912a4a324a161ab85022105b0b6179ee/image.png)\n1. Do not complete the merge, instead “Edit” the MR and change merge request from master to branch 6.0.0 \n![image](/uploads/b2f02c8d2bd6405f022e40f71ad6e57e/image.png)\n1. Now note that even though only one file will now be updated “ListLength.py” that the code owner of “factornumber.py” is still highlighted.\n![image](/uploads/c5293389d3237bd85d5b7c7474f699d2/image.png)\n1. Also, note that the “Changes” tab is showing 2 changes even though only one change is performed:\n![image](/uploads/94c62a34fab82fc3dbe04c69add85f9c/image.png)\n\n### Example Project\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-gold/johnlyttle/code-owner-test\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen editing the Merge Request it should only display the \"code owner\" of the file \"ListLength.py\" as this is the only file being updated. The \"changes\" tab should display a count of 1 instead of 2 as only 1 change is being merged.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWhen the edited MR is updated, it should reflect the correct status of \"code owners\" and \"changes\"\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e GitLab Enterprise Edition 14.5.0-pre 1024c08f50f","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-10T15:48:24.589Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T14:56:09.400Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T16:30:55.316Z","closed_by":{"id":2935693,"username":"phikai","name":"Kai Armstrong","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5d6a63b41cbeb3ea4cccda82e758e1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/phikai"},"labels":["Category:Source Code Management","Code Owners","Deliverable","backend","customer","devops::create","group::code review","merge requests","missed-SLO","priority::2","section::dev","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":4901936,"username":"dskim_gitlab","name":"Sincheol (David) Kim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/84a984a56c54d1d31338678421cecc32?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dskim_gitlab"}],"author":{"id":8108602,"username":"jlyttle","name":"John Lyttle","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8108602/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jlyttle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4901936,"username":"dskim_gitlab","name":"Sincheol (David) Kim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/84a984a56c54d1d31338678421cecc32?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dskim_gitlab"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345401","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345401","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345401/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/345401/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#345401","relative":"#345401","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#345401"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97110202,"iid":345398,"project_id":278964,"title":"[Feature flag] Enable Switch between editing in Content Editor and raw Markdown","description":"## Summary\n\nThis issue is to rollout [Switch between editing in Content Editor and raw Markdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342729) on production,\nthat is currently behind the `wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown` feature flag.\n\nThis feature allows \n\n### Related issues\n\n- [Design exploration for toggling between Content Editor and editing source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341512)\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: @gl-editor \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_create_editor`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @ealcantara @himkp \n- PM: @ericschurter \n\n## Stakeholders\n\n- @mle \n- @oregand \n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nThis section describes the current behavior of editing Markdown in the Wiki and the new behavior after enabling the feature flag. \n\n### Current behavior\n\nWe will change the mechanism to switch between the Content Editor and the Classic Markdown Editor in Wikis. Currently, the Wiki edit page displays a prompt to encourage the user to try the Content Editor. This prompt can’t be permanently dismissed. \n\nWhen switching back to the Classic Markdown Editor, the Wiki edit form doesn’t preserve the changes in the Content Editor and rolls back to the unmodified markdown that was loaded from the backend. \n\n### New Behavior\n\n- The user toggles between the Classic Markdown Editor and the Content Editor by clicking the \"Switch to rich text\" / \"Edit source\" link buttons.  \n- The Wiki edit form will save the last editor chosen by the user as a web browser preference in local storage. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n| Before | After |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![before-one](/uploads/21e1d94c1576ab29e226d63c4def9513/before-one.png)  | ![image](/uploads/e4950a2670f4513bcb286b1c1a3ccc46/image.png) |\n| ![before-two](/uploads/260a3b95aabc6c3f20492fb0429800ee/before-two.png)  |  |\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n- The main risk with this change is that the user may report unexpected changes in the Wiki page’s content when switching between the Content Editor and the Classic Markdown Editor. \n- The user may report that the default editor is not their preferred choice. \n\nWe can rollback the feature flag and switch to the previous approach to switch between the Content Editor and Classic Markdown editor. \n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- Stay alert to reports in the [Content Editor feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332629)\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown true --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown true --staging`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown true`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown true`\n- [x] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be:\n\n- Executed in the `#production` slack channel.\n- Cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_TEAM_NAME`).\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set wiki_switch_between_content_editor_raw_markdown false\n```\n\n## Availability and Testing\n\nPlease assign the SET (@a_mcdonald) to the MR that removes the feature flag as we will need to remove the ff flow from the `content_editor_spec` E2E test (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346149 for more details) to prevent it from breaking in pipelines.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-10T15:32:57.701Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T07:01:26.114Z","closed_at":"2022-03-30T13:12:42.744Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique

`:group_security_policies` feature flag.\n\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::container security\" \n- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_protect_container_security`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @aturinske (Alexander Turinske)\n- PM: Sam White\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\n- a user can create a group-level scan execution security policy and it will show up on all the sub-groups/projects\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n- the user will not be able to create a group-level scan execution security policy and it will not show up on all the sub-groups/projects\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- #is_this_known\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set group_security_policies true --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set group_security_policies true --staging`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Specific rollout on production\n\n- Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to both production and canary.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-your-feature\u003e`\n- If you're using [group-actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), you must enable the feature on these entries:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-org group_security_policies true`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set --group=gitlab-com group_security_policies true`\n- [ ] Verify that the feature works on the specific entries. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [ ] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nFor visibility, all `/chatops` commands that target production should be:\n\n- Executed in the `#production` slack channel.\n- Cross-posted (with the command results) to the responsible team's slack channel (`#g_protect_container_security`).\n\n- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4425) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [ ] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `group_security_policies`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345322` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `group_security_policies` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [ ] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [ ] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [ ] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [ ] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete group_security_policies --dev`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete group_security_policies --staging`\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature delete group_security_policies`\n- [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set group_security_policies false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-09T19:49:32.799Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T03:21:34.670Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T03:36:04.033Z","closed_by":{"id":5537154,"username":"aturinske","name":"Alexander Turinske","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5537154/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aturinske"},"labels":["[deprecated] Accepting merge requests","devops::govern","feature flag","feature::addition","group::security policies","section::sec","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
