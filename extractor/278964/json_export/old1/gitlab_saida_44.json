[{"id":96593916,"iid":344667,"project_id":278964,"title":"Assign custom Apdex targets for CI jobs endpoints","description":"# Context\n\nWe need to set custom Apdex targets for Rails controller and REST API endpoints related to CI jobs as part of our Q4 scalability initiative for our ~SaaS offering: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343561, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1315\n\nThe default SLI is 1 second. We need to determine where we will set a custom SLI (up to 5 seconds). Ideally, high traffic endpoints used directly by users (not as a part of a background process) should have a high priority set (\u003c 1 second). We may need to set low traffic, slow endpoints to a low priority. Follow these steps to find the right priority for each endpoint: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#how-to-adjust-the-urgency\n\n# Technical details\n\nREST API CI jobs endpoints: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/jobs.html\n\nController endpoints exist both in job specific controllers like `Projects::BuildsController` and in the actions of other CI controllers such as `Projects::PipelinesController#builds` and `Ci::ExternalPullRequests::CreatePipelineWorker`\n\nInstructions on setting custom Apdex targets: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#how-to-adjust-the-urgency\n\n## Implementation table\n\n| Description | Link |  Milestone | Timeframe |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| **Assign custom Apdex targets for CI jobs endpoints** | :point_left: You are here | %\"14.9\" | ~\"FY22::Q4\" |\n| Set low urgency as Apdex targets for remaining PE endpoints | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360273  | %\"15.0\"  | ~\"FY23::Q1\"  |\n| Remove ignored_components from PE error budget | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348552 | %\"15.0\"  | ~\"FY23::Q2\"  |\n| Introduce Keyset pagination for `GET /api/:version/projects/:id/jobs` API endpoint | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362172 | %\"15.5\" | ~\"FY23::Q3\" |\n| Backend: Improve performance of GraphqlController#execute | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361377 | TBD | ~\"FY23::Q3\" |\n| Backend: Improve performance of PATCH /api/:version/jobs/:id/trace | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353802 | TBD | ~\"FY23::Q3\" |\n| Assign custom Apdex targets for remaining PE endpoints | https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348554 | TBD | ~\"FY23::Q3\" |\n\n## Steps\n\n- [x] 1. Locate all CI jobs REST API and controller endpoints\n    - For now, using the [Elastic dashboard](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/visualize#/create?type=table\u0026indexPattern=7092c4e2-4eb5-46f2-8305-a7da2edad090\u0026_a=h@304d83b\u0026_g=(time:(from:'now-7d',to:'now'))) is the easiest way to get to the list of endpoints. As written in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#error-budget-attribution-and-ownership). So from the Stage Group Dashboard, in the error budget attribution row, follow the \"Puma Apdex\" link to see a list of endpoints and the duration targets they meet or exceed.\n- [ ] 2. Select a target duration for each endpoint by consulting [the duration table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1315#what-target-duration-options-are-available) and following the [steps for determining a custom duration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#how-to-adjust-the-urgency)\n- [x] 3. Where the duration we want differs from the default (1 second), add a custom target duration to the endpoint. **Involve a [Scalability team member](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/scalability/#team-members) in the review**","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-02T17:05:48.292Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T18:07:38.464Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T18:22:28.141Z","closed_by":{"id":4626651,"username":"allison.browne","name":"Allison Browne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bc33904c3bd3f2dce3db4e5af4ad1ae?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/allison.browne"},"labels":["Category:Continuous Integration","Deliverable","FY23::Q1","OKR","Verify::P2","backend","devops::verify","group::pipeline execution","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2204140,"iid":71,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-08-26T19:11:46.841Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T13:29:17.028Z","due_date":"2022-03-17","start_date":"2022-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71"},"assignees":[{"id":4626651,"username":"allison.browne","name":"Allison Browne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bc33904c3bd3f2dce3db4e5af4ad1ae?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/allison.browne"}],"author":{"id":4059128,"username":"avielle","name":"Avielle Wolfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4059128/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/avielle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4626651,"username":"allison.browne","name":"Allison Browne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bc33904c3bd3f2dce3db4e5af4ad1ae?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/allison.browne"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344667","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":2},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"2 of 3 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344667","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344667/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344667/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344667","relative":"#344667","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344667"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":7968,"epic":{"id":511907,"iid":7968,"title":"Investigate PE error budget","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7968","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96590089,"iid":344664,"project_id":278964,"title":"[New Audit Event] Audit event for when streaming audit event settings are created, changed, or deleted","description":"\u003c!-- Audit Event documentation: See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html --\u003e\n\n## Audit need\n\n\u003c!-- Describe the real-world use case for the audit event you want to introduce, and explain the closest thing that GitLab already captures. --\u003e\n\nConfiguring Streaming Audit Events means that audit data will be sent to a new location.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before global rollout\n\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in development can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the oncall SRE by using the `@sre-oncall` Slack alias.\n- [x] Ensure that documentation has been updated ([More info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#features-that-became-enabled-by-default)).\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on GitLab.com.\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#support_gitlab-com` and your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on production\n\nAll `/chatops` commands that target production should be done in the `#production` slack channel for visibility.\n\n- [x] [Incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) the feature.\n  - If the feature flag in code has [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform **actor-based** rollout.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files \u003crollout-percentage\u003e --actors`\n  - If the feature flag in code does **NOT** have [an actor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-actors), perform time-based rollout (**random** rollout).\n    - [ ] `/chatops run feature set api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files \u003crollout-percentage\u003e`\n  - Enable the feature globally on production environment.\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature set api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files true`\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### (Optional) Release the feature with the feature flag\n\nIf you're still unsure whether the feature is [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release)\nbut want to release it in the current milestone, you can change the default state of the feature flag to be enabled.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n- [x] Create a merge request with the following changes. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Set the `default_enabled` attribute in [the feature flag definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#feature-flag-definition-and-validation) to `true`.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the default-enabling MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [ ] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-default-enabling-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Set the next milestone to this rollout issue for scheduling [the flag removal](#release-the-feature).\n- [ ] (Optional) You can create a separate issue for scheduling the steps below to [Release the feature](#release-the-feature).\n    - [ ] Set the title to \"[Feature flag] Cleanup `api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files`\".\n    - [ ] Execute the `/copy_metadata \u003cthis-rollout-issue-link\u003e` quick action to copy the labels from this rollout issue.\n    - [ ] Link this rollout issue as a related issue.\n    - [ ] Close this rollout issue.\n\n**WARNING:** This approach has the downside that it makes it difficult for us to\n[clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up) the flag.\nFor example, on-premise users could disable the feature on their GitLab instance. But when you\nremove the flag at some point, they suddenly see the feature as enabled and they can't roll it back\nto the previous behavior. To avoid this potential breaking change, use this approach only for urgent\nmatters.\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe [clean up](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#cleaning-up)\nshould be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the\ncodebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files` feature flag. Ask for review and merge it.\n    - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase.\n    - [x] Remove the YAML definitions for the feature from the repository.\n    - [x] Create [a changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/#changelog).\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both production and canary.\n      If the merge request was deployed before [the code cutoff](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/#self-managed-releases-1),\n      the feature can be officially announced in a release blog post.\n    - [x] `/chatops run auto_deploy status \u003cmerge-commit-of-cleanup-mr\u003e`\n- [x] Close [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) to indicate the feature will be released in the current milestone.\n- [x] Clean up the feature flag from all environments by running these chatops command in `#production` channel:\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files --dev`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files --staging`\n    - [x] `/chatops run feature delete api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files`\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by running the following Chatops command:\n\n```\n/chatops run feature set api_v3_commits_skip_diff_files false\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-02T02:01:54.075Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:20:26.176Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T00:17:58.895Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"labels":["auto updated","automation:ml","automation:ml wrong","devops::manage","feature flag","group::integrations","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344617","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":49,"completed_count":38},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"38 of 49 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344617","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344617/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344617/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344617","relative":"#344617","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344617"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6913,"epic":{"id":370101,"iid":6913,"title":"Integrations Error Budgets","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6913","group_id":9970},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96544925,"iid":344613,"project_id":278964,"title":"Automate Gitpod Docker image testing and promotion","description":"# Overview\n\nOur Gitpod integration uses GDK under the hood which is built into a Docker image called `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:stable` (note the **`stable`** tag. The `stable` tag is created via a manual process that begins with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60384 where we manually test the nightly built `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:main` (note the **`main`** tag) image and promote to `stable` if the manual tests pass. \n\nHere's the steps we currently issue to make this happen:\n\n1. Visit https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60384\n1. Rebase `gdk-gitpod-integration-branch` branch that's associated with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60384\n1. Open https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/gdk-gitpod-integration-branch in a new tab to bring up the tree view for the `gdk-gitpod-integration-branch` branch which then displays the 'Gitpod' button.\n1. Click the 'Gitpod' button which will create a new instance using `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/gitpod-workspace:main` (note the **`main`** tag).\n1. After a few moments, the Gitpod interface will appear as will some familiar GDK output in the log window at the bottom of the page.\n1. Back on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60384, we create a new comment using the template provided in step 3 at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60384#steps-to-test.\n1. We then perform each test.\n1.

This was [announced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64432) in %\"14.0\" and final removal will take place in %\"15.0\" \n\nThe implicit grant has known security flaws that are known since the inception of OAuth and are mentioned in the 2012 [OAuth RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2). Back then it was the only solution for pure client-side apps (SPA, mobile, etc) that rely only on 3rd party servers for authentication, but nowadays we have the PKCE grant which is the modern and safer alternative.\n\nThe latest [OAuth security recommendations](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-16.html#name-implicit-grant) from IETF is also clear on the subject (emphasis mine)\n\n\u003e The implicit grant (response type \"token\") and other response types causing the authorization server to issue access tokens in the authorization response are vulnerable to access token leakage and access token replay as described in Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3, and Section 4.6.\n\u003e\n\u003e Moreover, no viable mechanism exists to cryptographically bind access tokens issued in the authorization response to a certain client as it is recommended in Section 2.2. This makes replay detection for such access tokens at resource servers impossible.\n\u003e\n\u003e **In order to avoid these issues, clients SHOULD NOT use the implicit grant** (response type \"token\") or other response types issuing access tokens in the authorization response, unless access token injection in the authorization response is prevented and the aforementioned token leakage vectors are mitigated.\n\nThe `implicit` grant is removed from OAuth in [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) (still in draft).\n\n### Breaking Change\n\n\u003c!-- Is this a breaking change or not? If so, please add instructions for how users can update their workflow. --\u003e\n\nYes\n\n### Affected Topology\n\nBoth SaaS and Self-Managed\n\n### Affected Tier\n\n\u003c!--\nWhich tier is this feature available in?\n\n* Free\n* Premium\n* Ultimate\n--\u003e\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [ ] @mention your stage's stable counterparts on this issue. For example, Customer Support, Customer Success (Technical Account Manager), Product Marketing Manager.\n  - To see who the stable counterparts are for a product team visit [product categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/)\n       - If there is no stable counterpart listed for Sales/CS please mention `@timtams`\n       - If there is no stable counterpart listed for Support please @mention `@gitlab-com/support/managers`\n       - If there is no stable counterpart listed for Marketing please mention `@williamchia`\n\n- [ ] @mention your GPM so that they are aware of planned deprecations. The goal is to have reviews happen at least two releases before the final removal of the feature or introduction of a breaking change.\n\n### Deprecation Milestone\n\nAnnounced 2021-09-22\n\n### Planned Removal  Milestone\n\n%\"15.0\" \n\n### Links\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/12946\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64432","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-01T23:39:47.268Z","updated_at":"2022-12-29T03:09:11.998Z","closed_at":"2022-05-11T14:47:34.779Z","closed_by":{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"},"labels":["Category:Authentication and Authorization","candidate::15.0","deprecation","devops::manage","documentation","group::authentication and authorization","maintenance::removal","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::dev","security","severity::3","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2095271,"iid":65,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-06-08T15:35:34.814Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:35.115Z","due_date":"2022-05-17","start_date":"2022-04-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/65"},"assignees":[{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"}],"author":{"id":9425173,"username":"hsutor","name":"Hannah Sutor","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9425173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hsutor"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9717295,"username":"bdenkovych","name":"Bogdan Denkovych","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9717295/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bdenkovych"},"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-02-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344609","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 2 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344609","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344609/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/344609/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#344609","relative":"#344609","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#344609"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96533588,"iid":344589,"project_id":278964,"title":"Connect app: Consolidate known limitations into a single alert","description":"### Problem \nThe Jira Connect App has known limitations that are currently listed in the footer area and are always present.

test report, we are still making a request to the API to get the test summary. On page render, we already know whether the pipeline has test reports or not because it is [passed as a boolean to the Vue app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b574ddd8f6d5e8abc1648bfc5e4fdb86e7281c5c/app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/pipeline_test_details.js#L27). We should use that boolean to not fetch the test summary if we already know there aren't any tests.\n\nIf we pass the boolean to the `test_reports.vue` file and [check the boolean before we fetch the report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b574ddd8f6d5e8abc1648bfc5e4fdb86e7281c5c/app/assets/javascripts/pipelines/components/test_reports/test_reports.vue#L30), that should be enough.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-01T18:52:17.541Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T18:26:15.780Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T18:26:15.764Z","closed_by":{"id":3029776,"username":"shampton","name":"Scott Hampton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3029776/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shampton"},"labels":["Category:Code Testing and Coverage","GitLab Core","devops::verify","frontend","good for new contributors","group::pipeline insights","section::ops","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

doesn't support advanced protection like [protected branches API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_branches.html#protect-repository-branches) and [protected environments API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_environments.html#protect-repository-environments):\n* it is only possible to set role access level via `create_access_level` but \n* it is NOT possible to set `allowed_to_create` by `group_id` or `user_id`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nImplement the ability to also use `group_id` or `user_id` to protect tags like for [protected environments API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_environments.html#protect-repository-environments) and [protected branches API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_branches.html#protect-repository-branches).\n\nEssentially, after this would be introduced the documentation would look as proposed in

If you are using an older version of GitLab, this \nwill also determine whether the bug is fixed in a more recent version. --\u003e\n\n[GitLab Audit Events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/audit_events), if you are a developer\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what actually happens. --\u003e\n\nThe filter bar will be missing for the **Developer** role.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n\u003c!-- Describe what you should see instead. --\u003e\n\nThe filter bar should be present regardless of role.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\u003c!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code\n as it's tough to read otherwise. --\u003e\n\n![image](/uploads/8a9cf54efdb3fba9b6ac4ef1ab0f6a61/image.png)\n\n### Output of checks\n\n\u003c!-- If you are reporting a bug on GitLab.com, write: This bug happens on GitLab.com --\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab environment information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to GitLab environment info\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Results of GitLab application Check\n\n\u003c!--  Input any relevant GitLab application check information if needed. --\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for output related to the GitLab application check\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production SANITIZE=true`)\n\n(we will only investigate if the tests are passing)\n\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n~frontend \n\n1. When a `Developer` views the project or group audit events:\n   1. Show the filtered search component.\n   1. Add a token for the current user.\n   1. Set `readonly` to `true` on the filtered search.
