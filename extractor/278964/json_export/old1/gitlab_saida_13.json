We should prevent us from using the legacy approach.\n\n## Context discussion thread\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83558#note_895662565\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n**Possible solution:**\n\n1. Introduce argument to the lambda scope of association so direct preloading is not possible as mentioned in https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html\n\n\u003e Note: Joining, eager loading and preloading of these associations is not possible. These operations happen before instance creation and the scope will be called with a nil argument.\n\n```ruby\n  # Introducing association argument to prevent direct preloading.\n  # Consider using Preloaders::Environments::DeploymentPreloader.new.execute_with_union instead.\n  has_one :last_deployment, -\u003e (environments) { success.ordered }, class_name: 'Deployment', inverse_of: :environment\n```\n\n1. Or even better consider moving `last_deployment` to a model class method instead of an association.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n1) Introduce argument to the lambda scope of association so direct preloading is not possible.\n2) Moving the associations to class method results in ` ActiveRecord::AssociationNotFoundError: Association named 'last_deployment' was not found on Environment;` and to avoid it we will have to do further refactor to existing code areas. If required we can create a low priority issue to capture this work in the future and it can be worked on once the [serializer fragility epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8433) is closed as some of these associations may not be required then.\n\n### POC\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/97963/diffs","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-01T10:18:27.559Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T10:59:48.496Z","closed_at":"2022-11-24T10:59:48.444Z","closed_by":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"labels":["Category:Environment Management","Release::P3","backend","backend-weight::1","devops::release","group::release","missed:15.5","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"}],"author":{"id":758045,"username":"shinya.maeda","name":"Shinya Maeda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/758045/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shinya.maeda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9253328,"username":"bala.kumar","name":"Bala Kumar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9253328/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bala.kumar"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369240","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369240","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369240/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369240/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#369240","relative":"#369240","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#369240"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112589579,"iid":369238,"project_id":278964,"title":"Assess accuracy of semver_dialects using gemnasium/vrange","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe'd like to use [semver_dialects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/vulnerability-research/foss/semver_dialects)\nto implement Continuous Scanning in the backend,\nand to support all the languages and package managers Gemnasium (Dependency Scanning) supports today.\nHowever, `semver_dialects` might not be as accurate as Gemnasium's [vrange](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/tree/master/vrange) library,\nand this might result in false positives and false negatives.\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363073#note_970572115\n\n### Proposal\n\nLeverage [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) to compare `semver_dialects` to `vrange`, report discrepancies, and create follow-up issues to address them.\n\nFor each YAML file of `gemnasium-db`, do the following:\n\n1. Query the package registry to list package versions.\n1. Find affected, fixed, and non-affected versions using `gemnasium/vrange`.\n1. Find affected, fixed, and non-affected versions using `semver_dialects`.\n1. Report inconsistencies.\n\nWe can either query the API of the package registry or use the package manager to list the versions of a package.\n\nTo find the affected and non-affected versions, go through the versions listed on the package registry, and evaluate the `affected_range` of the YAML file.\n\nAlso, find package versions that match the `fixed_versions` of the YAML file.\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220286#note_1044076127\n\n### Implementation plan\n\nThe proposal above is likely the best way to do an assessment of the `semver_dialects` gem. The solution will also allow our team to facilitate https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369239+.\n\n- [x] add vrange [command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/cmd/gemnasium/main.go#L69) to gemnasium allowing queries given a range and a version\n- [x] create a project for running this test\n  - ruby optimal here since `semver_dialects` is a ruby gem and this matching capability will be used in the rails monolith\n- [x] check out advisory db\n- [x] iterate over each package manager directory (e.g. `pypi`, `gem`)\n  - iterate over each directory corresponding to a package\n    - get list of official versions for package (to simplify configuration try to use docker as much as possible; this can be used in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369239+ under docker-dind image)\n    - iterate over each advisory\n      - check `version` of package against `advisory.affected_range`\n        - using `vrange`\n        - using `semver_dialects`\n      - [x] capture matches, mismatches and which range functionality they belong to using a greppable format\n        - capture to db that can be saved to disk and queries via `jq` (for example)\n- [x] commit code used to generate this check to make it repeatable for new semver types - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/semver-assessment\n- [x] report results - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369238#note_1114975584\n- [ ] create follow-up

GraphQL `feature_flag` property","description":"## About\n\nWe currently have 2 methods of using feature flags in GraphQL:\n\n- `feature_flag` property ([doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html#feature_flag-property)).\n- Toggle the value/behaviour with a feature flag ([doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html#toggle-the-value-of-a-field)).\n\nWe also have a related `alpha` property ([doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html#marking-schema-items-as-alpha)) that marks the item as `@deprecated` and appends the description with a notice that it should not be used. \n\n## Problem\n\n`feature_flag` has always had a problem where when the flag is toggled on, the field is \"released\", even though the flag can be toggled off again. \n\nWe [currently advise](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/d04230de211dca843ecfeec0d1645611b18768a2/doc/development/api_graphql_styleguide.md#frontend-and-backend-feature-flag-strategies) not to use

methods of feature flagging items, plus a new related `alpha` property, is confusing.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThere's an opportunity to remove `feature_flag`, and consolidate these items to:\n\n- Toggle the value/behaviour with a feature flag.\n- `alpha`\n\nThese two allow for these scenarios:\n\n| Scenario | header |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| New volatile schema item with a flag | Toggle + `alpha` |\n| New volatile schema item with no flag | `alpha` |\n| New stable schema item with a flag | Toggle |\n| New stable schema item with no flag | - |\n\nWe would replace all current usage of `feature_flag` with a value/behaviour toggle behind a flag + mark the field as `alpha` if the flag is disabled by default.\n\nWe will need to update `RuboCop::Cop::Gitlab::MarkUsedFeatureFlags`

Null or unchanged object","description":"Follow up issue on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/93283#note_1045051673\n\nShould there be a standard way to return errors in mutations. In some places we return `null` in the fields available on the mutation, if the mutation has errors. In others, we allow to query the unchanged object as part of the response of the mutation.\n\n## Initial discussion\nDo we have this as the standard way to handle errors? Perhaps @gitlab-org/graphql-experts can chime in? I don't see anything in the GraphQL spec about this, other than something that might apply? Of course this is talking about top level errors\n```\nIf an error was encountered during the execution that prevented a valid response, the data entry in the response should be null\n```\nAlso from the `graphql` ruby gem we have [this](https://graphql-ruby.org/mutations/mutation_errors#nullable-mutation-payload-fields).\n\nUnless there's a better reason I'm not seeing, perhaps it's better to return null? We might save some DB queries, reduce the response size and also, we could expect that the frontend has a saved state of the object before calling the mutation, right? So, why fetch it unchanged from a failed mutation?\n\n## Example mutation\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  issueSetConfidential(input: iid: \"2\", projectPath: \"flightjs/Flight\", confidential: true) {\n    issue {\n      id\n      confidential\n    }\n    errors\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Response with original object unchanged\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"issueSetConfidential\": {\n        \"issue\": {\n          \"id\": \"gid://gitlab/Issue/42\",\n          \"confidential\": false,\n        },\n        \"errors\": [\n          \"Confidential confidential parent can not be used if there are not-confidential children.\"\n        ],\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n```\n\n### Response with null `issue` if the mutation contains errors\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"issueSetConfidential\": {\n        \"issue\": null,\n        \"errors\": [\n          \"Confidential confidential parent can not be used if there are not-confidential children.\"\n        ],\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-29T17:11:14.577Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T20:47:53.766Z","closed_at":"2022-10-26T20:47:44.639Z","closed_by":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"labels":["Category:Integrations","GraphQL","auto updated","devops::manage","documentation","group::integrations","maintenance::refactor","meta","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"}],"author":{"id":8110537,"username":"mcelicalderonG","name":"Mario Celi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8110537/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mcelicalderonG"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2702368,"username":".luke","name":"Luke Duncalfe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2702368/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/.luke"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369120","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369120","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369120/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964/issues/369120/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/278964","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#369120","relative":"#369120","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab#369120"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112516343,"iid":369116,"project_id":278964,"title":"Backend: Remove `masked` and `protected` from the VariableInterface and add to Types instead.","description":"Follow-up from: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362934#note_1040614360\n\nThe `Variable` interface has the `masked` and `protected` fields.

This will be achieved following the gradual migration plan detailed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/374.\n\nThe migration is now 90%+ complete, with just a few customers AND `gitlab-org` left. This issue is to plan, coordinate and execute the migration of all `gitlab-org` container repositories that exist on the old Container Registry platform to the new one.\n\n## Data\n\nAvailable in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uf2jhpQnAE-aYOgT--qFoUEXV0S_HM5sM_REPGr3_sE/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet, including:\n\n* List of all repositories;\n* Current tag count for each repository;\n* Estimated* pre-import (read/write allowed) duration;\n* Estimated* final import (read-only) duration;\n* Top 10 repositories in overall activity during the last 7 days and the last weekend;\n* Same as above but for write activity only.\n\n\u003csub\u003e* Estimate based on the observed duration for a sample of recently migrated VIP repositories. The actual duration for each `gitlab-org` repository may vary.\u003c/sub\u003e\n\n### Highlights\n\n* 3345 repositories in total;\n* Only 227 have more than 100 tags;\n* Only 84 have more than 1k tags;\n* Only 13 have more than 10k tags;\n* The largest is `gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-ee-qa`, with 34k tags;\n* The majority of large (20k+ tags) repositories are under `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror`;\n* Only 11 repositories are *expected* to require more than 5 minutes for the final import step (where we block writes). None is expected to take more than 10 minutes;\n* 3282 out of 3345 (\\~98%) are expected to require less than 30 seconds for the final import step. 30 seconds is the time that the Docker client will keep retrying an image push in case the request is rejected. So, in theory, CI pipelines trying to push images to these repositories *while* they are being migrated would eventually succeed without needing to be manually retried;\n* All the 13 largest (10k+ tags) repositories have identical usage patterns with low to no write activity during weekends.\n\n### Largest repositories (10k+ tags)\n\n| Path | Tags | Estimated pre-import duration (read/write) | Estimated final import duration (read-only) |\n|------|------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| `gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-ee-qa` | 34323 | 23:50:08 | 00:08:35 |\n| `gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-assets-ee` | 32047 | 22:15:18 | 00:08:01 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror/gitlab-ee` | 30159 | 20:56:38 | 00:07:32 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-geo-logcursor` | 29315 | 20:21:28 | 00:07:20 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-rails-ee` | 29310 | 20:21:15 | 00:07:20 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-sidekiq-ee` | 29299 | 20:20:48 | 00:07:19 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-workhorse-ee` | 29291 | 20:20:28 | 00:07:19 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-webservice-ee` | 28762 | 19:58:25 | 00:07:11 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-shell` | 28627 | 19:52:48 | 00:07:09 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-toolbox-ee` | 28219 | 19:35:48 | 00:07:03 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-pages` | 24493 | 17:00:33 | 00:06:07 |\n| `gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper` | 13473 | 09:21:23 | 00:03:22 |\n| `gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror/gitlab-ee-qa` | 12631 | 08:46:18 | 00:03:09 |\n\n## Plan\n\n1. Migrate all 13 repositories above 10k tags across two weekends. None is expected to take more than 24h to fully migrate (pre+final import), and the system can migrate up to 40 in parallel. So we could do it all in a single weekend. However:\n   * These are likely the most critical ones for internal operations;\n   * Mainly: some of these repositories are responsible for a non-negligible share of the overall registry API traffic. I don't like the idea of shifting that load from the old to the new registry in one go.\n1. Migrate the remaining 3332 in no specific order (randomly picked) from Tuesday to Thursday in the weekdays between the two weekends above. This gives us a \"silent\" period of 24h on Monday and Friday (while everyone is around) to detect and react to any problems. Technically, at the maximum capacity (40), we could migrate all of them in a couple of hours. Still, we can reduce capacity to slow things down for additional peace of mind (being overcautious).\n\n### Communication\n\n* Reach out to the team(s) that own the largest repositories to let them know about the migration and see if there are any concerns about doing it on a specific weekend;\n* Post on `#whats-happening-at-gitlab` before starting the migration of the remaining 3332 during the week. This is for awareness and to give people a point of contact (`#f_container-registry`) in case they see something odd;\n\nThe migration is at 94%, with over 1.5M repositories done by now, so I think we don't need something special here.\n\n#### FAQ\n\n##### Can we anticipate when the read-only period will occur for a specific repository?\n\nNo. It can happen at any time during the defined migration window.\n\n##### What happens if we have pipelines attempting to push images to a repository while it's being migrated?\n\nPushes will succeed as usual during the vast majority of the migration time (read/write period), they will only be blocked for the duration of the last portion (read-only period).\n\nIf using Docker (likely), the client will keep retrying for up to 30s. If the repository remains locked against writes for longer, you'll need to retry the failed pipelines.\n\nSee the `Data` section for the estimated time to migrate each of the largest repositories. See the [spreadsheet]((https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uf2jhpQnAE-aYOgT--qFoUEXV0S_HM5sM_REPGr3_sE/edit?usp=sharing)) for all others.\n\n##### Can we pull images from repositories while they are being migrated?\n\nYes. Pulls should continue to succeed, even during the last portion of the migration (where we block writes). Once the migration is complete, reads are redirected to the new registry. This is fully transparent, so you won't notice anything different (except that some requests will be faster).\n\n### Schedule\n\n#### Largest\n\n| Path | Owner | Date | Done | \n|------|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| `gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-ee-qa` | ~\"team::Quality Engineering\" | ~~August 20-21~~ September 10-11 |  |\n| `gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror/gitlab-ee` | ~\"Distribution:Build\"  | August 20-21 | :white_check_mark: | \n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-geo-logcursor` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | August 20-21 | :white_check_mark: |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-sidekiq-ee` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | ~~August 20-21~~ September 10-11 |  |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-toolbox-ee` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | August 20-21 | :white_check_mark: |\n| `gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper` | ~\"group::runner\" | August 20-21 | :white_check_mark: |\n| `gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-assets-ee` | ~\"Engineering Productivity\"  | August 27-28 | :white_check_mark: | \n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-rails-ee` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | August 27-28 | :white_check_mark: |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-workhorse-ee` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | August 27-28 | :white_check_mark: | \n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-webservice-ee` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | ~~August 27-28~~ September 10-11 |  |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-shell` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | August 27-28 | :white_check_mark: |\n| `gitlab-org/build/cng-mirror/gitlab-pages` | ~\"Distribution:Build\"  | August 27-28 | :white_check_mark: |\n| `gitlab-org/build/omnibus-gitlab-mirror/gitlab-ee-qa` | ~\"Distribution:Build\" | ~~August 27-28~~ September 10-11 |  |\n\n#### Remaining\n\nAugust 23-25.\n\n## Execution Plan\n\n#### August 20\n\n- [x] ~\"group::package\" increases the GC review delay from 24h to 48h (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2055)\n\n- [x] ~\"group::package\" enables the migration (if not already) and adds a comment to the [rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350543):\n\n  ```\n  /chatops run feature set container_registry_migration_phase2_enabled true\n  ```\n\n  Note that there is no need to adjust the tag count limit or the deny list, as we're bypassing the Rails enqueuer worker where those are validated.\n\n- [x] ~\"team::Delivery\" executes the [change request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7583) to kickoff the migration of repositories scheduled for this weekend.\n\n- [x] ~\"group::package\" occasionally checks the migration [logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/14fcfd60-1a55-11ed-8656-f5f2137823ba) (diving into the correlation ID for any specific pre/final import if needed) and [metrics](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/registry-migration/registry-migration-detail?orgId=1\u0026from=now-1h\u0026to=now) to monitor progress.

Some attack have different levels of success based on the response, which could potentially result in the finding having a different level of severity.\n\nFor example, check `78.1 OS Command Injection` could return `High` severity if it detected that a command ran successfully, and `Low` if it detected that the command ran with errors.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Each `match_response_attack` can have multiple matchers\n- Matchers should be evaluated in order of their definition (first defined, first evaluated)\n- If one matcher matches, then a finding should be created using the level of severity defined in the match definition. The following matchers should not be evaluated.\n- The description in the matcher should be appended to the end of the finding description (separated by a new line)\n\n\n### Example definition\n\nAn example of what a matcher definition looks like is the following:\n\n```yaml\nmatchers:\n  - description: |\n      This is a dangerous form of OS command injection\n    severity: \"High\"\n    match:\n      type: \"match\"\n      location: \"response_body\"\n      expression: \"...\"\n  - description: |\n      The payload was not executed, but appears to be used\n    severity: \"Low\"\n    match:\n      type: \"match\"\n      location: \"response_body\"\n      expression: \"...\"\n```\n\n### Implementation plan\n\n- [x] ~~Update the parser to parse all of the match locations (if https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367230 is complete)~~ (parsing is not complete)\n- [x] Update `MatchResponseAttack` to accept multiple matchers, and determine an attack to be successful if any of the matchers match\n- [x] Update `MatchResponseAttack` `IsSupported` to be supported if all matchers are supported\n- [x] Ensure the finding is created using the severity defined by the matcher","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-29T11:24:16.039Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T03:20:57.101Z","closed_at":"2022-08-19T18:55:16.502Z","closed_by":{"id":4312863,"username":"cam_swords","name":"Cameron

This performance bug is more noticeable in the context of more complex features like issues and Merge Requests. \n- We will continue adding more Vue components to the Content Editor. We need to make sure that the Content Editor can scale to our future needs.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nYou can open the Content Editor in Wikis and notice the delay. \n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- We should start by not rendering bubble menus unless they are active. \n- We should revisit other areas like the toolbar.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-28T16:27:56.326Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:02:02.563Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T15:27:29.606Z","closed_by":{"id":3540517,"username":"ealcantara","name":"Enrique

It describes known behaviour. Context is in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368961#note_1043076641). \u003c/summary\u003e\n\n[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n####  Summary\n\nAn owner/maintainer of a (premium +) top group can configure SAML SSO requirements for access to the group. See documentation [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/). If the group activate the setting \"Enforce SSO-only authentication for Git and Dependency Proxy activity for this group\" any user that does not have an active SSO session with the configured provider is restricted from accessing the group projects through Git actions.\n\nIn the docs for \"SSO enforcement\" [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/index.html#sso-enforcement) this is stated\n\n\u003e Credentials that are not tied to regular users (for example, project and group access tokens, and deploy keys) do not have the SSO check enforced. \n\nAs far as I can read in the docs `CI Job Tokens` [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html) should not fall in this category as they are tied to the user that initialized the pipeline.\n\nFor me the SSO enforcement for git actions blocks all attempts to clone using authentications like `personal access tokens`, but if I run a pipeline job in any arbitrary project I can use the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` from that job to check out the repository that is protected by SSO.\n\nFirst I thought that this might be related to the fix for SSO enforcement blocking pipeline schedules in the protected project (see [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339888) and [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76909)). But this MR seems to use a check for server generated requests on the `http` schema, and not anything to do with CI tokens. The fix tries to open up access for pipelines running \"inside the project\".\n\nA simple clone can be run like so:  \n```yml  \ndata:  \n  script:  git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}[@]gitlab.com/groupname/projectname.git ; ls ./hack  \n```\n\n####  Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create two users `owner01` and `attacker01`, log in as `owner01`  \n2. Make sure the `owner01` user have `Ultimate` subscription. You can use a free trail on GitLab.com  \n3. Create a `private` group `ultimate_group`  \n4. Create a `private` project in the group called `project01` (make sure to have create README checked)  \n5. Go to https://gitlab.com/groups/ultimate_group/-/group_members and invite `attacker01` as a `developer`  \n6. Go to https://gitlab.com/groups/ultimate_group/-/saml  \n7. Scroll down to configuration and check all checkboxes (Enable SAML, enforce SSO and enforce SSO for git) and add URL `https://example.com` and Certificate fingerprint `752c14ea195c369bac3c3b7896975ee9fd15eeb7` (the settings does not matter, we want it to fail on request)  \n8. Click save  \n9. Log out and log back in as `attacker01`  \n10. Go to https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens and generate a `personal access token`, take a note of the token  \n11. Create a new project called `attack_project`  \n12. Create a new file in the project called `.gitlab-ci.yml` and add (replace \u003cPERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN with the token)  \n```yml  \ndata:  \n  script:  git clone https://attacker01:\u003cPERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\u003e[@]gitlab.com/ultimate_group/project01.git ; ls ./project01  \n```  \n13. When the file is created a pipeline will run, check the logs for the pipeline job in the list at https://gitlab.com/attacker01/attack_project/-/jobs  \n14. You should see an error message telling you that the checkout failed as there exists no SSO session for the user\n\n`[Image redacted - a PAT was in the screenshot]`\n\n15. Now go back and edit the pipeline file to (do not change anything except the project path)  \n```yml  \ndata:  \n  script:  git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}[@]gitlab.com/ultimate_group/project01.git ; ls ./project01  \n```  \n16. Check the new job in the pipeline job list and you should see that the git clone succeeded and the files from the project are listed\n\n![clone2.jpg](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/4cfada07-e894-4ff5-b466-6ee84570ed8d/clone2.jpg)\n\n####  Impact\n\nA user that is restricted to access a project through Git actions due to SAML SSO enforcement can bypass this restriction and access the repository by requests using the CI job token. The user needs to have \"gitlab access\" to the project (the project is internal, or the user is added to the member list) but is blocked due to not using a SAML SSO login. Group owners might rely on SAML configurations and be relaxed with other access permissions as the SAML restrictions should block users. This is especially true for `internal` projects where the user can now access the repository through git.\n\n####  What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUsing CI job tokens as authentication will allow cloning a repository that have SAML SSO git access restriction\n\n####  What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nUsing CI job tokens should be checked against SAML SSO Sessions\n\n####  Output of checks\n\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n####  Impact\n\nA user that is restricted to access a project through Git actions due to SAML SSO enforcement can bypass this restriction and access the repository by requests using the CI job token.

automatically report.\n\n## How\n\nFollow the steps [documented here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/new_fe_guide/modules/widget_extensions.html#add-new-widgets).  \nNote the mention of the `--ee` flag.\n\n## When\n\nThere isn't a huge amount of urgency for this, but it would be nice to have sooner rather than later.\n\nEvents that aren't included in metrics are [reported as errors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368651) by our backend system.  \nTo avoid needing to [disable telemetry entirely](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/93330) for widgets that are not instrumented, we should just instrument them all.  \nNotably, these errors [are not causing problems](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01EMBKS5DW/p1658889380078289?thread_ts=1658888310.073319\u0026cid=C01EMBKS5DW) (internal slack link), but they are noisy.\n\n## Why\n\nOther than to increase the telemetry information we receive by default from widgets, _why_ this way is because this is how we track metrics with Redis.\n\n## Other info\n\nYou might find it useful to look at the 4 CE widgets that have already been addressed in the MRs below.  \nEach was done by following the steps in the documentation linked above.\n\n| Issue/MR | Widget | EE? |\n| -------- | ------ | --- |\n|

automatically report.\n\n## How\n\nFollow the steps [documented here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/new_fe_guide/modules/widget_extensions.html#add-new-widgets).  \nNote the mention of the `--ee` flag.\n\n## When\n\nThere isn't a huge amount of urgency for this, but it would be nice to have sooner rather than later.\n\nEvents that aren't included in metrics are [reported as errors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368651) by our backend system.  \nTo avoid needing to [disable telemetry entirely](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/93330) for widgets that are not instrumented, we should just instrument them all.  \nNotably, these errors [are not causing problems](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01EMBKS5DW/p1658889380078289?thread_ts=1658888310.073319\u0026cid=C01EMBKS5DW) (internal slack link), but they are noisy.\n\n## Why\n\nOther than to increase the telemetry information we receive by default from widgets, _why_ this way is because this is how we track metrics with Redis.\n\n## Other info\n\nYou might find it useful to look at the 4 CE widgets that have already been addressed in the MRs below.  \nEach was done by following the steps in the documentation linked above.\n\n| Issue/MR | Widget | EE? |\n| -------- | ------ | --- |\n|

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/security/vulnerabilities/32191285\n\nI presume that `marked`, being a markdown parser, receives and parses input from our users. I can't see us calling the methods in the description explicitly, but the PoC makes it look as though the attack is fairly simple. If we aren't vulnerable we can downgrade this.\n\n### Description:\n\nThe regular expression `block.def` and `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n* Severity: high\n* Confidence: unknown\n* Location: [yarn.lock](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/e79a78747e94bba5cac4d1c86f8c5ca2f6b14581/yarn.lock)\n\nA PoC from the GitHub Advisory:\n\n```js\nimport

file","description":"\u003c!-- This template is a great use for issues that are feature::additions or technical tasks for larger issues.--\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nConsidering that we are no longer using Starboard for [Operational Container Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/vulnerabilities.html), it no longer makes sense to use term `starboard` in the agent config file.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Use this section to explain the feature and how it will work. It can be helpful to add technical details, design proposals, and links to related epics or issues. --\u003e\n\n1. The term `container_scanning` will be added as an alternate option instead of using the term `starboard` in the definition for the agent config file.\n   1. Note: We we will continue to support `starboard` in the code through %16.0 as this will be a breaking change.\n1. Documentation will be updated to reflect this change.\n\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- [x] Update [agentcfg.proto](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/c33e770b7e33b926a73cfc8221f50a99b8c31496/pkg/agentcfg/agentcfg.proto) to add `container_scanning` similar to `starboard`\n- [x] Update [internal/module/starboard_vulnerability/agent/module.go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/c33e770b7e33b926a73cfc8221f50a99b8c31496/internal/module/starboard_vulnerability/agent/module.go) to get `container_scanning` from `agentcfg.AgentConfiguration` and if it's empty fallback to `starboard`\n- [-] For consistency, update the name of the directory from [internal/module/starboard_vulnerability](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/tree/master/internal/module/starboard_vulnerability) to `internal/module/container_scanning` and update the references\n- [x] ~documentation Update documentation to mention the `starboard` field will not be supported from

[x] Create an application setting to store the SR address https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/96918\n2. [x] Build suggested reviewer client class  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/93634\n- With a default time-out of 15 seconds\n- Using SR gRPC Ruby stub transform the Ruby request and response\n- Under `ee/lib/` (e.g. `suggested_reviewers_client.rb`) (see [`gitaly_client.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/gitaly_client/blob_service.rb))\n3. [ ] Add a service to fetch suggested reviewers with redis caching per MR id.\n4. [ ] Add a background sidekiq job to fetch and cache suggested reviewers for each MR\n5. [ ] Trigger the background services whenever an MR changes\n6. [x] A graphql endpoint with resolvers to fetch reviewers from the service. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/96771\n7. [ ] Build the UI into the merge request screen\n8. [ ] Add authentication to the SR calls\n9. [ ] Add TLS to secure transport\n\n\n\n\n##  Earlier Proposal\n\nTo allow us to build this client more iteratively, the following items propose the initial version of the client (`#E9967A`). We will attempt to add more robustness to this client as per [the implementation plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/review-recommender/recommender-service/-/issues/3#-implementation-plan).\n\n\n```plantuml\nskinparam shadowing false\nskinparam

[`gitaly_client.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/gitaly_client/blob_service.rb))\n  - Configure the default time-out (use GitLab default timeout for now, later could introduce an app config)\n  - Generate and include the SR gRPC Ruby stub (we will extract this to a [separate gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/review-recommender/recommender-bot-service/-/issues/23) in a later iteration)\n- Introduce a suggestion service under `ee/lib/suggested_reviewers_client/suggestion_service.rb` (see [`repository_service.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/gitaly_client/repository_service.rb))\n  - Delegate gRPC call to the client and perform some transformation on

We also have a test to ensure that [build.gradle.kts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/740aad6ddc75a861b78dd889795bd0a4c3b7ec70/qa/fixtures/java-gradle/kotlin-dsl/build.gradle.kts) files can be used with `gradle` as expected.\n\n#### Is this a bug in the GitLab Dependency Scanning analyzer (aka `gemnasium-maven`)?\n\nYes and no. The `unresolved dependencies` error is caused by a `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`) file which contains unresolved dependencies.\n\nThe issue that we're facing is that the \"official\" `gradle` method for outputting dependencies, aka the `gradle dependencies` task, is able to continue and produce meaningful output when an unresolved dependency is encountered, while the GitLab implementation, aka the `gemnasium-maven` analyzer, fails when an unresolved dependency is encountered.\n\nThis issue should hopefully be fixed by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337083+, but until this issue has been completed, you'll need to fix the `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`) file by adding the unresolved dependency. See [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368564#note_1034928096) for one of the ways we've managed to fix this issue.\n\n### Background\n\nTo understand what's going on, we need to discuss how `gemnasium-maven` works:\n\nOnce `gemnasium-maven` detects a supported build file, such as `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, it executes the `gradle` or `gradlew` command, and passes an [`--init-script` argument](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/blob/bebc810/builder/gradle/gradle.go#L80-80) which executes the `gemnasiumDumpDependencies` task of the [gemnasium-gradle-plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin) project.\n\nThe `gemnasiumDumpDependencies` task attempts to build the gradle project from the given `build.gradle` file, resolves dependencies, and outputs the project dependencies to a `gradle-dependencies.json` file, which is then parsed by `gemnasium-maven`.\n\nIf a dependency cannot be resolved while building the gradle project, [gemnasium-gradle-plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin) will report the familiar `unresolved dependencies` error and _does not produce a dependency graph_:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin.git \u0026\u0026 \\\n   cd gemnasium-gradle-plugin \u0026\u0026 \\\n   git checkout 42c5ff41c25fceb561480b379f1886034a09d303\n\n$ docker run -it --rm -e SECURE_LOG_LEVEL=debug \\\n   -v \"$PWD:/gemnasium-gradle-plugin-src\" \\\n   -w /gemnasium-gradle-plugin/src \\\n   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-maven:2.27.4 \\\n   bash -ic 'gradle -p /gemnasium-gradle-plugin-src --init-script /gemnasium-gradle-plugin-init.gradle gemnasiumDumpDependencies'\n\nWelcome to Gradle 6.7.1!\n\n\u003e Task :gemnasiumDumpDependencies FAILED\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':gemnasiumDumpDependencies'.\n\u003e Project has 2 unresolved dependencies: org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.5.10, org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.5.10\n```\n\nSince the `gemnasiumDumpDependencies` task relies on `gradle` to build the project, this error indicates an issue with the `build.gradle` file.\n\nWe can confirm the issue by running the `gradle dependencies` task directly, thereby removing `gemnasium-maven` and `gemnasium-gradle-plugin` from the equation:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-gradle-plugin.git \u0026\u0026 \\\n   cd gemnasium-gradle-plugin \u0026\u0026 \\\n   git checkout 42c5ff41c25fceb561480b379f1886034a09d303\n\n$ docker run -it --rm -e SECURE_LOG_LEVEL=debug \\\n   -v \"$PWD:/gemnasium-gradle-plugin-src\" \\\n   -w /gemnasium-gradle-plugin/src \\\n   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-maven:2.27.4 \\\n   bash -ic 'gradle -p /gemnasium-gradle-plugin-src dependencies'\n\nWelcome to Gradle 6.7.1!\n...\n\u003e Task :dependencies\n...\nfunctionalTestImplementationDependenciesMetadata\n+--- org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.5.10\n...\n+--- org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.5.10 FAILED\n+--- org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test-junit:1.5.10\n|    +--- org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.5.10 FAILED\n```\n\nAs can be seen from the above output, the `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test:1.5.10` dependency failed to resolve while executing the `gradle dependencies` task, however, the task still produced a dependency graph.\n\nThis is the main difference between the built-in `gradle dependencies` task and the `gemnasium-gradle-plugin gemnasiumDumpDependencies` task when encountering an unresolvable dependency:\n\n- the built-in `gradle dependencies` task continues and produces a dependency graph.\n- the `gemnasium-gradle-plugin gemnasiumDumpDependencies` task halts immediately and outputs an error message and does not produce a dependency graph.\n\nWe currently have an open issue to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337083+ which will allow `gemnasium-maven` to recover from `unresolved dependencies` errors and still produce a dependency graph.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe purpose of this issue is add details to the troubleshooting section of the [Dependency Scanning docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/b3639c7675b/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#L1118-1118) to explain how to fix this `unresolved dependencies` error.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\nAdd details to the troubleshooting section of the [Dependency Scanning docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/b3639c7675b/doc/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#L1118-1118) to explain how to fix this `unresolved dependencies` error:\n\n\u003e If you encounter the error message: `Project has x unresolved dependencies:` then this indicates a dependency resolution problem caused by your `gradle.build` or `gradle.build.kts` file. Currently, `gemnasium-maven` is unable to continue processing when an unresolved dependency is encountered, however, we have an [open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337083) to allow `gemnasium-maven` to recover from unresolved dependency errors and produce a dependency graph. Until this issue has been completed, you'll need to consult the [Gradle dependency resolution docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html) for details on how to fix your `gradle.build` file.\n\n/cc @gonzoyumo @fcatteau @sam.white @greg

A number of different problems were identified with the feature, e.g. an inconsistent state leading to jobs being dropped: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7223#note_977020553 , wrong handling of mirroring in case of the wrong license: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216783 . Some of those problems have already been addressed. This issue, is about one of the problems that hasn't been addressed yet, but was identified during investigations, i.e. slow SQL queries during scheduling.\n\nOne of the workers, called `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker`, is responsible for scheduling mirroring jobs. It gets the state of mirroring from Postgres, from a table called `project_mirror_data`. The state is pulled from Postgres using multiple queries (it's not a single query or a single transaction, more like hundreds of queries). In multiple incidents we've seen that:\n- it can take in the order of tens of seconds for individual queries to execute\n- queries are slow enough to be hitting statement timeout on Postgres: https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/88ca9490-08f9-11ed-8656-f5f2137823ba\n- it can take minutes for the worker to get the state from the database: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7420#note_1025123284\n\nAt the moment of writing, the entire pull mirroring feature is in a much healthier state, so the timings and cancellations are not as bad as they were during incidents. However, there are still cases when the statements are canceled. There are also cases of long db durations, here are executions of `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker` which spent more than 50s in querying the database: https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/3eabf890-08f9-11ed-8656-f5f2137823ba . If more users were to configure pull mirroring or we had again a backlog of jobs to process, these times would increase again.\n\n## Impact\n\u003c!--\n- Quantify the effect of the problem to help ensure that correct prioritization occurs.\n- Include costs to availability. The Incident Budget Explorer dashboard can help here.\n- Include the number of times alerts have fired owing to the problem, how much time was spent dealing with the problem, and how many people were involved.\n- Link to affected incidents, and cross-reference them as related issues.\n- Include screenshots of visualization from Grafana or Kibana.\n- Always include a permalink to the source of the screenshot so that others can investigate further.\n--\u003e\n\n- we observed up to 5 mins delay between subsequent executions of `UpdateAllMirrorsWorker` (this adds to the overall delay between project mirroring)\n- if the SQL timeouts reach a high enough frequency, the worker won't be able to update the list of projects to be mirrored\n- the impact is global (not limited to a specific user or a group)\n\n## Recommendation\n\u003c!--\nProvide a clear, unambiguous, self-contained solution to the problem.\n--\u003e\n\n- rethink the querying strategy (the way we get state from Postgres), perhaps using hundreds of queries is sub optimal or perhaps the opposite, maybe more queries which are lighter would bring down the overall time\n- SeqScan is used – Consider adding an index \u003chttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/understanding_explain_plans.html#optimising-queries%7CShow details\u003e\n- Query processes too much data to return a relatively small number of rows. – Reduce data cardinality as early as possible during the execution, using one or several of the following techniques: new indexes, partitioning, query rewriting, denormalization. See the visualization of the plan to understand which plan nodes are the main bottlenecks. \u003chttp://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/hw_performance/%7CShow details\u003e\n- Specialized index needed – The index(es) currently used does not serve quite well for the needs of this query (notice `Rows Removed by Filter: ...`, meaning that the index fetched many non-target rows). Consider adding more specialized index(es). \u003chttps://postgres.ai/#tip-index-inefficient-high-filtered%7CShow details\u003e\n\n\n\n\n## Extra details\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368019\n\n* Suggested in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92422#note_1026848136\n* Follow-up for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216783\n\n\n### Problem\n\n[We currently use a complex and slow query to select pull mirrors we need to update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/665360603e32d22f924932fa5bbe3871397dfe2b/ee/app/workers/update_all_mirrors_worker.rb#L135)\n\nMerge request https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92422 added deactivation feature for mirrors that we don't update due to license check.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIt should be possible to remove `check_mirror_plans_in_query?` branch from the query and improve the performance.\n\n#### Potential problems\n\nThe query without `check_mirror_plans_in_query?` is less restrictive and can select pull mirrors we haven't updated before. We need to evaluate the impact on customers.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-21T13:53:05.859Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T14:04:06.992Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T16:39:55.368Z","closed_by":{"id":1161495,"username":"igor.drozdov","name":"Igor
