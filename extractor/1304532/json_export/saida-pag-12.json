Move gitlab-production off [sustained use discounting](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts) and on to committed use discounting (this issue).\n\nSince committed use discounts (CUDs) offer significantly deeper discounting than sustained use discounts (SUDs), this issue is to investigate the possible savings and action plan for this move.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* Identify the gitlab-production systems and compute we could move to CUDs, even if they're currently benefitting from SUDs.\n* Estimate the additional discounting and possible savings. Evaluate whether or not it's worth pursuing based on the risk (we'd be committing to the spend).\n\n### Links/resources\n\n* [CloudPark.com](https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/google-cloud-committed-use/) on Google CUDs","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-17T21:26:21.994Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T20:23:52.749Z","closed_at":"2019-04-17T20:05:06.119Z","closed_by":{"id":895869,"username":"andrewn","name":"Andrew Newdigate","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/895869/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andrewn"},"labels":["Cloud Spend","Executing","Infrastructure","Savings-Estimate::$200k - $500k  / QTR","auto updated","moved 1"],"milestone":{"id":840628,"iid":13,"group_id":1112072,"title":"DS Team 2019 Week 15","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-05T23:03:08.211Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T22:57:03.216Z","due_date":"2019-04-20","start_date":"2019-04-07","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/13"},"assignees":[{"id":895869,"username":"andrewn","name":"Andrew Newdigate","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/895869/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andrewn"}],"author":{"id":1086520,"username":"jeremy-gl","name":"Jeremy Watson (ex-GitLab)","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1086520/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeremy-gl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":895869,"username":"andrewn","name":"Andrew Newdigate","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/895869/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andrewn"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6240","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6240","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6240/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6240/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6240","relative":"#6240","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#6240"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":18250633,"iid":6236,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Chef does not complete due to broken td-agent","description":"`td-agent` is not starting on the DR database servers (and possibly other servers as well).

(i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team member wasn't page-able, ...)\n\n## Timeline\n\n2019-02-13\n\n- 21:05 UTC - patroni04 fails to connect to consul\n- 21:05 UTC - Postgres restarts on the patroni04\n- 21:06 UTC - Increased Error Rates Alert (https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/incidents/PO854MA)\n- 21:11 UTC - Increased Error Rates Alert resolves\n- 21:48 UTC - Alert received `PostgreSQL_TooManyDeadTuples` on `ci_builds`\n- 22:28 UTC - alert received `PostgreSQL_TooManyDeadTuples` on `ci_job_artifacts`\n- 22:53 UTC - alert received `PostgreSQL_TooManyDeadTuples` on `ci_pipelines`\n\n2019-02-14\n\n- 01:33 UTC - alert received `PostgreSQL_TooManyDeadTuples` on `ci_stages`\n- (more similar alerts)\n- 10:24 UTC - noticed postgres restart has taken place at around 21.06pm UTC yesterday (spike in the memory graphs :trolleybus:) @abrandl\n- 10:45 UTC - killed all ongoing `VACUUM ANALYZE` processes for two tables @abrandl\n- 10:47 UTC - started `ANALYZE VERBOSE` on the full database, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/690#note_141280031 @abrandl\n- 11:25 UTC - `ANALYZE VERBOSE` finished, statistics are back @abrandl\n- 11:30 UTC - While our own investigation is going on, I asked OnGres to look as well (https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CBCRJDSBY/p1550143723055000) @abrandl\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n- Patroni demoted the primary postgres DB.\n- Because it couldn't connect to the DCS (Consul).\n- Because it got exceptions:\n  - `HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=8500): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/kv/service/pg-ha-cluster/?recurse=1`\n  - `2019-02-13_21:05:23 patroni-04-db-gprd patroni[2192]:  2019-02-13 21:05:23,548 ERROR: Error communicating with DCS`\n  - `2019-02-13 21:05:47,877 INFO: demoted self because DCS is not accessible and i was a leader`\n  - `2019-02-13 21:05:50,524 INFO: promoted self to leader by acquiring session lock`\n- Because patroni04 had network issues (maybe related to dmesg log showing TCP related kernel stack traces)\n\n## What went well\n\n- patroni failover worked very well within seconds\n- we got alerts for higher error rates and dead tuples\n- @yguo and @cshobe worked together to restore table stats\n- @abrandl noticed the demotion\n\n## What can be improved\n\n- alerting for patroni demotion events\n- missing table stats should lead to the conclusion that a db failover could have happened\n- db ANALYZE procedures in case of DB failover should be better known now or be automated (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5841)\n- monitoring kernel stack dumps might help to detect issues with networking\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n* [ ] Automatically run `ANALYZE` on failover (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5841)\n  - assignee: TBD\n  - due: TBD\n* [ ] Make sure we get notifications for Patroni restart/failover (even if the role does not change like here!)

In order to do that we need a Kubernetes cluster associated with this project.\n\nProbably this GKE cluster should live in our production GCP project but it could just as well live in a separate GCP project if that's preferable.\n\nDuring the setup and probably for regular maintenance and troubleshooting we will need to provide some level of access to the GKE cluster for members of the Configure team (at least @DylanGriffith and @tauriedavis) as dogfooding Auto DevOps is one of our long term objectives. Also we assume that the production team will not want to be fully responsible for keeping this system up and running as it's not production critical infrastructure.\n\n# How\n\n1. Decide which GCP project to use\n1.

We want to do this at first without actually making a connection to production. This will reduce the risk.  Ideally, we should be able to load the database up to a certain time, and then switch on replication to catch up the difference, rather than turning on replication and having it pull the entire database from production directly.\n\nCurrently the DR database is minimally configured by terraform and chef.

2019-02-01 HTTP502's","description":"## Summary\n\nA brief summary of what happened. Try to make it as executive-friendly as possible.\n\n* Service(s) affected: **GitLab.com**\n* Team attribution: ~\"team:infrastructure\"\n* Minutes downtime or degradation: **3 hours 50 minutes**\n\nAs part of a maintenance task https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/664, a script was running to slowly move older larger repos to a different file server.  Jobs that were being scheduled were failing due to timeouts and then retrying.  This led to excessive work being scheduled on the file server that was targeted at that time for maintenance and slowly ramped up the IO load on that file server.  This high IO translated into Gitaly timeout for requests going to it, leading to many HTTP502's for customers.\n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- What was the impact of the incident? **slow performance and HTTP 502 responses from GitLab**\n- Who was impacted by this incident? **Everyone**\n\nInclude any additional metrics that are of relevance.\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/674\n\n![image](/uploads/ea3fcf458e7ea632ff7a1bf985bd5749/image.png)\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/RZmbBr7mk/gitlab-triage?orgId=1\u0026from=1549028551843\u0026to=1549037954496\n\n![image](/uploads/9b83d3d0a41ba69125455e107df650b1/image.png)\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/000000204/gitaly-metrics-per-host?orgId=1\u0026var-fqdn=file-23-stor-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\u0026var-job=gitaly\u0026from=1549028637790\u0026to=1549050237790\n\nAnother fun set of charts here: https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/WOtyonOiz/general-triage-service?orgId=1\u0026var-prometheus_ds=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-type=gitaly\u0026var-sigma=2\u0026var-component_availability=All\u0026var-component_ops=All\u0026var-component_apdex=All\u0026var-component_errors=All\u0026from=1549026945355\u0026to=1549041345355\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\n- How was the incident detected? **Customer reports** and our beta monitoring\n\n- Did alarming work as expected? **Not entirely**\n\nWhile we did get alerts for high rates of 500's, this alerting didn't come through until it was too late and the root cause was able to strengthen it's leverage before anything was done.  We did not receive any pages.\n\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection? **+1 Hour**\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?  **+2 Hours**\n\n## Timeline\n\n2019-02-01\n\n- 12:53 UTC - maintenance on fileserver 23 had begun - command executed: `gitlab-rails runner /tmp/storage_rebalance.rb --current-file-server nfs-file23 --target-file-server nfs-file27 --move-amount 2560 --dry-run false --wait 300 | tee nfs-file23.log`\n- 15:02 UTC - first page regarding high 5xx counts - https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C12RCNXK5/p1549033324163300\n- 15:03 UTC - first alert regarding Gitaly Error counts on fileserver 23 - https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C12RCNXK5/p1549033383163500\n- 15:30 UTC - oncall engineer reaches out to the engineer performing the maintenance\n- 15:31 UTC - maintenance operation was halted to proceed further\n- 15:34 UTC - estimated 31 projects were in-flight during maintenance, any process related to this maintenance work was `renice`'d to lower the IO impact on the file server\n- 15:38 UTC - fileserver 23 started to show signs of recovery as `git` processes were completing\n- 15:58 UTC - fileserver 23 reached okay SLO since degradation\n- 16:41 UTC - fileserver 23 remained above the SLO\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nA seemingly routine maintenance item, which had worked for the past entire week without incident resulted in a failure.  A script that would routinely query for projects to be moved was chugging along without taking into account the amount of active jobs nor failures and retries of existing jobs.  These jobs were responsible for telling a file server to move data from one server to another.  Some jobs took a long time and they were marked as a failure due to timeout, despite the underlying mechanisms still running on the file server.  When the job was retried, it spun up another process on that file server.  One project that should have been moved, would have resulted in 3 total operations on the same project.  During the time in which maintenance stopped, it was discovered that 31 projects were scheduled to move off of this file server, and all of them were continuing to process data on the repository before completing the move.\n\nThis process of moving data invokes the `git upload-pack` command which is very IO intensive.  For large repositories this can take awhile.  The script created for this maintenance was built only to schedule the work and allow sidekiq to schedule the work.  It is not visible to the maintenance script nor the operator to the extent of progression or failure rate occurring specifically due to these repo migrations.\n\n## What went well\n\n* The maintenance operator was able to quickly gather a list of processes tied to project moves and `renice` them to help the server along.\n  * We chose not to kill any running processes in order to prevent data corruption\n* The script was designed to prevent overflowing the queue and needing to do manual intervention of future work that would've been queued.\n\n## Questions\n* Is there a potential network bottleneck?\n* Can we develop a better understanding of how our Gitaly SLO's impact overall webserver performance?\n\n## What can be improved\n\n* No one was notified.  This situation was not treated as an incident when it should have been.  Our support team and our users were lacking any status information.\n* SRE's need a better understanding of the impact for project migrations, this was a new failure scenario that wasn't run into previously\n* Documentation for how project moves works doesn't discuss what mechanisms are utilized to perform moves, learning that `git upload-pack` was running multiple times on the file servers was new information\n* Visibility into this process overall is highly limited\n  * This encompasses logging\n  * Viewing sidekiq metrics\n* We need to discuss better ways of garnering the attention of the correct parties\n  * https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1549034830974100\n  * https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1549042978985800 \n  * If members think there might be an incident, we need to ensure we mark the correct urgency on potential issues.\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n- Improvements should be made to the script that was performing these project repo migrations - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6157\n- Better handling of failure scenarios inside of GitLab - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9563\n- Improve this processes visibility in GitLab - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9534\n- Improve Gitaly process monitoring/niceness - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9606\n- Alert Improvements - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6158\n- Communication Improvements - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6160\n\n## Guidelines\n\n*

with inconsistent move sizes","description":"In this issue, we are moving data from nfs-file21 over to nfs-file25.  Two projects have data size inconsistencies between the two servers.  For both repos (just the data not the wiki's), the size on disk is larger on the location we are migrating too.  I'm curious if we can figure out potential corrupted data, and how to potentially coalesce anything if necessary.  At this moment in time, the database still points the storage of these repos to the old server `nfs-file21`.  These repos are currently marked as read only.  The goal for this issue, would be to remove what was moved to nfs-file25 (if safe), and mark the repositories as writable again.\n\n## Projects in question:\n* [ ] 9413811\n* [ ] 9495429\n\n##
