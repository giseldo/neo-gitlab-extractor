GCP Project for GitLab QA GKE Clusters (and maybe more for teams)","description":"We have multiple uses for creating Kubernetes clusters in GKE right now. Most people in the company (including our automated tests) are using the `gitlab-internal` project in GCP for doing this and as the company grows we are reaching our GCP limits quite regularly (most challenging to resolve is the IP range limit for multiple clusters  https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CB07X8AQ3/p1543741063017000?thread_ts=1543741035.016900\u0026cid=CB07X8AQ3)\n\nWe (the Configure team and others) use this for testing GitLab's Kubernetes integration locally and on gitlab.com.\n\nWe also create these clusters during automated QA tests. This regularly results in failures due to exhausted resources (eg. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/nightly/issues/50 ) and this can break in Master and requires us to ask around for people to clean up after themselves (eg. https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1547228126465300 ) which is all a manual process.\n\nThere may be other ways to solve these quota (or IP range exhaustion) problems. Perhaps increasing GCP quotas will help but from what I understand we may need to reconfigure something in GCP to allow more IP addresses to fit in the range (see https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/configure/issues/4#note_127820216) .\n\nAnother challenge with having everyone in the company using the same GCP instance is that it's difficult to encourage good habits about cleaning things up since not everybody realises that not cleaning things up could actually be creating blockers for other teams or even breaking our master build. If we had separate projects for QA then at least nobody could break the build but still the Configure team might end up blocked if we run out on `gitlab-internal`. Configure team relies heavily on this to do their work so quite possibly they will need their own GCP project as well.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-11T18:01:45.650Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T10:02:07.081Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T05:24:30.329Z","closed_by":{"id":478289,"username":"northrup","name":"John Northrup","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f076b1aa65652a2852e897baf0a65ba0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/northrup"},"labels":["auto updated","oncall"],"milestone":{"id":753074,"iid":61,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Completed 2019-01-26","description":"On call work milestone - tracking issues worked by oncall.\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-07T21:41:02.373Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T16:29:51.114Z","due_date":"2019-01-26","start_date":"2019-01-13","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":120073,"username":"DylanGriffith","name":"Dylan Griffith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/120073/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/DylanGriffith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":18,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5936","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5936","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5936/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5936/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5936","relative":"#5936","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5936"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17268993,"iid":5927,"project_id":1304532,"title":"version goes down like every weekend","description":"For the past couple of weekends, version.gitlab.com goes offline for a bit.

team","description":"## Objective\nThe objective of this issue is to derive a discussion around the programming/scripting languages that we accept (or would want to accept) for usage within our team. This came up from a feedback on a recent automation work which was done in Python and a proposal was suggested to do everything in Ruby going forward. Hence, I wanted to create this issue and gather more feedback to understand the reasoning behind this and whether 'Ruby/Go-only' is ultimately where we, as a team, go. \n\n## Datapoints \nStarting with the most obvious:\n- Our product is a Ruby-on-Rails product [1], [2] \n- The SRE role job description does list \"Ruby and/or Go\" under a \"May be a fit\" [3]\n- We already have ruby/go scripts that help with our infrastructure work\n\n## Discussion \nIs the answer to this inquiry is as simple as: \"We should just go with Ruby/Go in all of our infrastructure related work\"? While the above data points are already present, I know we do use bash scripts though it is not specifically called out. It is possible that it is an inherent requirement that we all should know and should be able to use. However, going further than this, what do we think about adopting/using other languages such as Python or even Java (not as a replacement of Ruby/Go but as an addition as long as they get our jobs done)?\n\nWe might want to avoid getting into too much in-depth discussion on comparing one language to another (underlying implementation, learning-curve, syntax, performance, community support and adoption, functionalities and features...etc) but I think it might be better if we focus on what do we as a team want and why one language is a better choice over another based on our experience and infrastructure need. \n\nSome indicators on why I think we could possibly add Python to our list:\n- We are on GCP and Google Cloud has an officially supported, Python library (just like Ruby and Go) [4]\n- Kubernetes is one of the items on our radar and it has an officially supported Python library similar to Go. But, Ruby is listed on the community supported library. [5]\n- If we end up using Ansible, it is also written in Python. \n- Within GCP, if we want to write a Google Cloud Function - it currently only supports Node.JS and Python. \n\nNote, the above don't talk about one language's performance, syntax, configuration, implementation, features...etc. \n\nI am not sure what the degree of Ruby/Go experience is for the rest of the team. But as for transparency, my personal experience with Ruby/Go is much less than Python/Java. Therefore, a decision to stick with the former group of languages would mean I would have to ramp up on them as well. However, I will be happy to do so if we do end up sticking to Ruby/Go only. :) \n\n@gitlab\\-com/gl\\-infra \n\n## References\n[1] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce\n[2] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee\n[3] https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/site-reliability-engineer/ \n[4] https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-11T03:15:53.131Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T22:34:43.215Z","closed_at":"2019-01-14T01:00:37.659Z","closed_by":{"id":2601632,"username":"aamarsanaa","name":"Amarbayar Amarsanaa","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2601632/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aamarsanaa"},"labels":["Discussion"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":2601632,"username":"aamarsanaa","name":"Amarbayar Amarsanaa","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2601632/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aamarsanaa"}],"author":{"id":2601632,"username":"aamarsanaa","name":"Amarbayar Amarsanaa","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2601632/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aamarsanaa"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2601632,"username":"aamarsanaa","name":"Amarbayar Amarsanaa","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2601632/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aamarsanaa"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-01-15","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5916","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5916","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5916/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5916/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5916","relative":"#5916","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5916"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17246637,"iid":5908,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Enable fast_destroy_uploads flag in production","description":"There is a new feature - async deletion of uploads (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/20977), this is behind feature flag and disabled. To make sure this feature works properly, I'd like to do following steps on production:\n\n* run `rake gitlab:cleanup:remote_upload_files` on prod to get current number of orphaned files\n* enable `fast_destroy_uploads` feature and wait for 1-2 days\n* run `rake gitlab:cleanup:remote_upload_files` and compare number of orphaned files - if there is significant increase of orhpaned files, it might be sign that uploads deletion doesn't work as expected\n\nRunning this rake task should not cause dramatic IO load on prod server (as most of checking should be done in object store) and it's expected to run probably few hours - https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1547136320445300\n\nI set due date to 21st because based on slack discussion that week would be preferred to do this

kernel update requires successful chef run","description":"Successful chef run requires successful bootstrap kernel update.\n\nWhen bootstrapping a new system, we upgrade the kernel to our desired version.\n\nDuring the bootstrap process, before the kernel upgrade, we do a chef run.\n\nIf this chef run fails for any reason (including missing vault keys), the kernel update fails - then the system reboots, leaving the system locked in an unbootable state.\n\nThis makes it difficult to determine why the chef run failed. Fixing the chef problem will not cause it to recover, since it will never try again.  The machine needs to be destroyed and re-created.\n\nThe kernel upgrade should not depend on the success of the chef run. It should be robust enough to succeed even if chef does not. It should end up powered on and repeatedly re-trying the chef run. That will leave it in a state where fixing the chef or credential problem will result in the next chef attempt succeeding.\n\nHere are the relevant lines from the bootstrap log:\n\n```\nFeb 12

mechanism. In the Geo Group Conversation this morning, @sytses had some [good points](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3789#note_129839448) about Etcd starting to look like the industry standard. Since we are moving towards being cloud native eventually, we will eventually be using Etcd as part of Kubernetes, and at that point we will have two solutions to support.\n\nConsul is easier to use, and it is what we are currently using, but surely there is some value in supporting a single solution rather than two.\n\nThe Geo team is currently researching this issue (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8932). The @gitlab\\-com/gl\\-infra  team should also look into it before work starts, and either document why Consul will be the better solution long term, or lay out a path to convert existing consul use to etcd.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-08T16:42:48.201Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T18:42:20.337Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T20:03:19.410Z","closed_by":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"labels":["Discussion","Geo","OKR","auto updated"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"}],"author":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5894","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5894","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5894/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5894/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5894","relative":"#5894","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5894"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17174259,"iid":5892,"project_id":1304532,"title":"ChatOps SQL explain unable to connect to pgbouncer","description":"The ChatOps SQL explain does not work at the moment: https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1546962452337200\n\nThe error is:\n\n```\n/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.4.0/gems/pg-1.1.3/lib/pg.rb:56:in `initialize': ERROR:  pgbouncer cannot connect to server (PG::ConnectionBad)\n```\n\nThis can be reproduced with any `/chatops run explain SELECT...` query.\n\nAs pointed out on Slack, the [CI variables](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/chatops/settings/ci_cd) control which host to connect to.

This machine should not be provisioned manually as it would be second class from the beginning since all our linux environment is already automated. We can use a mixture of terraform and chef to provision and configure the machine.\n\nAs pointed out in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/3757#note_129070759 we need at least Windows

up DB replica for analytics pulls into EDW","description":"Organization:\n1. In this issue, we want to setup access to the archive replica and configure it such that it can be used from the ELT loads\n1. In a related issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5970, we are going to provide network-level access to said replica for the ELT runner jobs (with appropriate firewall rules).\n\nDiscussion summary:\n1. The ELT load will only need read-only permissions (hence a replica is fine).\n1. No strict SLA guarantees regarding uptime/availability/performance.\n1. Queries from the ELT load are expected to finish within 5 minutes. Statement timeouts will be enforced accordingly.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n\nOur current method for getting updated production data into our warehouse is as follows:\n\n* Update pseudonymizer config if possible https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/config/pseudonymizer.yml\n* Ping someone on production team to run the pseudonymizer (usually Stan)\n  * Hope that nothing fails or bombs out writing CSVs to GCS\n* Import generated CSVs from object storage into Snowflake\n\nThis presents a number of challenges, not the least of which is precious time from a member of the production team every time we want updated data. \n\nReading through https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/database/disaster_recovery.html and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd it seems like we should be able to set up an isolated replica that is updated on a regular basis with production data. (We do this regularly for version, customer, and license dbs https://gitlab.com/gitlab-restore/version.gitlab.com#vpc-setup) We don't need up to the minute updates, delays of 1-2 weeks is fine.\n\nIf we follow the same model where only our project's runner is whitelisted for access I think it'll simplify the security footprint and risk. We'd still have an explicit list of fields we'd be pulling that security would approve for updates and increased data pulls.\n\nMy time request is that something be stood up by the end of January. We've got some OKRs related to modeling of the dotcom data. \n\n@stanhu does this seem reasonable? I know it'd save you some time. \n\n@dawsmith thoughts on this? Is this something @yguo could setup?\n\n@jeremy @tszuromi just FYI - I'm trying to close the time between updates for production data. \n\ncc @tlapiana","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-01T15:43:59.406Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T12:50:25.508Z","closed_at":"2019-03-01T11:54:55.528Z","closed_by":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1562869/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"labels":["Database [pl]"],"milestone":{"id":799299,"iid":77,"project_id":1304532,"title":"JF Team 2019 Week 9","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-23T07:32:47.253Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T12:32:29.343Z","due_date":"2019-03-07","start_date":"2019-02-25","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1562869/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"}],"author":{"id":1942272,"username":"tayloramurphy","name":"Taylor A Murphy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1942272/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tayloramurphy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas Brandl","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1562869/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/abrandl"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5847","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5847","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5847/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5847/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5847","relative":"#5847","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5847"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17001284,"iid":5841,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Investigate solutions to vacuuming our database prior to failover","description":"During a recent failover https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/637, patroni-04 was elected leader.

However, with the current setup we can't utilize the pausing feature. Consider this scenario:\n\n1. `patroni-01` is a master, we want to failover to `patroni-02`\n1. We pause pgbouncer on `patroni-01`, existing client connections are completed and closed\n1. Clients are trying to establish new connections, they are still forwarded to `patroni-01` by the ILB but pgbouncer isn't accepting any yet\n1. We do a failover to `patroni-02`\n1. We resume (un-pause) pgbouncer on `patroni-01`\n1. Now `patroni-01` has connections that are trying to execute read/write queries, they will fail\n\nWe need to pause connections at the level of the ILB before they are forwarded to a master, but this doesn't seem possible. I tried marking all of Patroni ILB backends as unhealthy to see if new connections will fail immediately or will wait for a backend to become healthy, but the ILB forwarded the connection to one of the replicas! (even when its backend is marked as unhealthy)\n\nSo I think we may need to have a dedicated pgbouncer node in front of the ILB, so we can control the connection flow at a higher level. pgbouncer on such node will be configured with the ILB FQDN, so we don't run into all the issues of using Consul watchers to update the databases configuration. We can go one step further and drop the ILB altogether in favor of using Consul DNS record for the master node (assuming https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/633 has made it to production)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-28T21:11:59.389Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T13:19:13.387Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T13:19:13.354Z","closed_by":{"id":506061,"username":"ahmadsherif","name":"Ahmad Sherif","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6d0ec4213b91601956c9f801cbfe9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmadsherif"},"labels":["Database","auto updated","corrective action","unscheduled"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":506061,"username":"ahmadsherif","name":"Ahmad Sherif","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6d0ec4213b91601956c9f801cbfe9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmadsherif"}],"author":{"id":506061,"username":"ahmadsherif","name":"Ahmad Sherif","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6d0ec4213b91601956c9f801cbfe9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmadsherif"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":506061,"username":"ahmadsherif","name":"Ahmad Sherif","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6d0ec4213b91601956c9f801cbfe9b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahmadsherif"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5833","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5833","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5833/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5833/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5833","relative":"#5833","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5833"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":16957200,"iid":5832,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Large file in generic-sv-with-group terraform module","description":"There is a 42M file in the [generic-sv-with-group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/terraform-modules/google/generic-sv-with-group) terraform module at:\n\n`.terraform/plugins/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-google_v1.18.0_x4`\n\nOn a fast connection, it doesn't make much difference - but with the slow internet provider problems that I have been having, it's been preventing me from running `tf-init`.

Try to make it as executive-friendly as possible.\n\n1. Service(s) affected : Gitaly Storage Nodes\n2. Team attribution : Infrastructure\n3. Minutes downtime or degradation : 35 Minutes \n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- What was the impact of the incident? All customer and internal requests to Git data nodes were unable to be serviced for 34 minutes.\n- Who was impacted by this incident? External Customers, CI jobs\n- How did the incident impact customers? See impact above\n- How many attempts were made to access the impacted service/feature? \n- How many customers were affected? All\n- How many customers tried to access the impacted service/feature?\n\nInclude any additional metrics that are of relevance.\n\nProvide any relevant graphs that could help understand the impact of the incident and its dynamics.\n\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- How was the incident detected? PagerDuty/Slack Alerts\n- Did alarming work as expected? Yes\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection? Approximately 10 minutes\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation? 30 minutes\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident? (i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team memeber wasn't page-able, ...)\nYes - terraform module repos that were only on .com delayed us in running terraform to stand the compute node back up until a local copy was used.\n\n## Timeline\n\nOn the production issue.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nWhile working on our Disaster Recovery project and region, an SRE on our team was unable to use Terraform to properly remove some nodes in the the DR project and region.  They chose to go to the GCP console to perform the deletes to get the Terraform state back to good.  While doing this, they searched for some nodes and per the illustration below had their project switched from gitlab-dr to gitlab-production.  It was not clear that the project switch had been made and they proceeded to remove the gitaly compute instances (file-[1-24]) in the gitlab-production project.  At that point, monitoring started to alert us to the problem and the team started to restore the deleted compute nodes.\n\n### Illustration\n\nWhen attempting to search for something in the GCP search bar which has a partial match, one would expect that pressing enter here would execute a search for a partial IP address, which in this case returns no results.\n\n![Search](/uploads/e2f6e884da37a81f47cd38613abfffba/Search.png)\n\nPressing enter results in this:\n\n![Changed](/uploads/48988c5767305f64a109f595f342a560/Changed.png)\n\nWhich appears to have searched and found nothing.  However, it did not search - the first line in the dropdown above was highlighted - so the project changed. At this point, going and deleting the DR file nodes resulted in the gitlab-production nodes being deleted rather than the gitlab-dr nodes.\n\n## What went well\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Identify the things that worked well or as expected.\n- Any additional call-outs for what went particularly well.\n\n1.  Quickness of team to jump on a zoom and start to mitigate the issue.\n1.  We were able to restore the affected infrastructure with no data loss\n\n## What can be improved\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Using the root cause analysis, explain what can be improved to prevent this from happening again.\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the detection or time to detection?\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the response or time to response?\n- Is there an existing issue that would have either prevented this incident or reduced the impact?\n- Did we have any indication or beforehand knowledge that this incident might take place?\n\n1. Look at different node names for disaster recovery compute and storage node names vs production. \n2. Mirror all Terraform repos (environments and modules) on ops.gitlab.net to prevent issues with access when GitLab.com is down.\n3. Look at further enhancing procedures for any deletes in production requiring two sets of eyes and ways to prevent needing to do any interaction with the cloud console.  Further automation to ask and double check before performing the delete.\n\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5815 : Add deletion protection for gitaly servers\n2. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5816 : Move terraform modules to the ops instance\n3. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5868 : Start practicing incident response\n4. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5867 : Create list of incident response scenarios\n5. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5869 : Setup Atlantis for Terraform deployments on ops instance\n6. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5945 : Change to TF process to prevent conflicts that sent us to Cloud console\n\n## Guidelines\n\n* [Blameless RCA Guideline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/infrastructure/#rca)\n* [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-21T22:23:06.460Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T12:24:28.269Z","closed_at":"2019-02-05T23:43:08.877Z","closed_by":{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"},"labels":["IncidentReview","auto updated","moved 1","severity::1"],"milestone":{"id":753073,"iid":60,"project_id":1304532,"title":"DS team 2019 Week 5","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-07T21:39:55.723Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T14:16:08.052Z","due_date":"2019-02-10","start_date":"2019-01-28","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/milestones/60"},"assignees":[{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"}],"author":{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5813","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5813","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5813/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5813/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5813","relative":"#5813","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5813"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":16855222,"iid":5812,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Put packages.gitlab.com behind a CDN","description":"Discussed using fastly here - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/4452#note_88966038\n\nBut maybe we should consider using cloudfront for now?

to perform OS patching on all Gitter instances to establish timing and validate the steps listed in production#620.\n\n## Patch process\nThe patch process should at least be scripted, or possibly implemented via Ansible. The broad strokes will require running `apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get upgrade`. On at least one instance, preferably one instance of each service/group, we will also need to script and validate the rollback process before proceeding to production. Finally, we need to consider service impact when orchestrating the change, by draining connections and detaching instances from load-balancer(s) wherever possible.\n\n/cc @gitlab\\-com/gl\\-infra @MadLittleMods","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-18T20:11:21.694Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T19:24:23.856Z","closed_at":"2018-12-26T19:10:24.640Z","closed_by":{"id":693144,"username":"craig","name":"Craig Barrett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c8dfa1ca41754b9409068e5e42080cd2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craig"},"labels":["Gitter","change","group::gitter","staging","toil","unscheduled"],"milestone":{"id":713047,"iid":57,"project_id":1304532,"title":"2018-12-30 Completed","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-11-17T17:50:24.811Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T14:36:41.786Z","due_date":"2018-12-29","start_date":"2018-12-16","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/milestones/57"},"assignees":[{"id":693144,"username":"craig","name":"Craig Barrett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c8dfa1ca41754b9409068e5e42080cd2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craig"}],"author":{"id":693144,"username":"craig","name":"Craig Barrett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c8dfa1ca41754b9409068e5e42080cd2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craig"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":693144,"username":"craig","name":"Craig Barrett","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c8dfa1ca41754b9409068e5e42080cd2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craig"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5786","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5786","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5786/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5786/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5786","relative":"#5786","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5786"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":74585934,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":16772426,"iid":5785,"project_id":1304532,"title":"RCA: Pipelines slow \u0026 queued jobs","description":"## Summary\r\n\r\nMultiple users [reported](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1545154906806500) slowness in launching pipeline jobs on private runners.\r\n\r\nTiming correlated with spikes in sidekiq queues\r\n![sidekiq stats](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/render/d-solo/000000159/ci?refresh=5m\u0026orgId=1\u0026var-runner_type=All\u0026var-runner_managers=All\u0026var-cache_server=All\u0026var-gl_monitor_fqdn=patroni-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\u0026var-has_minutes=yes\u0026var-hanging_droplets_cleaner=All\u0026var-droplet_zero_machines_cleaner=All\u0026var-runner_job_failure_reason=All\u0026var-gitlab_env=gprd\u0026var-jobs_running_for_project=0\u0026panelId=85\u0026from=1545143637349\u0026to=1545158573520\u0026width=1000\u0026height=500\u0026tz=America%2FLos_Angeles)\r\n\r\nWhich also correlated with patch deployments to `cny` and later to `gprd` (yellow annotations)\r\n![sidekiq queues with deployments](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/render/d-solo/RZmbBr7mk/gitlab-triage?refresh=30s\u0026orgId=1\u0026from=1545137784683\u0026to=1545159384683\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-prometheus=prometheus-01-inf-gprd\u0026var-prometheus_app=prometheus-app-01-inf-gprd\u0026var-backend=All\u0026var-type=All\u0026var-stage=main\u0026panelId=5\u0026width=1000\u0026height=500\u0026tz=America%2FLos_Angeles)\r\n\r\nService(s) affected : ~\"Service:CI Runners\" ~\"Service:Sidekiq\"  \r\nTeam attribution :  \r\nMinutes downtime or degradation : TBD  \r\n\r\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\r\n\r\nStart with the following:\r\n\r\n- What was the impact of the incident? (i.e. service outage, sub-service brown-out, exposure of sensitive data, ...)\r\n- Who was impacted by this incident? (i.e. external customers, internal customers, specific teams, ...)\r\n- How did the incident impact customers? (i.e. preventing them from doing X, incorrect display of Y, ...)\r\n- How many attempts were made to access the impacted service/feature?\r\n- How many customers were affected?\r\n- How many customers tried to access the impacted service/feature?\r\n\r\nInclude any additional metrics that are of relevance.\r\n\r\nProvide any relevant graphs that could help understand the impact of the incident and its dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detection \u0026 Response\r\n\r\nStart with the following:\r\n\r\n- How was the incident detected?\r\n- Did alarming work as expected?\r\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection?\r\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?\r\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident? (i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team memeber wasn't page-able, ...)\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n2018-12-18\r\n\r\n- 15:23 UTC - @jlenny [reported issues](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CB7P5CJS1/p1545146610059200) with shared runners [in slack](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1545147179792500)\r\n- 15:36 UTC - user reported [very slow slack notifications/emails and stalled pipelines](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/110463)\r\n- 15:46 UTC - user reported [hung pipelines and idle runners](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/110464)\r\n- 16:54 UTC - user reported [latency in pipeline jobs](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/110472)\r\n- 17:41 UTC - slowness [reported](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C101F3796/p1545154906806500) to production team via slack\r\n\r\n## Root Cause Analysis\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this document is to understand the reasons that caused an incident, and to create mechanisms to prevent it from recurring in the future. A root cause can **never be a person**, the way of writing has to refer to the system and the context rather than the specific actors.\r\n\r\nFollow the \"**5 whys**\" in a **blameless** manner as the core of the root-cause analysis.\r\n\r\nFor this it is necessary to start with the incident, and question why it happened. Keep iterating asking \"why?\" 5 times. While it's not a hard rule that it has to be 5 times, it helps to keep questions get deeper in finding the actual root cause. \r\n\r\nKeep in min that from one \"why?\" there may come more than one answer, consider following the different branches.\r\n\r\n###Example of the usage of \"5 whys\"\r\nThe vehicle will not start. (the problem)\r\n\r\n1. Why? - The battery is dead. \r\n2. Why? - The alternator is not functioning.\r\n3. Why? - The alternator belt has broken.\r\n4. Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. \r\n5. Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)\r\n\r\n## What went well\r\n\r\nStart with the following:\r\n\r\n- Identify the things that worked well or as expected.\r\n- Any additional call-outs for what went particularly well.\r\n\r\n## What can be improved\r\n\r\nStart with the following:\r\n\r\n- Using the root cause analysis, explain what can be improved to prevent this from happening again.\r\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the detection or time to detection?\r\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the response or time to response?\r\n- Is there an existing issue that would have either prevented this incident or reduced the impact?\r\n- Did we have any indication or beforehand knowledge that this incident might take place?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Corrective actions\r\n\r\n- List issues that have been created as corrective actions from this incident.\r\n- For each issue, include the following:\r\n    - \u003cBare Issue link\u003e - Issue labeled as ~\"corrective action\".\r\n    - Include an estimated date of completion of the corrective action.\r\n    - Incldue the named individual who owns the delivery of the corrective action.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n\r\n* [Blameless RCA Guideline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/infrastructure/#rca)\r\n* [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)\r\n\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-18T19:54:16.807Z","updated_at":"2019-12-26T15:46:48.799Z","closed_at":"2019-01-09T21:56:39.927Z","closed_by":{"id":693144,"username":"craig","name":"Craig
