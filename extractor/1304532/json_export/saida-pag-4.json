redis config discrepancy for redis-cache between gstg and gprd","description":"Apart from credentials, the only discrepancy between the production and staging config for redis-cache nodes is the disk persistence options.  The redis-cache nodes in the staging environment enabled periodically writing an RDB dump, whereas production does not.  Since this dataset is meant to be ephemeral and gets persisted to disk anyway on clean shutdown, this may be a reasonable setting.  We can re-enable it later if we decide it's too expensive to repopulate this cache from empty, but anecdotally several people have mentioned that they think it's tolerable.  For now, let's just get the staging config to match production.\n\nFor reference, here's the discrepancy we're going to resolve:\n\n```shell\nmsmiley@saoirse:~$ ssh

weeks of successful testing (see `Daily staging restore using WAL-G, from WAL-G staging archive` in https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/pipeline_schedules), it is time to start testing on a production replica.\n\n1. [x] Decide how replica will be chosen and how it will be configured using Chef (note that patroni-01 is the master in gprd right now). Such replica is to be marked as unavailable for failover.\n1. [x] In addition to WAL-E, install WAL-G 0.2.14 to all Postgres instances (how it can be done: https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-restore/postgres-gprd/blob/master/bootstrap.sh#L84). It is okay to have both WAL-E and WAL-G installed.\n1. [x] Configure WAL-G. Use some new GCS bucket, different from the existing ones.\n1. [ ] on the chosen replica in `gprd`, put WAL-G's `wal-push` to `archive_command`, and set `archive_mode` to `'always'`.\n1. [ ] Ensure that wal-push log does not have errors, but shows successful WAL-pushing and the new GCS bucket/folder is being filled with WALs.\n1. [ ] Configure daily `backup-push` on the same replica (a cronjob similar to WAL-E's `backup-push` cronjob on the master), to have full backups daily.\n\nAdditional TODOs:\n\n- [ ]

Other Gitaly shards were not affected.\n\nThe CPU saturation was triggered by many clients concurrently running `git fetch` or `git clone` on a repo that has a large graph of commit objects to traverse.  To generate the inventory of objects that the client needs, Gitaly runs `git pack-objects`, which for this repo requires significant CPU time and memory.  Enough of these helper processes were running that the host starved for CPU time, resulting in the observed increased latency and error rate (timeouts) from this particular Gitaly shard.\n\nFor reference, this incident ties back to other similar regressions on this particular Gitaly shard starting on 2020-03-05.  Each regression event caused roughly 10-25 minutes of degraded performance on 1 of the 52 Gitaly shards (`file-45`).  Now that we understand the pathology, we can link it back to the following regression events:\n- 2020-03-16: 3 events = 65 minutes\n- 2020-03-13: 1 event = 20 minutes\n- 2020-03-12: 3 events = 60 minutes\n- 2020-03-09: 1 event, 10 minutes\n- 2020-03-05: 2 events, 40 minutes\n\n\n### Mitigations\n\nThe owner of the repo whose distributed builds triggered this regression has kindly offered to adjust their build to reduce its impact.  Reusing fresher git-clones on the build servers may help, and reducing concurrency would definitely help.\n\nOn the GitLab server side, Gitaly needs to avoid saturation by limiting resource usage by these helper processes.  Both CPU time and memory are relevant to this problem.\n\nOne options is to limit the concurrency of the gRPC `PostUploadPack` calls, which spawn these `git pack-objects` helper processes.  (For context, the `git` client's fetch, pull, clone, etc. subcommand sends an HTTP POST request to the `[repo-url]/git-upload-pack` endpoint, which causes Rails to send Gitaly a `PostUploadPack` gRPC call.)  Using an instance-wide limit in combination with a smaller scoper limit per-namespace or per-project would allow the other projects to continue functioning while the busy peer is rate-limited.\n\nAnother possibility is using cgroups to impose a hard limit on resource usage by particular types of helper processes.  However, under certain workload patterns, that could result in starving all tenants of a Gitaly shard.  This may be better suited as a second line of defense, with the application-based concurrency limits acting as the primary defense with more graceful degradation behavior.\n\n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\n- What was the impact of the incident?  Slowness and intermittent errors for operations involving git repos stored on Gitaly shard `file-45`.\n- Who was impacted by this incident?  All customers having git repos stored on Gitaly shard `file-45` (roughly 2% of the repos on GitLab.com).\n- How did the incident impact customers?  Git operations would have been slow enough to sometimes timeout.\n- How many attempts were made to access the impacted service/feature?  Routine traffic over a 20 minute timespan\n- How many customers were affected?  Approximately 2% of repos were slow to access (sometimes up to timing out).  Unknown how many customers actively experienced this slowness.\n- How many customers tried to access the impacted service/feature?

Corresponding spikes in Gitaly error rate (due to timeouts) jumped as high as 0.6%.  A similar pattern was found on the earlier dates that we later backtracked this pathology to.\n\n#### Latency\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/gitaly-main/gitaly-overview?orgId=1\u0026from=1584378000000\u0026to=1584396000000\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=3\u0026var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-sigma=2\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-21-00](/uploads/9f029a264cdf89e7f9b6451632788943/Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-21-00.png)\n\n#### Error rate\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/gitaly-main/gitaly-overview?orgId=1\u0026from=1584378000000\u0026to=1584396000000\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=4\u0026var-PROMETHEUS_DS=Global\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-stage=main\u0026var-sigma=2\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-26-30](/uploads/ecaa2a365c57c1c85905a5be558866eb/Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-26-30.png)\n\n### Dashboard \"Host Stats\"\n\nThe host-level resource usage metrics for the affected Gitaly node (`file-45`) clearly show the CPU usage saturation and memory usage increase.\n\nNetwork egress throughput spiked as a result of sending the clients the git objects they needed, but the network throughput was nowhere near the saturation point.  Disk I/O (not shown) was not significantly affected.  Disk read throughput moderately increased but most disk I/O was satisfied by the filesystem cache, with physical disk I/O only increasing as a result of the cache being eroded by the anonymous memory allocations by the numerous `git pack-objects` processes. \n\n#### CPU usage\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/bd2Kl9Imk/host-stats?orgId=1\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-node=file-45-stor-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\u0026var-promethus=prometheus-01-inf-gprd\u0026from=1584378000000\u0026to=1584396000000\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=8\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-29-29](/uploads/0399bf11617d5f941ed26ab0c3367744/Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-29-29.png)\n\n#### Memory usage\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/bd2Kl9Imk/host-stats?orgId=1\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-node=file-45-stor-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\u0026var-promethus=prometheus-01-inf-gprd\u0026from=1584378000000\u0026to=1584396000000\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=39\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-31-17](/uploads/c7c94b0db43e90d19cecb7a1ed874b3c/Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-31-17.png)\n\n#### Network usage\n\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/bd2Kl9Imk/host-stats?orgId=1\u0026var-environment=gprd\u0026var-node=file-45-stor-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\u0026var-promethus=prometheus-01-inf-gprd\u0026from=1584378000000\u0026to=1584396000000\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=12\n\n![Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-32-21](/uploads/9deb042d4ef9df1bd6adbd90831945b2/Screenshot_from_2020-03-18_13-32-21.png)\n\n### Command line list of processes\n\n`top` shows the CPU usage was predominantly from the `git pack-objects` processes spawned by Gitaly, rather than by threads within Gitaly itself.  Note that each of these processes holds a significant amount of resident memory beyond its shared memory.\n\nAlso, each of these `git pack-objects` processes has accumulated many seconds of CPU time (some have several minutes of CPU time).  Follow-up analysis showed that these processes tended to have 40-60% of wall clock time spent on-CPU, at least during the regression; we suspect these processes are entirely CPU-bound and that their off-CPU time may have just been waiting for their next time slice, due to CPU starvation.\n\nThese `git pack-objects` processes were mostly operating on the same git repo directory (not shown), which is one of the ways we traced the regression back to its triggering conditions.\n\n#### Top processes using CPU time\n\n```shell\ntop - 20:03:16 up 67 days, 23:14,  2 users,  load average: 82.07,

`file-45` during the regression\n\nA CPU profile of all on-CPU processes shows that `git pack-objects` dominated CPU time and that they collectively spent most of their time calculating the deltas between what git objects the client request says it already has versus what the server-side bare repo has available to offer.  This suggests that the pathology is more likely to affect git repos with a large complex graph of object trees to compare.\n\n#### `perf` profile of on-CPU processes' stacks during the regression\n\n```shell\nmsmiley@file-45-stor-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:~$ sudo perf record --freq 99 -a -g -- sleep 10\n[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]\n[ perf record: Captured and wrote 5.118 MB perf.data (31680 samples) ]\n\nmsmiley@file-45-stor-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal:~$ sudo perf script --header \u003e perf-script.during_cpu_saturation_by_many_git_pack_objects_pids.out\n\nmsmiley@saoirse:~/src/git/public/FlameGraph [master|✔] $ cat /tmp/perf-script.during_cpu_saturation_by_many_git_pack_objects_pids.out | ./stackcollapse-perf.pl | ./flamegraph.pl \u003e /tmp/file-45.during_git_pack_objects_cpu_saturation.svg\n```\n\nComplete SVG of flame graph: [file-45.during_git_pack_objects_cpu_saturation.svg](/uploads/647be579053e398fe994aa73d94c319b/file-45.during_git_pack_objects_cpu_saturation.svg)\n\n![flame-graph.git-pack-objects-saturating-cpu-on-gitaly-node-file-45](/uploads/9e427542d6431045d5e257b911e0ee83/flame-graph.git-pack-objects-saturating-cpu-on-gitaly-node-file-45.png)\n\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- How was the incident detected? PagerDuty alerts such as [here](https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/incidents/PI1CE5Z) and [here](https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/incidents/PZESZJC): \"Gitaly error rate is too high\"\n- Did alarming work as expected?  Yes.\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection?  7 minutes.\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?  The regressions self-resolved roughly 10 minutes after the alert triggered.  Analysis of the regression continued after incidents resolved, and once we discovered enough about the pathology and triggering conditions, we reached out to the owner of the triggering repo.  We temporarily blocked the behavior for that repo to protect other customers from the side-effects, and worked with the customer to understand their use-case and mitigate the impact.\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident?  No.  We had all the necessary access to people and technology.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nA Gitaly node saturated its CPUs and significantly changed its memory usage profile.\n\n1. Why? - More CPU-bound memory-hungry processes were spawned than there are CPUs available on the host.\n2. Why? - Gitaly received numerous `PostUploadPack` gRPC calls from clients running `git fetch` (or similar), and Gitaly processed too many of them concurrently.\n3. Why? - Most repos are not prone to this pathology, so it has not yet been a focus of attention for Gitaly tuning.\n4. Why? - To trigger the pathology, the repo being accessed must have a very large object graph to traverse when composing a response to the client's `git fetch` (more specifically the `git` client's HTTP POST to `[repo_path]/git-upload-pack`).  Even for repos that meet this condition, to cause a regression on the Gitaly node, over 30 client requests to this repo must be concurrently running.\n5. Why? - The Gitaly server does not have enough CPU and memory capacity to handle workloads beyond the above specifications.  Once reaching the saturation point, all other Gitaly operations begin to slow down due to CPU starvation, with the degree of effect being proportional to the number of CPU-bound processes running.\n\n## What went well\n\n- Cross-team collaboration was fantastic!\n- IMOC and CMOC did a wonderful job (as usual!) of facilitating the investigation, getting help where needed, doing regular pulse checks, and guiding the balance of what info was ok to release publicly (as we were unsure at first whether this was a precursor to a malicious attack or an accidental outcome of a legitimate use-case).\n- Alerting worked appropriately.\n- Gitaly's and Rails' event logging to Elasticsearch gave us excellent observability into the app behavior and client request profile.\n- The CPU profiling tools (`perf` and BCC) gave us a clearer picture of what the CPU time was being spent on and which of the numerous git repos were associated with the bulk of the activity.\n\n## What can be improved\n\n- To prevent this from happening again, we need to prevent Gitaly from spawning enough `git` processes to saturate machine resources such as CPU and memory.  Gitaly already supports some forms of concurrency limiting, and tuning those may be sufficient.  Additional layers of protection (e.g. cgroups) could also be implemented, although we should consider the effects of saturation in each case and choose the most desirable failure mode for the health of the service as a whole when saturation is reached.  (For example, we prefer: slowness over downtime; downtime over possible corruption; automatic over manual recovery; etc.)\n- Each of the incidents in this 11-day series were low enough severity (`S3`) that we did not take the time to do root cause analysis until we noticed they were part of a recurring pattern.  Our on-call engineers field enough alerts, questions, and interruptions that we rarely have time to analyze self-recovering regressions like this.  This may be worth discussing as an iterative process improvement for incident triage.  Or maybe it's an acceptable cost of our existing prioritization scheme.\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n- Prevent Gitaly from running too many `git pack-objects` processes.\n    - Issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/9554\n    - Estimated date of completion: TBD\n    - Owner: TBD\n- For short-term mitigation, add support for removing user access to CI/CD without having to fully block the user.\n    - Issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35346\n    - Estimated date of completion: TBD\n    - Owner: TBD\n\n## Guidelines\n\n* [Blameless RCA Guideline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/root-cause-analysis/)\n* [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T18:06:27.682Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T13:54:33.852Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T20:35:14.416Z","closed_by":{"id":528408,"username":"asandov","name":"AnthonySandoval","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/528408/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/asandov"},"labels":["IncidentReview","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3947902,"username":"msmiley","name":"Matt Smiley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3947902/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msmiley"}],"author":{"id":3947902,"username":"msmiley","name":"Matt Smiley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3947902/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msmiley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3947902,"username":"msmiley","name":"Matt Smiley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3947902/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msmiley"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9550","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9550","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9550/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9550/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9550","relative":"#9550","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#9550"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32131630,"iid":9545,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Execute database benchmarking on Postgresql 11","description":"The goal is to check our load on PostgreSQL 11 and verify that the performance is similar or better.

These `git fetch` processes are always CPU-bound.  Because they tend to run for several minutes, it was easy to find one and do some profiling on it before it exited.  Repeating this a few times on different `git fetch` processes consistently showed the same pattern -- these particular `git fetch` processes spent a lot of time reading directories via the `getdents` syscall.\n\nThese slow CPU-intensive `git fetch` processes may or may not be why the Gitaly latency is high enough to alert -- it's plausible but not proven.\n\nI thought it was worth documenting, mainly because further investigation may lead to tuning the git config of the handful of GitLab-owned repos stored on this host.

Additionally, this is the final week for 360° feedback in Culture Amp. So, it's exceedingly important this sprint to work from the board! A few issues are carryovers from the May milestone–and you've already made significant progress on them–that should close quickly. There are also some related, blocking issues that will cascade to closed. I'm confident we'll hit over 90% this sprint.\r\n\r\nAs seen above, we have a need to dedicate the majority of our focus to alerting and monitoring fixes and tunings. Columns on the board continue issues labeled ~P1 ~P2 and ~P3, and whenever possible should be worked on in order of priority.\r\n\r\nThe o11y weekly meeting is on Tuesday, 02 Jun.

The bug and its work-arounds are described here:\n\nhttps://bundler.io/blog/2019/05/14/solutions-for-cant-find-gem-bundler-with-executable-bundle.html\n\nThis bug requires your `bundler` ruby gem to *exactly* match the version of bundler that last wrote the Gemfile.lock (indicated by that file's `BUNDLED WITH` line).\n\nIf you are using a version of ruby with the defective RubyGems that does not allow newer versions of bundler, then any bundler command will fail.  12 of our chef cookbooks currently pin the ruby version using a `.ruby-version` file (which is used by rbenv to switch the active ruby version).  Updating the pinned ruby version in `.ruby-version` to be \u003e= `2.6.3` would avoid this bug in RubyGems.  Our chef-repo itself is currently pinned to ruby 2.6.3, so I'd like to propose updating all 12 pinned cookbooks to use that same ruby version.\n\nNote that our cookbooks' CI pipeline `test` stage does not seem to be affected by this bug, presumably because it always runs in a container starting with a pristine ruby environment.\n\nQuestions for the team:\n1. Can anyone think of a reason not to do this?\n2. Apart from running each cookbook's rspec tests and letting the CI pipeline run its integration tests, what other testing would be appropriate?  Some cookbooks lack rspec tests for some recipes.\n\n#### Example of the problem\n\n```shell\n$ cat .ruby-version \n2.5.3\n\n$ rbenv install\n...\n\n$ rbenv version\n2.5.3 (set by

While we have no intent of publishing public issues or pages from ops.gitlab.net, the intent is for the ops installation to take over responsibility for more of our operational workflows (e.g. status page).\n\nAdditionally, adjustments will require substantial changes to the handbook instructing the Engineer On-Call to open production incidents on ops. We'll begin a campaign to inform the company of the switch, encouraging engineers and business stakeholders to verify or request access to ops. This will be necessary to view and contribute to ongoing incidents.\n\nLastly, we'll redirect Incident Management Automation workflows (\u0026100) and all other automation to use ops as the API endpoint for interaction with incident issues.\n\nThere will be a number of situations where we lose the convenience of cross referencing issues to other gitlab.com projects. We manage to handle this well enough with projects that primarily require participation from the infrastructure department alone. It could become more problematic when we need to increase visibility on issues that impact other business units.\n\nCc @marin @dawsmith @brentnewton

A root cause can **never be a person**, the way of writing has to refer to the system and the context rather than the specific actors.\n\nFollow the \"**5 whys**\" in a **blameless** manner as the core of the root-cause analysis.\n\nFor this it is necessary to start with the incident, and question why it happened. Keep iterating asking \"why?\" 5 times. While it's not a hard rule that it has to be 5 times, it helps to keep questions get deeper in finding the actual root cause. \n\nKeep in min that from one \"why?\" there may come more than one answer, consider following the different branches.\n\n### Example of the usage of \"5 whys\"\nThe vehicle will not start. (the problem)\n\n1. Why? - The battery is dead. \n2. Why? - The alternator is not functioning.\n3. Why? - The alternator belt has broken.\n4. Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. \n5. Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)\n\n## What went well\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Identify the things that worked well or as expected.\n- Any additional call-outs for what went particularly well.\n\n## What can be improved\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Using the root cause analysis, explain what can be improved to prevent this from happening again.\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the detection or time to detection?\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the response or time to response?\n- Is there an existing issue that would have either prevented this incident or reduced the impact?\n- Did we have any indication or beforehand knowledge that this incident might take place?\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n- List issues that have been created as corrective actions from this incident.\n- For each issue, include the following:\n    - \u003cBare Issue link\u003e - Issue labeled as ~\"corrective action\".\n    - Include an estimated date of completion of the corrective action.\n    - Incldue the named individual who owns the delivery of the corrective action.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n* [Blameless RCA Guideline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/root-cause-analysis/)\n* [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-18T21:09:11.461Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T16:54:47.298Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T15:42:39.193Z","closed_by":{"id":194566,"username":"cmcfarland","name":"Cameron McFarland","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0fea59864aa5c034e15089251bf9fa8f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cmcfarland"},"labels":["IncidentReview","Service::Web","severity::3","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":194566,"username":"cmcfarland","name":"Cameron McFarland","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0fea59864aa5c034e15089251bf9fa8f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cmcfarland"}],"author":{"id":194566,"username":"cmcfarland","name":"Cameron McFarland","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0fea59864aa5c034e15089251bf9fa8f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cmcfarland"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":194566,"username":"cmcfarland","name":"Cameron McFarland","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0fea59864aa5c034e15089251bf9fa8f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cmcfarland"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9234","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9234","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9234/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9234/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9234","relative":"#9234","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#9234"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30945722,"iid":9225,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Design database infrastructure for Praefect","description":"In order for Praefect to support replication coordination and failover it will rely on a PostgreSQL database.

As a result, we were seeing some jobs timing out on getting a db connection on those queues.\n\n- Service(s) affected : ~\"Service::Sidekiq\" \n- Team attribution : \n- Minutes downtime or degradation : \n\nFor calculating duration of event, use the [Platform Metrics Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ZUei7TkWz/platform-metrics?orgId=1) to look at appdex and SLO violations.\n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- What was the impact of the incident? (i.e. service outage, sub-service brown-out, exposure of sensitive data, ...)\n- Who was impacted by this incident? (i.e. external customers, internal customers, specific teams, ...)\n- How did the incident impact customers? (i.e. preventing them from doing X, incorrect display of Y, ...)\n- How many attempts were made to access the impacted service/feature?\n- How many customers were affected?\n- How many customers tried to access the impacted service/feature?\n\nInclude any additional metrics that are of relevance.\n\nProvide any relevant graphs that could help understand the impact of the incident and its dynamics.\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- How was the incident detected?\n- Did alarming work as expected?\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection?\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident? (i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team memeber wasn't page-able, ...)\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe purpose of this document is to understand the reasons that caused an incident, and to create mechanisms to prevent it from recurring in the future. A root cause can **never be a person**, the way of writing has to refer to the system and the context rather than the specific actors.\n\nFollow the \"**5 whys**\" in a **blameless** manner as the core of the root-cause analysis.\n\nFor this it is necessary to start with the incident, and question why it happened. Keep iterating asking \"why?\" 5 times. While it's not a hard rule that it has to be 5 times, it helps to keep questions get deeper in finding the actual root cause. \n\nKeep in min that from one \"why?\" there may come more than one answer, consider following the different branches.\n\n### Example of the usage of \"5 whys\"\nThe vehicle will not start. (the problem)\n\n1. Why? - The battery is dead. \n2. Why? - The alternator is not functioning.\n3. Why? - The alternator belt has broken.\n4. Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. \n5. Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)\n\n## What went well\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Identify the things that worked well or as expected.\n- Any additional call-outs for what went particularly well.\n\n## What can be improved\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Using the root cause analysis, explain what can be improved to prevent this from happening again.\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the detection or time to detection?\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the response or time to response?\n- Is there an existing issue that would have either prevented this incident or reduced the impact?\n- Did we have any indication or beforehand knowledge that this incident might take place?\n\n## Corrective actions\n\nFrom https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/9198#note_287817712\n\n* We have overridden the minimum connection pool size in `gitlab.rb` for the elasticsearch and export priorities and this has resolved the issue: https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/2668\n* The database connection pool should always have a minimum number pool size greater than some value (perhaps 5?) cc @mkaeppler @ayufan https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/issues/155\n* For higher concurrencies, it would be worth considering adding a few extra connections to the pool than the concurrency, as an insurance against deadlock cc @mkaeppler @ayufan https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/issues/155\n* We should report, through prometheus, connection pool utilisation in a process (on an interval, eg every 10 seconds?) - as a gauge metric. We should also record maximum pool size, so that we can add connection pool saturation as a saturation metric cc @mkaeppler @ayufan (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/issues/153)\n* Track down the cause of the exception rescues in the elastic indexer workers cc @DylanGriffith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/205640\n* Do not re-report old Sidekiq errors in future invocations https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25161\n* Do no mask errors behind `Sidekiq::JobRetry::Skip` exceptions\n* Reindex lost ES index jobs cc @DylanGriffith - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/1666\n\n## Guidelines\n\n* [Blameless RCA Guideline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/infrastructure/#rca)\n* [5

2020-02-11 High db insert rate caused by enabling issue templates on projects","description":"\u003c!--\n**Please note:** if the incident relates to sensitive data, or is security related consider\nlabeling this issue with ~security and mark it confidential.\n*** \n--\u003e\n\nIncident: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/1651\n\n## Summary\n\nEnabling instance templates for each project creation due to a bug, caused thousands of services to be created for each project creation (doing URL validation for each service, causing delays) which was causing a high db insert rate and latencies for web.\n\nAdditionally, because of copying the same template to the projects, many slack notifications from other projects were sent to out to one single project, which is a security issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/secops/operations/issues/650\n\n- Service(s) affected : ~\"Service::Web\" ~\"Service::Postgres\" \n- Team attribution : ~\"group::ecosystem\" \n- Minutes downtime or degradation : 153m (06:31 - 09:04)\n\nFor calculating duration of event, use the [Platform Metrics Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ZUei7TkWz/platform-metrics?orgId=1) to look at appdex and SLO violations.\n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- What was the impact of the incident? (i.e. service outage, sub-service brown-out, exposure of sensitive data, ...)\n- Who was impacted by this incident? (i.e. external customers, internal customers, specific teams, ...)\n- How did the incident impact customers? (i.e. preventing them from doing X, incorrect display of Y, ...)\n- How many attempts were made to access the impacted service/feature?\n- How many customers were affected?\n- How many customers tried to access the impacted service/feature?\n\nInclude any additional metrics that are of relevance.\n\nProvide any relevant graphs that could help understand the impact of the incident and its dynamics.\n\nDB inserts into `services` table:\n![image](/uploads/1910528a373d585508c28378e8ec5501/image.png)\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/RZmbBr7mk/gitlab-triage?orgId=1\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=8\u0026from=1581399974013\u0026to=1581413232942\n\nWeb saturation:\n![image](/uploads/4847c780a52743bee7ab3c36cc9c0ef6/image.png)\nhttps://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-service/general-service-platform-metrics?orgId=1\u0026fullscreen\u0026panelId=10\u0026from=1581400421276\u0026to=1581413397765\n\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- How was the incident detected?\n  - EOC was paged because of db replication lag caused by high insert rate, marquee customer alerts also triggered\n- Did alarming work as expected?\n  - We did not get SLO violation alerts, maybe the impact wasn't high enough - need to investigate\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection?\n  - 45m until [db replication alert](https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/incidents/PBP8ZVR?utm_source=slack\u0026utm_campaign=channel) fired (06:31 - 07:16)\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?\n  - 108m (07:16 - 09:04)\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident? (i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team member wasn't page-able, ...)\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nWe experienced high web latencies\n\n1. Why? - Because we suddenly started to create many services for each project creation, doing url lookups each service in `lib/gitlab/url_blocker.rb:111`, which took a lot of time (during a db transaction inserting into the `services` table).\n2. Why? - Because the instance creation attribute was set to `true` for each new project.\n3. Why? - Because a [db migration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23595/diffs#diff-content-abca773d09b69a0771e11f06ab0d9e92ab632889) with a column rename created a trigger to set `instance = template`, which enabled the previously disabled attribute\n4. Why? - Because we had two versions of the codebase running at the same time, one would set a `template` to false when creating a new service, and the other would set `instance` to false but leave `template` as true (and therefore repopulate `instance` as true based on the trigger)\n5. Why? - Service code is old and does some things we probably would not accept now like not having unique constraints on project_id and service type.

The manager host acts as a CA and signs its own client cert as well as the per-VM server cert.  The CA and client certs have a 3-year lifespan, and when they expire, the next invocation of `docker-machine create` will generate a fresh pair of certs.  However, in a high-throughput environment like GitLab.com, it is very likely that multiple docker-machine processes will concurrently try to generate new certs, each one overwriting the other's work.  This can lead to mismatched or corrupt CA and client certs.  When that occurs (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/1609#note_283265339), the host running docker-machine can provision new VMs, but those VMs reject all attempts to authenticate to its `dockerd` daemon using the damaged or untrusted client cert.  Consequently, the manager host fails to run every job it pulls.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-06T22:41:34.114Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T17:53:51.228Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T06:24:44.145Z","closed_by":{"id":210928,"username":"steveazz","name":"Steve Azzopardi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a5eeed7ec5c80642df9ee708bb496d7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/steveazz"},"labels":["Service::CI Runners","corrective action","severity::2","team::Reliability","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3947902,"username":"msmiley","name":"Matt Smiley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3947902/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msmiley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9156","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9156","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9156/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9156/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9156","relative":"#9156","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#9156"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30481273,"iid":9147,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Terraform error re-creating forwarding rule for load balancer","description":"When deleting a load balancer and then re-creating it and its forwarding rule, we get an error due to not specifying the subnet.\n\n```\nError: Error creating ForwardingRule: googleapi: Error 400: Invalid value for field 'resource.subnetwork': ''.

production using a cluster with a replica ( read-only )","description":"The idea of this task is to create a test scenario for the PostgreSQL upgrade( pg 9.6 and 11.6 ), with a database with a size like production. \n\nWe should have a similar hardware setup as the production boxes in these boxes.\n\nWe the idea here is to get estimative of time that we need to execute the task of the upgrade.\n\nThe cluster could have 3 nodes.\n\n\n\n# Step by step for PG_UPGRADE(master and standby)\n\n\n@adescoms @sergio.ostapowicz @Finotto \nThe following  steps  are for executing `pg_upgrade` for upgrade from PG 9.6 to 11.7, \nthis was tested on servers `patroni-migrate-01-db-gstg.c.gitlab-staging-1.internal` and `patroni-migrate-02-db-gstg.c.gitlab-staging-1.internal`. \n\n***preliminary version***\n\n# Upgrade with pg_upgrade\n\nBefore executing the `pg_upgrade` some issue have to be resolved and are related with:\n\n - Server 9.6 have the extension `pg_repack` installed (solution, install pg_repack for PG 11)\n - Some views, functions, and queries from `postgres exporter` are incompatible with PG 11 (solution, like a workaround, rewrite the views and functions and add some wrapper functions for queries) \n - Make a copy to all configs file \n \n\nTo execute `pg_upgrade` in gitlab server you must follow the next steps: \n\n 1. Remove the following view and functions from PG 9.6\n\n\t   *  views : \"postgres_exporter\".\"pg_stat_replication\", \"postgres_exporter\".\"pg_stat_wal_receiver\"\n       *  functions : postgres_exporter.f_select_pg_stat_replication(), public.f_pg_stat_wal_receiver()\n\t  \n   1.1 Make sure all connections out , checkpoint in master and check replica status , \n\nAdd to pg_hba.conf from PG 9.6 the line\n  ```\nhost all all 0.0.0.0/0 reject\n  ```\n\nConnect to postgres database\n    \n```\n   select pg_terminate_backend(pid) from pg_stat_activity where datname='gitlabhq_production'; --disconnecto all from gitlabhq_production database\n   checkpoint ;\n   select * from pg_stat_replication ;\n\n```\n\n 2. Stop PG 9.6 if is  running in all server\n\n 3. Install postgresql-11 and stop service,  *ignore if is already installed and stopped*\n    * apt-get install postgresql-11\n    * pg_ctlcluster 11 main stop\n   \n 4. Create the path (*data11* or the name that you want) for the new PG cluster a give the correct permission\n ```\n     mkdir /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11\n     chown gitlab-psql:gitlab-psql /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11\n     chmod 700 /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11/\n```\n 5. Create the new cluster database with user `gitlab-psql` in master\n    ```\n    su gitlab-psql\n    /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/./initdb -D /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11 --locale=C.UTF-8 --encoding=UTF8\n    ```\n 6. Enable to connect locally \"trust\" on pg_hba(/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf) by adding the following line to the beginning of the file\n    * local   all         all                              trust\n 7. Install the pg_repack extension for PG 11\n   ```\napt-get install postgresql-11-repack\n\n--optional, compile from source code\nwget http://api.pgxn.org/dist/pg_repack/1.4.5/pg_repack-1.4.5.zip\nunzip pg_repack-1.4.5.zip -d ./pg_repack\ncd pg_repack/pg_repack-1.4.5/\nmake  PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_config\n--like a root \nmake install PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_config\n\n```\n\n\n8. Install the postgresql 11 server on standby server and pg_repack extension\n```\napt-get install postgresql-11-repack\n\n--optional, compile from source code\n\nwget http://api.pgxn.org/dist/pg_repack/1.4.5/pg_repack-1.4.5.zip\nunzip pg_repack-1.4.5.zip -d ./pg_repack\ncd pg_repack/pg_repack-1.4.5/\nmake  PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_config\n--like a root \nmake install PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_config\n```\n  9.\tCheck if all fine before execute pg_upgrade in master\n   ```\n   su gitlab-psql\n /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_upgrade --old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin --new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin --old-datadir /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data --new-datadir /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11/ -o \"-c config_file=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/postgresql.conf\" -O \"-c config_file=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11/postgresql.conf\"  --check --link\n  ``` \n 10.\tIf the result from above is *Clusters are compatible* then execute the upgrade\n```\n--takes approximately 10 sec\nsu gitlab-psql\n /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_upgrade --old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin --new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin --old-datadir /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data --new-datadir /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11/ -o \"-c config_file=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/postgresql.conf\" -O \"-c config_file=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11/postgresql.conf\"  --link\n  ``` \t\n 11. If the result from above is *Upgrade Complete* then test start PG 11 , make sure the config are correct or with the values that you need and test start/stop PG service\n ```\nsu gitlab-psql\n cd /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/ \n./postgres -D /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11 -c \"config_file=/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql/data11/postgresql.conf\"\n\nstop server\n  ``` \t\n\n### *Upgrade standby replicas*\n12.

Copy to standby server the data for PG 11 and delta from PG 9.6, configure the recovery.conf to connecto to master PG 11\n```\ncd  /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql\nrsync --archive --delete --hard-links --size-only --no-inc-recursive  data data11 10.224.42.102:/var/opt/gitlab/postgresql\n```  \n\n\n14. Config the replica setting if is necessary \n15. Confing standby ,  Start master  and standby server\nrecovery.conf\n```\nrecovery_target_timeline = 'latest'\nstandby_mode = 'on'\nprimary_conninfo = 'user=gitlab-replicator password=password host=IP port=5432  application_name=your_name'\nprimary_slot_name = 'your_slot_name'\n```\n\n16. Create the replication slot in master\n```\n select pg_create_physical_replication_slot('your_slot_name');\n ``` \n \n \n17.

Limiting Specific URL's","description":"Currently, there is not a straightforward way to rate limit access to specific URL's.  We can either allow a URL or block it.  It would be very useful to be able to set limits on how many times per minute a single client can request a URL, or how many times per minute a URL can be requested in total.  A flexible way to specify this would add significantly to the site's resilience.\n\n## Wishlist\n\n- It would be nice to be able to specify a URL regex, for example to rate limit all `*.zip` files.\n- It would be nice to be able to rate limit groups of users differently, including unauthenticated users\n- It would be nice to be able to rate limit IP's and CIDR ranges separately from users.\n- It would be nice to be able to limit on other criteria such as User-Agent\n\n## Things to consider\n\n- Some larger organizations will be behind NAT's and all users will appear to be from the same IP\n- Cloudflare may appear to make a lot of requests from the same IP, so we'll need to be able to differentiate the proxy server from the end user\n- A DDoS may be distributed, and may appear to come from many IP's.  We should still have a way to set a high threshold for how many times a specific URL can be requested at all.  This should be much higher than the single IP threshold\n- We should be careful not to limit internal components such as sidekiq inadvertently\n\n## Related things\n\n- Here is an incident that this would have prevented: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/9047\n- Here is some related work happening in the product: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30829\n- Here is a related corrective action for API rate limiting: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6645","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-28T05:41:08.946Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T17:55:22.017Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T08:10:28.388Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["corrective action","severity::4","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/9048","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9048","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9048/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/9048/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9048","relative":"#9048","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#9048"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":289,"epic":{"id":88204,"iid":289,"title":"Cloudflare Automation Implementation","url":"/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/289","group_id":1112072,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29895201,"iid":9024,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Replace staging certificate in Cloudflare","description":"The certificate for `staging.gitlab.com` has been updated in the GKMS vault and on the servers.

I discovered that we would have to change the module type that we use to provision the geo-staging instance from generic-store to generic-sv-with-group - or write a whole new module. This is in addition to adding individual resources for health checks, backends, url_maps's and various other things.  Writing a whole new module is the right way to do this, but that's too much work for a one off which will only be used for development work.\n- Provisioning an external IP address and creating a firewall rule to allow access directly to this node.  This is what I'm going with for the moment, since it is the simplest and there is no need for anything more complicated.  This will get us unblocked and we can revisit it in the future.\n\nTo provision the external address we need:\n\n- A static external IP associated with the node\n- A Firewall rule allowing this access to the node\n- A DNS entry\n- A certificate or SAN for SSL connections to the interface","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-17T21:20:03.261Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T17:56:34.995Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T23:54:50.586Z","closed_by":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"labels":["Service::Geo","unblocks others","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"}],"author":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/8965","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/8965","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/8965/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/8965/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#8965","relative":"#8965","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#8965"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
