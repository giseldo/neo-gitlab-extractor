Fails over staging.gitlab.com to a Geo-based secondary\n1. Tests that staging.gitlab.com works on this secondary\n1. Fails back over to the original staging.gitlab.com infrastructure.\n\nWhat needs to happen to facilitate this:\n- [ ] Apply changes and learnings from the first single-node test.\n- [ ] Build a change management issue to track the tactical pieces to this failover.\n- [ ] Coordinate with various consumers of staging to help define a testing schedule and what we will need to have in place in the event we are without staging for an extended period of time","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-07T12:57:25.486Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T20:18:45.442Z","closed_at":"2021-01-13T20:18:45.132Z","closed_by":{"id":2524675,"username":"skarbek","name":"John Skarbek","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c6455ce4726023aac6dd7fb0acd1f236?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/skarbek"},"labels":["wg-disaster-recovery","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":{"id":1739582,"iid":116,"group_id":1112072,"title":"Datastores team - W02","description":"Datastores iteration for the second/third weeks of 2021.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-24T09:38:22.429Z","updated_at":"2021-11-12T05:28:12.161Z","due_date":"2021-01-24","start_date":"2021-01-11","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/116"},"assignees":[{"id":3059703,"username":"hphilipps","name":"Henri Philipps","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3059703/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hphilipps"},{"id":4437855,"username":"brentnewton","name":"Brent Newton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4437855/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brentnewton"}],"author":{"id":4437855,"username":"brentnewton","name":"Brent Newton","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4437855/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brentnewton"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3059703,"username":"hphilipps","name":"Henri Philipps","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3059703/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hphilipps"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-12-17","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/12084","time_stats":{"time_estimate":28800,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":"8h","human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/12084","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/12084/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/12084/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#12084","relative":"#12084","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#12084"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":371,"epic":{"id":159463,"iid":371,"title":"Evaluate Geo as a disaster recovery solution for GitLab.com","url":"/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/371","group_id":1112072,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 21, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75565488,"iid":12062,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Modify Fastly headers to accommodate same-origin content in frames","description":"\u003c!--\nThis template is for GitLab Team Members seeking support of SRE where there isn't an existing `request-*` template available.\n\nPlease fill out the details below.\n--\u003e\n\n**Details** \n\n - Point of contact for this request: @djensen\n - If a call is needed, what is the proposed date and time of the call:  n/a\n - Additional call details (format, type of call): n/a\n\n**SRE Support Needed**\n\nPlease modify Fastly headers for about.gitlab.com to allow for `\u003cobject\u003e` tags to be used with same-origin content (to allow [clickable SVGs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/10052#proposal)):\n\n1.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/11730#note_455197827\n\n\u003e I have a rough idea of how we can sandbox the read-only console pretty well.\n\u003e \n\u003e We can force SSH to not start a shell, but rather a transient systemd-unit that is forwarded via SSH. That we can lock down as tight as we need to (filesystem ro, partially ro, even network access can be sandboxed to specific hosts). By forcing every user to access the rails-console via that, we can make sure, that whatever we configure is confined in the sandbox and the appropriate config files would be to.\n\u003e \n\u003e We should probably have one designated write-only target though if someone needs to export something. But if the user is unprivileged, they would need the interaction of another person to get the exports. That way we can also eliminate possible scenarios where someone might have gone rouge (which hopefully never happens!)  \nThat way we can also prevent users from shelling out of rails into the OS.

The gitlab application now tracks migration state itself and exposes an API to monitor the state of a given migration.\n2. The gitlab application project repository storage move API has significantly reduced error rates for migrations and increased stability to the point that the quarantine features here may not be necessary, since it is my understanding that they are designed to prevent repeated attempts to migrate repositories whose migrations had already failed.\n\nNew `gitlab.com` API is at `projects/\u003cproject_id\u003e/repository_storage_moves`.\n\nIt doesn't even appear that the defacto GitLab client ruby gem has support for this API, either.  As of 2020-11-10, there are no results for: https://github.com/NARKOZ/gitlab/search?q=repository_storage_moves  But maybe this is a naive query.\n\nIt is unclear to me whether the Firestore datastore features surrounding migration state management and quarantining are of much use after such an update.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-10T22:29:08.394Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T12:38:08.473Z","closed_at":"2020-11-13T15:52:08.187Z","closed_by":{"id":4006601,"username":"nnelson","name":"Nels

As discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/11113 we aren't going to be affected by this because we are using the [GCP mirror](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pulling-cached-images). However this mirror is only configured when pulling images for the job, it is **not** configured for the docker daemons that start [docker in docker](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-workflow-with-docker-executor).\n\nIf users are using [docker in docker](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-workflow-with-docker-executor) to build their image, it is going to pull the base images it needs to build the image. Since the docker daemon that is started by dind is not configured to use the mirror it might reach some rate limits.\n\n## Proposal\n\nFollow https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#docker-executor-inside-gitlab-runner-configuration by having our Shared runner fleet automatically mount `/etc/docker/daemon.json` that is configured to use [GCP DockerHub mirror](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pulling-cached-images) so even our docker in docker builds will use the mirror.\n\nWhat we would need to do:\n\n1. Update the base VM image that is used in CI to include a `daemon.json` somewhere in the runner manager to have the config below.\n    \u003cdetails\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e daemon.json \u003c/summary\u003e\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"registry-mirrors\": [\n        \"https://registry-mirror.example.com\"\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    \u003c/details\u003e\n\n1. Update the shared runner fleet configuration like below.\n\n    \u003cdetails\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e config.toml \u003c/summary\u003e\n\n    ```toml\n    [[runners]]\n      ...\n      executor = \"docker\"\n      [runners.docker]\n        image = \"alpine:3.12\"\n        privileged = true\n        volumes = [\"/opt/docker/daemon.json:/etc/docker/daemon.json:ro\"]\n    ```\n    \u003c/details\u003e\n\n## Possible problems\n\n### When users have are configuring the mirror through `command`\n\n**This will be a breaking change for certain users**\n\nWhen a user has the following `command` defined in their `.gitlab-ci.yml` to specify a mirror (they can do this already) and we mount the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` the service is going to fail with the error below.\n\nUser updated docker `dind` service to specify a mirror themselves\n```yaml\nservices:\n   - name: docker:19.03.13-dind\n     command: [\"--registry-mirror\", \"https://registry-mirror.example.com\"] # Specify the registry mirror to use.\n```\n\nGitLab CI failure\n```shell\n2020-11-02T08:18:33.103369077Z unable to configure the Docker daemon with file /etc/docker/daemon.json: the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration file: registry-mirrors: (from flag: [https://mirror.gcr.io/], from file: [https://registry-mirror.example.com])\n```\n\n### Users don't expect the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to be present\n\nThere might be some jobs out that that don't expect the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to be present which might also break their jobs if we start mounting this file.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-02T08:23:32.491Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T12:38:59.341Z","closed_at":"2021-01-07T16:23:00.633Z","closed_by":{"id":210928,"username":"steveazz","name":"Steve Azzopardi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a5eeed7ec5c80642df9ee708bb496d7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/steveazz"},"labels":["AssistType::GitLabAdmin","AssistingTeam::Development","Core-Infra::P2","Service::CI Runners","Unplanned","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":{"id":1722318,"iid":115,"group_id":1112072,"title":"Core-Infra Dec 27-Jan 9 '21 Unplanned items","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-12T21:13:14.237Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T00:25:04.544Z","due_date":"2021-01-09","start_date":"2020-12-27","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/115"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":210928,"username":"steveazz","name":"Steve Azzopardi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a5eeed7ec5c80642df9ee708bb496d7?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/steveazz"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11781","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":13,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/11781","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/11781/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/11781/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11781","relative":"#11781","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#11781"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73589795,"iid":11762,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Create terraform repo for transient-import project","description":"We get requests often to make VMs for customer project imports (ex: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/11695). As of now, these are manually provisioned by someone in infra and handed off to the support or professional services engineer performing the import. I think we could be much more efficient if we made a terraform repo and allowed engineers to mostly self-service the creation of servers.\n\nI propose that we re-use the [GCP module in dev-resources](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/dev-resources/-/tree/master/modules/gcp) to make this possible. This module was written for support to create VMs in a similar way for interviews or other testing purposes. The main thing we would need to modify is to remove the chef provisioning part and add a firewall rule to the module to allow the support engineer to access via SSH. \n\nSince much of the terraform is done, this shouldn't take too long to do and would make both infra and support more efficient in these requests.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-29T16:44:24.430Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T21:58:14.167Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T23:31:14.276Z","closed_by":{"id":429540,"username":"ahanselka","name":"Alex

As part of the upcoming registry upgrade (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/191), we will need to create an inventory of the repositories that exist in the current registry buckets. We may also need to examine these during the upgrade. For this reason, we need to be able to list/scan the buckets using the GCS API. This requires a service account with read access (`Viewer` role, I believe). Having this access is also useful to debug customer issues in general.\n\nDecide if we want to make a service account or just give viewer role to the two developers temporarily.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-23T16:16:10.359Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T20:48:07.982Z","closed_at":"2021-02-12T22:01:39.038Z","closed_by":{"id":429540,"username":"ahanselka","name":"Alex Hanselka","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/429540/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahanselka"},"labels":["AssistType::CloudInfra","AssistingTeam::Development","unblocks others","workflow-infra::Done"],"milestone":{"id":1808963,"iid":124,"group_id":1112072,"title":"Core-Infra Jan 31 - Feb 13","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-05T23:32:25.348Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T21:07:05.795Z","due_date":"2021-02-13","start_date":"2021-01-31","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/124"},"assignees":[{"id":429540,"username":"ahanselka","name":"Alex Hanselka","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/429540/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahanselka"}],"author":{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":429540,"username":"ahanselka","name":"Alex Hanselka","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/429540/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ahanselka"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/11713","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/11713","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/11713/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/11713/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11713","relative":"#11713","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#11713"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73108670,"iid":11688,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Readiness Review for Jaeger","description":"This checklist is sourced from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/production_readiness.md.\n\nLink to the Jaeger runbook, which covers majority of the points listed below: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/jaeger/README.md\n\nThe scope of this review is:\n- deploying Jaeger to the production environment\n- Elasticsearch instance deployed to Elastic Cloud (used as storage backend for the Jaeger service)\n- Labkit instrumentation\n\n## Summary\n\n* [x] Short overview mentioning purpose of the service, dependencies and owners\n* [x] Explain the scope of this review and what is explicitly out of scope.\n\n## Architecture\n\n* [x] Runbook README.md contains an architecture overview (provide link)\n  * [x] Runbook README.md contains a logical architecture diagram\n  * [x] Runbook README.md contains a physical architecture diagram (optional)\n  * [x] Runbook README.md provides enough information for a reviewer to get an\n    understanding of the service and it's components, dependencies and\n    interactions\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [x] is there a blue print/design doc?

#elasticsearch-lab Slack bot for the Elasticsearch API","description":"The idea is to replicate the success of the `#database-lab` Slack channel but instead for the Elasticsearch index instead of the database.\n\n### What would it look like\n\nThere would be a new app in Slack that has read-only access to our Elasticsearch index (`grpd`) and would profile/validate the query sent to it, redacting any matching documents.\n\nThe bot would then issue the query, and upload the redacted response to the channel as a file upload. Some metadata (like the **query time**, the **result count**, etc…) could be shown directly in the bot's response. \n\n### Why would this be useful\n\nAs the usage of the Advanced Search ramps up, we will have to diagnose more slow queries and test improvements, such as https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225998\n\n### Implementation\n\n  - [ ] Do a security review of the Elasticsearch Profile API to ensure the data safety\n  - [ ] Create a Slack application to manage the Elasticsearch calls\n  - [ ] Add the application to our Slack workplace \n\n### References\n\n  - Elasticsearch
