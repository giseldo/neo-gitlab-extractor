I went to more than these talks obviously, but that's all the notes I have.\n\nThe [conference schedule](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/) also contains links to slides.\n\nMy TOP3 talks are about HyperLogLog algorithm for counting, various index types in PG and spatial analysis with PostGIS.\n\n### Training: Dig the WAL\n\n[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/loxodata/dig-thewal-pgconfeu2018) [Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/sessions/session/2069-dig-the-wal/)\n\nIn the half-day training, we were looking into WAL details and how to use this to recover certain catastrophic situations. The speakers had automated examples of recovering clusters using PITR, understanding conflicts with logical replication and using pg_rewind to recover split brain situations.\n\nApart from the rather high-level discussion, my take aways were\n\n* Logging DDL statements along with txids is tremendously helpful https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5502\n* Group commit can considerably reduce amount of fsyncs required https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5503 \n* `\\gset` is really useful for scripting with `psql`\n\n### TOP3 Talk: Location - the universal foreign key. Past, present and future of spatial PostgreSQL\n\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xyXA4-0wmNX7WfiLeH9h10bIkZxrej278-mMaClagys/edit?usp=sharing) [Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2020-location-the-universal-foreign-key-past-present-and-future-of-spatial-data-in-postgresql/)\n\nThe talk was given by Paul Ramsey (himself!) and he beautifully managed to build a bridge for database folks into GIS land. The spatial analysis examples were awesome, for example he correlated starbucks locations with income data and more. If you never worked with spatial data before:\n\n* How to get spatial data: ogr2ogr\n* How to visualize it: gqis\n* How to load, how to analyze: postgis\n\nPersonally, it was a good reminiscence of my bachelor thesis covering different spatial databases.\n\n### TOP3 Talk: Cleaning out crocodiles teeth with PostgreSQL indexes - a story on all the index types in PG\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2119-cleaning-out-crocodiles-teeth-with-postgresql-indexes-a-story-on-all-the-index-types-in-pg/) \n\nGreat talk by Louise Grandjonc (Citus Data): Covered implementation details of b-tree, GIN, GiST, SP-GiST, BRIN and Hash indexes and how they compare.\n\n### TOP3 Talk: The HyperLogLog Algorithm: How it works and why you will love it\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2210-the-hyperloglog-algorithm-how-it-works-and-why-you-will-love-it/) \n\nTheory behind HyperLogLog algorithm to implement efficient `COUNT(DISTINCT)` queries in PostgreSQL. \n\nIf you always wondered how HLL works - this is the talk to read: [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bn_LOUwaZiKAcat_LtyyeqY-NxRohFqo6uJYrMvpnM8/edit) \n\n### Talk: PostgreSQL worst practices\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2169-postgresql-worst-practices/)\n\nCountless worst practices presented by a database consultant. Excerpts for bingo play:\n\n* Disallow access to the production database to developers. Not even read-only.\n* Always use a ORM\n* Count everything precisely (this is like all over the place in GitLab, counting is really hard at scale and we have a few anti patterns implemented that do not scale, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/52096 and related issues/discussions)\n* In-memory joins\n* Be in trend, be schemaless, use JSONB\n* Be agile, use EAV\n* (and many more)\n\n### Talk: Advanced logical replication\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2173-advanced-logical-replication/)\n\nThis talk detailed how to implement a transactional, at-least-once message queue using logical decoding in PostgreSQL (based on `pg_logical_emit_message`). This seems relevant to our needs regarding [Geo design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7420) - it would be a great way of introducing a transactional queue without introducing another dependency (to like Kafka or others).\n\nThe talk also covered online upgrades ([relevant to us](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/4937)) and bi-directional replication.\n\n### Talk: Around the World With Extensions\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2000-around-the-world-with-extensions/)\n\nGreat overview of available extensions including cool stuff like [HyperLogLog counting](https://github.com/citusdata/postgresql-hll), [TOP-N](https://github.com/citusdata/postgresql-topn), [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) or sharding with citus.\n\n### Talk: High Performance pgBackRest\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2013-high-performance-pgbackrest/)\n\nDetails of pgBackRest and how it implements parallelism for backup and restore. Claims to be able to push 20 TB worth of WAL per hour (async parallel push) - if network keeps up with it.\n\nThis is relevant to us discussing replacing wal-e for various reasons ([design pending](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5022)).\n\n### Talk: Advanced PostgreSQL backup and recovery methods\n\n[Description](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2098-advanced-postgresql-backup-and-recovery-methods/)\n\nGreat overview of different backup/recover tools available for PostgreSQL and how they compare.","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-11-06T10:08:56.178Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T17:44:02.446Z","closed_at":"2018-11-12T12:45:55.370Z","closed_by":{"id":1562869,"username":"abrandl","name":"Andreas

#3777:* Firing 1 - CPU use percent is extremely high on postgres-dr-archive-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal for the past 2 hours.","description":"## Summary\n\n### Issue\nCPU utilization alert triggered for: postgres-dr-archive-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal\n\n### Investigation\nBunch of wal-e processes appear to be taking up most of the CPU but CPU has been utilized \u003e 90% for quite some time (though it spiked down below 90% at times as well). In postgresql log, we see errors indicating absolute URIs not being able to be loaded - which could be causing the CPU jump. A PD incident# 3776 was also fired earlier for postgres-dr-delayed node for a delayed replica and the node was also consuming high CPU. (Could be related and we decided to wait until POC in EMEA looks at it). For detailed investigation, see comments below.\n\n### Proximal Root Cause\nThe URIs that could not be loaded might be causing retries and/or subsequent tasks/steps not to be completed properly causing loops and consequently causing high CPU utilization. Since this is not yet a definite root cause, hence the name: \"proximal\". \n\n### Mitigation\nThe alert cleared on its own for now.

big projects for customers","description":"## TL;DR  \n\nCustomers and potential ones may want to import a large project into GitLab.com. This isssue is to provide a workaround in a timely manner for them.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the past, for big imports such as the K8S import, we had a dedicated instance that helped us achieve this.\n\nLarge imports, will either timeout (we have a timeout of a few hours) or will get killed by the Sidekiq Memory Killer. This is becoming a bit more frequent as the app grows larger, and the Sidekiq process eats more memory.\n\nWe improved the Import mechanism so it doesn't use as much memory at the cost of getting a bit slower (executing less transactions in a single commit, keeping less objects in memory). This can be tweaked, but either way, we'll either hit a memory issue or a timeout problem. The next big step would be to separate this into different independent workers in order to save memory, but it's not a small refactor.\n\n## Why?\n\nThis will help Support/Sales\n\n## Current workarounds\n\nFor a self-hosted instance, this is easy to workaround by either increasing the Sidekiq RSS memory allowed and/or disabling the worker that kills the imports when a certain timeout is reached.\n\nFor GitLab.com, we can't tweak that. So we normally get rid of `pipelines` or heavy objects in the exported project in order to free a bit more memory. But we could still encounter the problem.\n\n## Example\n\nI managed to import a ~900MB export in my DO instance, averaging an RSS of 850MB, peak at 950MB (note that practically half of this is just loading the Rails app). The default max RSS at GitLab.com is ~~1GB~~ (2GB now). But this wouldn't work at GitLab.com - What's the difference? The thread where the import ran in my DO instance wasn't shared by any other thread, as that was the only thing the process was doing (the other threads were free).\n\n## Proposal\n\nFor prospects or customers, use the deploy node to run a script that does this for us, without the memory limits we would normally hit.\n\nWe'll need to:\n\n1. (James) Provide a script that calls the I/E logic provided an export archive and a target (easy).\n1. (James) Document somewhere how this works. We may need to use tmux/screen.\n1. (Infra) Confirm this is OK. I would suggest every time we have to do this we ping the oncall.\n1. (Support) Confirm the identity of the customer to verify access to the target namespace.\n1. (Support) Ping the oncall when this is required from a customer.\n\n## Alternative\n\nMaybe we can automate this hooking it into ChatOps and use a runner with enough memory :thinking: But haven't put much thought about it.\n\n## Related: \n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/dotcom/dotcom-escalations/issues/2 \n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/52956\n\ncc @cynthia @dawsmith @lmcandrew","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-26T13:24:13.786Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T22:47:59.403Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T19:54:59.405Z","closed_by":{"id":478289,"username":"northrup","name":"John Northrup","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f076b1aa65652a2852e897baf0a65ba0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/northrup"},"labels":["unblocks others","unscheduled"],"milestone":{"id":697388,"iid":55,"project_id":1304532,"title":"2018-12-01 Completed","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-11-01T18:53:32.778Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T15:24:38.720Z","due_date":"2018-12-01","start_date":"2018-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/milestones/55"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James Lopez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/273486/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jameslopez"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/5384","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5384","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5384/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/5384/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5384","relative":"#5384","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#5384"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":15275488,"iid":5382,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Ephemeral Environments Demo Video","description":"Rather than trying to schedule a bunch of zoom calls to show how CI/CD works for [Ephemeral Environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5285), I've created this video so that everyone can watch it when it's convenient.

Issue #5276 and it's merge requests are the appropriate place for that conversation.\n\n- The code that the video skims over is visible at: https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/environments and if you are curious what is actually happening in the pipelines you can see the output at https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/environments/pipelines\n\n- We could use a lot more discussion on how this should all work. The design doc issue is #5285 and it's merge requests are still pending comments.\n\n- This project probably needs to move from my workspace to the ops instance\n\n/cc @gitlab\\-com/gl\\-infra -
