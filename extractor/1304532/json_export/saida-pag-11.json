it confidential.\n***\n\n## Summary\n\nA brief summary of what happened. Try to make it as executive-friendly as possible.\n\nService(s) affected :\nTeam attribution : \nMinutes downtime or degradation : \n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- What was the impact of the incident? (i.e. service outage, sub-service brown-out, exposure of sensitive data, ...)\n- Who was impacted by this incident? (i.e. external customers, internal customers, specific teams, ...)\n- How did the incident impact customers? (i.e. preventing them from doing X, incorrect display of Y, ...)\n- How many attempts were made to access the impacted service/feature?\n- How many customers were affected?\n- How many customers tried to access the impacted service/feature?\n\nInclude any additional metrics that are of relevance.\n\nProvide any relevant graphs that could help understand the impact of the incident and its dynamics.\n\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- How was the incident detected?\n- Did alarming work as expected?\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection?\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident? (i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team memeber wasn't page-able, ...)\n\n## Timeline\n\nYYYY-MM-DD\n\n- 00:00 UTC - something happened\n- 00:01 UTC - something else happened\n- ...\n\nYYYY-MM-DD+1\n\n- 00:00 UTC - and then this happened\n- 00:01 UTC - and more happened\n- ...\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe purpose of this document is to understand the reasons that caused an incident, and to create mechanisms to prevent it from recurring in the future. A root cause can **never be a person**, the way of writing has to refer to the system and the context rather than the specific actors.\n\nFollow the \"**5 whys**\" in a **blameless** manner as the core of the root-cause analysis.\n\nFor this it is necessary to start with the incident, and question why it happened. Keep iterating asking \"why?\" 5 times. While it's not a hard rule that it has to be 5 times, it helps to keep questions get deeper in finding the actual root cause. \n\nKeep in min that from one \"why?\" there may come more than one answer, consider following the different branches.\n\n###Example of the usage of \"5 whys\"\nThe vehicle will not start. (the problem)\n\n1. Why? - The battery is dead. \n2. Why? - The alternator is not functioning.\n3. Why? - The alternator belt has broken.\n4. Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. \n5. Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)\n\n## What went well\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Identify the things that worked well or as expected.\n- Any additional call-outs for what went particularly well.\n\n## What can be improved\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- Using the root cause analysis, explain what can be improved to prevent this from happening again.\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the detection or time to detection?\n- Is there anything that could have been done to improve the response or time to response?\n- Is there an existing issue that would have either prevented this incident or reduced the impact?\n- Did we have any indication or beforehand knowledge that this incident might take place?\n\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n- List issues that have been created as corrective actions from this incident.\n- For each issue, include the following:\n    - \u003cBare Issue link\u003e - Issue labeled as ~\"corrective action\".\n    - Include an estimated date of completion of the corrective action.\n    - Incldue the named individual who owns the delivery of the corrective action.\n\n\n## Guidelines\n\n* [Blameless RCA Guideline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/infrastructure/#rca)\n* [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-18T19:04:06.740Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T23:24:54.276Z","closed_at":"2019-04-22T22:57:23.309Z","closed_by":{"id":64248,"username":"stanhu","name":"Stan Hu","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/64248/stanhu.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stanhu"},"labels":["IncidentReview","auto updated"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":367626,"username":"alejandro","name":"Alejandro Rodríguez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/367626/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alejandro"},{"id":528408,"username":"asandov","name":"AnthonySandoval","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/528408/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/asandov"}],"author":{"id":528408,"username":"asandov","name":"AnthonySandoval","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/528408/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/asandov"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":367626,"username":"alejandro","name":"Alejandro Rodríguez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/367626/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/alejandro"},"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6405","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6405","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6405/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6405/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6405","relative":"#6405","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#6405"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":19227312,"iid":6401,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Improve PostgreSQL configuration files","description":"Presently the Chef recipes result in two files being placed in /var/opt/gitlab/postgresql:\n1.  postgresql.base.conf - this appears to be more or less a default configuration file, from the version 9.2 (or earlier) distribution, as it contains commented parameters that were removed in later releases.  It also lacks many of the newer settings, and is full of comment noise and is frankly a mess that's difficult to read.\n2.  postgresql.conf - this is Patroni's overrides to the base configuration, for variables that Patroni needs to be able to control.  It includes the previous file and then overrides/adds to that configuration.\n\nThere are also some effective settings that don't match either of these files or the default settings, which is confusing.\n\nI would like the configuration files to be clear, correct for the current PostgreSQL version, have all settings explicitly defined, and be written to match the order in the documentation.  Chef templating should be able to handle this fairly easily.  Ideally our Chef recipes would not be hardcoded to use a specific version either, but instead set a default major version that can be overridden.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-18T16:45:38.962Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T12:31:28.474Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T12:31:28.431Z","closed_by":{"id":2759709,"username":"Finotto","name":"Jose Finotto","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2759709/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/Finotto"},"labels":["Database","auto updated"],"milestone":{"id":989400,"iid":38,"group_id":1112072,"title":"Database September part 1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-03T10:14:40.685Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T16:21:15.363Z","due_date":"2019-09-13","start_date":"2019-09-02","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/milestones/38"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1243277,"username":"ghost1","name":"Ghost User","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4249f4df72b475e7894fabed1c5888cf?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ghost1"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6401","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6401","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6401/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6401/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6401","relative":"#6401","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#6401"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":19205575,"iid":6398,"project_id":1304532,"title":"HAProxy alerts should fire based on error-rate rather than static value","description":"From: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6397, we would like to alert based on error-rate rather than per-second average rate of increase of total errors. Alerts in the scope of this work: \n\n1. IncreasedBackendConnectionErrors \u003cbr/\u003e\n`rate(haproxy_backend_connection_errors_total[1m]) \u003e .1`. What this means is that 0.1 * 60 = 6 error is enough to trigger this alert regardless of the total connections (which might also increase over time)\n1. IncreasedServerConnectionErrors \u003cbr/\u003e\n`rate(haproxy_server_response_errors_total[1m]) \u003e .5`. Here it means 0.5 * 60 = 30 error is enough to trigger this alert. \n1. IncreasedServerResponseErrors \u003cbr/\u003e\n`rate(haproxy_server_connection_errors_total[1m]) \u003e .1`. Here, it is also 6 errors. \n\nThe proposal here is to calculate the above based on error-rate where we calculate it as: `error count` / `total count`. For example, for the `IncreasedServerResponseErrors` and `api_rate_limit` backend we could do: \n\n`sum(rate(haproxy_server_response_errors_total{backend=\"api_rate_limit\"}[1m]) * 60) / sum(rate(haproxy_server_http_responses_total{backend=\"api_rate_limit\"}[1m]) * 60)`\n\nWe will then have to set a threshold of error rate. The highest number of requests `api_rate_limit` processed in the last 2 weeks was around 1600 requests per min (ref: https://prometheus.gprd.gitlab.net/graph?g0.range_input=1w\u0026g0.expr=sum(rate(haproxy_server_http_responses_total%7Bbackend%3D%22api_rate_limit%22%7D%5B1m%5D))%20by%20(backend)\u0026g0.tab=0). The current threshold of `\u003e .1` would mean that 6 errors out of 1600 requests would be enough to trigger the alert and page us.

file metadata for packagecloud","description":"## Summary\n\nIn packagecloud 2.0.5, they've added the ability to permanently disable the repo file list metadata, resulting in far fewer rows being added to the files tables, and kicking off a background job to cleanup the existing files rows for the repo you turn it on for. See https://packagecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENTERPRISE/pages/465076277/RPM+and+Debian+file+list+metadata for details on the new feature.\n\n## Background\n\nPackagecloud by default keeps track of every file within a package is a new role in one of it's files tables in the database, and uses this information to generate repo file list metadata files. Due to number of files in our omnibus package, the size of these tables is large, and is impacting our ability to backup the database. In prior versions of packagecloud we have turned off the metadata file generation, but this does not change the number of rows added to the database.\n\n\n## Additional Info\n\nThis is some related information we recently got from our contact at packagecloud regarding turning off these files:\n\n\u003e Once you enable this setting, it will kick off a job that will delete all the unnecessary files rows in the database (this job will likely take a few days to run, but nothing will be locked in the process). Note: As the name suggests, this is a *permanent* setting, once filelists are disabled permanently, they can't be re-enabled. \n\n\u003e (Optional) After doing the above and ensuring all of the DeleteFilesJob jobs are finished (you can see job progress in the indexer status section of the administrator dashboard) you can now run 'OPTIMIZE TABLE deb_files;' and 'OPTIMIZE TABLE rpm_files;' to significantly reduce disk space used and the size of your database backups.\n\n\n## Actions\n\n- [x] Permanent disable metadata for `gitlab/pre-release` (~ 10000 packages)\n  * [x] DeleteFilesJob complete\n- [x] Permanent disable metadata for `gitlab/nightly-builds` (~ 30000 packages)\n  * [x] DeleteFilesJob complete\n- [x] Permanent disable metadata for `gitlab/raspberry-pi2` (~ 1000 packages)\n  * [x] DeleteFilesJob complete\n- [x] Permanent disable metadata for `gitlab/unstable` (~ 6000 packages)\n  * [x] DeleteFilesJob complete\n- [x] Permanent disable metadata for `gitlab/gitlab-ee` (~ 5000 packages)\n  * [x] DeleteFilesJob complete\n- [x] Permanent disable metadata for `gitlab/gitlab-ce` (~ 5000 packages)\n  * [x] DeleteFilesJob complete \n- [x] Run `OPTIMIZE TABLE deb_files;` (note table will be locked, uploads will be blocked)\n- [x] Run `OPTIMIZE TABLE rpm_files;` (note table will be locked, uploads will be blocked)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-06T16:27:14.065Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T19:41:33.066Z","closed_at":"2019-03-10T01:47:40.644Z","closed_by":{"id":429540,"username":"ahanselka","name":"Alex

PaaS](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/111). We'd like to create a dedicated project on GCP so that we can:\n\n1. Enable GCP alpha features, namely [GKE Sandbox](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/digging-into-kubernetes-1-12)\n1. Ensure we have IP space available (currently all other projects run out of IP space often, this would block us)\n1. Analyze cost easily without having to filter resources out of existing projects\n\nWe only require that the project have billing enabled and have a recognizable name, such as `gitlab-paas`.\n\nAlso, if possible, it would be great to limit access to this project to members of the configure team (perhaps just for resource creation).\n\n```\ntkuah\ndgriffith\njfargher\ntwatson\ndgruesso\ntdavis\nmcabrera\nddavison\njcunha\njerasmus\ngbizon\nmgreiling\n```\n\nThank

Loss of db metrics visibility by switching to dedicated prometheus instance for db metrics","description":"## Summary\n\nBy starting to scrape db metrics from a new dedicated prometheus instance our grafana db dashboards stopped working.\n\nService(s) affected : ~\"Service:Postgres\"\n\nTeam attribution : Infrastructure\n\nMinutes downtime or degradation : 21h\n\n## Impact \u0026 Metrics\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- What was the impact of the incident?\n  - We lost visibility into db metrics for a while (although metrics were still scraped, but by another instance, which wasn't noticed)\n- Who was impacted by this incident?\n  - SRE oncall, release team - having to delay the 11.8 release by an hour.\n- How did the incident impact customers?\n  - no customer impact\n\n## Detection \u0026 Response\n\nStart with the following:\n\n- How was the incident detected?\n  - we got alerts for missing metrics\n- Did alarming work as expected?\n  - we got some alerts for missing metrics data, but not specific enough to immediately be aware of what was going on.\n- How long did it take from the start of the incident to its detection?\n  - 12h\n- How long did it take from detection to remediation?\n  - 9h\n- Were there any issues with the response to the incident? (i.e. bastion host used to access the service was not available, relevant team memeber wasn't page-able, ...)\n  - we should have noticed earlier from the alerts that db monitoring wasn't working anymore\n  - paging for DBRE support didn't work as DBRE schedules were not communicated clear enough and escalation was still going to OnGres (which doesn't support us anymore)\n\n## Timeline\n\n2019-02-21\n\n- 17:35 UTC - general-alerts: `Operation rate data for the \"service\" component of the \"patroni\" service is missing`\n\n2019-02-22\n\n- 05:29 UTC - @andrewn raising concern about above alert\n- 12:34 UTC - incident issue created (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/issues/697)\n- 12:58 UTC - DBRE oncall was paged, team starts fixing Grafana dashboards\n- 13:24 UTC - release team wants to deploy 11.8, SRE oncall is holding them off to first get db metrics visibility again\n- 14:29 UTC - SRE oncall gives green light for 11.8 deploy\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\ngeneral db alerts didn't get data anymore.\nBecause db dashboards in grafana didn't work anymore.\nBecause prometheus-gprd wasn't scraping db data anymore.\nBecause a change was made to scrape them from a new, dedicated instance, prometheus-db.\nBecause db metrics were making up most of the load on prometheus-gprd.\n\n## What went well\n\n- general-alerts warning for missing db metrics data\n- @andrewn noticing the alerts and taking action, making team aware of the consequences and creating an incident\n- @ahmadsherif and @yguo jumping in to adjust the dashboards\n\n## What can be improved\n\n- Better communication to make everybody aware of changes in monitoring\n- Making sure that dashboards and alerts are still working when changing prometheus setup\n- Better response to alerts that are not fully understood (as the missing metrics alert)\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n- Fix Grafana Dashboards https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6266\n- Check if we still get all the db metrics and alerts via prometheus-db: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/6271\n- Communicate the new prometheus-db instance","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-22T18:34:05.741Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T12:31:37.210Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T12:00:54.858Z","closed_by":{"id":3059703,"username":"hphilipps","name":"Henri

When for small tasks (as new index idea verification) a smaller instance is usually enough, it is not so if we need to test something bigger (as background migration processing ~100M-1B rows). In such cases we need a 32-core machine, since it gives better disk performance (see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance).\n\nThe same project is also constantly being used for automated backup verification.\n\nAdditionally, I just raised the default disk space for 'grpd' type of instances there from 3000Gib to 3300GiB, since GitLab.com is growing and the old size was not enough.\n\nPlease raise quotas. If possible, double them.\n\n@Finotto \n\ncc @abrandl @northrup @yguo","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-21T16:16:25.507Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T19:39:19.967Z","closed_at":"2019-02-25T00:29:38.095Z","closed_by":{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"},"labels":["Database","auto updated","unscheduled"],"milestone":{"id":771652,"iid":68,"project_id":1304532,"title":"DS team 2019 Week 7","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-26T19:49:39.859Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T00:41:02.529Z","due_date":"2019-02-24","start_date":"2019-02-11","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"}],"author":{"id":1906296,"username":"NikolayS","name":"Nikolay Samokhvalov","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1906296/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/NikolayS"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2222520,"username":"dawsmith","name":"Dave Smith","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef341e061f6b86461626e64c5fbcfe52?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dawsmith"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6260","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6260","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6260/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6260/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6260","relative":"#6260","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#6260"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":18460105,"iid":6257,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Make automatic terraform module versioning mandatory, or remove it","description":"So this has tripped me up several times now, and I know it’s tripped up a few others as well.  The new automatic versioning for the terraform modules requires `fix` or `feat` in the MR name or it breaks and you have to manually tag it.  This is just too easy to mess up, since this is not required across the board, and many of these changes are so small and infrequent that I foresee it being a long time before I get used to doing it right.  That means a lot more messed up merges ahead.\n\nI propose either making it impossible to merge an MR with no prefix, or removing the automated pipeline and making manual tagging the standard.\n\nIf the merge button didn't appear unless the pipeline found a prefix in the title, that would be ideal.  Then we could use `something:` as the prefix if we didn't want a version bump.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-21T01:55:29.473Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T20:08:17.408Z","closed_at":"2019-12-06T15:40:34.425Z","closed_by":{"id":528408,"username":"asandov","name":"AnthonySandoval","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/528408/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/asandov"},"labels":["team::Reliability","terraform","workflow-infra::Cancelled"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2336046,"username":"devin","name":"Devin Sylva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/424b025122218e9a586245e301c1c725?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/devin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability/-/issues/6257","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6257","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6257/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532/issues/6257/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/1304532","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6257","relative":"#6257","full":"gitlab-com/gl-infra/reliability#6257"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":18459505,"iid":6256,"project_id":1304532,"title":"Reduce used space on `file-21`","description":"`file-21` is at 83% usage and the last one left over 80%.
