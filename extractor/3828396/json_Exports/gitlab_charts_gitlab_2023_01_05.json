[{"id":121256396,"iid":4097,"project_id":3828396,"title":"Add deprecation note to GitLab deprecations regarding KAS private tls","description":"### What is this issue about?\n\nThe `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.enabled` and `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.secretName` attrs were deprecated following the linked discussion below.\n\nThe following discussion from !2888 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @Alexand started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2888#note_1220328090): \n\n    \u003e I'm not sure if deprecating `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.*` is the best way forward. But my reasoning was:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e 1. I want to simplify the chart options. So it's probably better to have just one documentation section explaining how to enable TLS for KAS.\n    \u003e 1. Having a global attribute to configure TLS for KAS across the chart gives us more power to automate these configurations. Right now, GitLab webservice needs KAS address (`grpc` vs `grpcs`). A configuration value that lives inside of the KAS sub-chart can't do it.\n    \u003e 1. I can't immediately think of a reason why one would want to enable just certain KAS servers with TLS, but not others.\n    \u003e 1. I don't think we'd need different certificates per KAS server, or any other TLS specific configuration that would be used differently for each KAS service.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e _I'm leaving this thread open in case reviewer and maintainer have any thoughts regarding this._\n\nThis issue is to track adding a deprecation note to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html.\n\n### Deprecation note proposal\n\nPlanned removal: GitLab 17.0 (2024-05-22)\n\nThe GitLab chart provides `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.enabled` and `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.secretName` to support TLS communication between KAS pods. To enable TLS communication between KAS and all other chart components that KAS needs to communicate to, one needs to set many other extra Helm values.\n\nTo facilitate enabling TLS communication between KAS and all the chart components, we've introduced the `global.kas.tls.*` Helm values. Since this is a more complete and simple approach to enabling TLS for KAS. We recommend you stop using `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.*` Helm values, and use `global.kas.tls.*` instead. Therefore, the `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.*` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in 17.0. For more information please refer to:\n\n- The [Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2888) which introduces the `global.kas.tls.*` values.\n- The [deprecated documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/kas/index.html#enable-tls-communication).\n- The new preferred documentation.

See https://about.gitlab.com/support/\n--\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nWe introduced support for running Action Cable in embedded mode in Omnibus https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/4407. It can be enabled by setting the `ACTION_CABLE_IN_APP` environment variable. This was enabled in docker-compose in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/-/merge_requests/504.\n\nWe need to expose this environment variable via the Helm chart so that it can be set on `webservice` pods when deployed via K8s.\n\nWe should also support setting the `ACTION_CABLE_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` environment variable. Both are non-secret.\n\nWe've also created a [container](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/-/tree/master/gitlab-actioncable) specifically for running Action Cable in a standalone Puma server so it can be scaled independently. This is probably what will be used on gitlab.com and Helm chart work towards that is being tracked in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2284.\n\nSee also: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2043\n\n## Detail\n\n#### In Omnibus\n\n- Action Cable is disabled by default;\n- Action Cable is enabled in Omnibus using the `actioncable['enabled']` setting;\n- By default, a separate Action Cable server is started that only serves WebSocket connections. To run it in embedded mode, as part of the same Puma server, the `actioncable['in_app']` setting is used, and\n- Action Cable thread pool size is configured with the `actioncable['worker_pool_size']`.\n\n#### In CNG\n\n- A separate `actioncable` container exists, which can be scaled independently;\n- Action Cable can be run in embedded mode on the `webservice` container by passing in the `ACTION_CABLE_IN_APP` envvar;\n- Max AC thread pool size is configured with the `ACTION_CABLE_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` environment variable, and\n- Workhorse accepts a `cableBackend` argument which accepts a service name and port and can proxy WebSocket requests to the correct service. It defaults to the same as the `authBackend` setting.\n\nAn example of a setup proxying requests to a `webservice` container running embedded Action Cable is in the CNG [docker-compose.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/-/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.\n\nCurrently, Action Cable is only supported for the Puma server, not Unicorn.\n\n## Proposal\n\nModify GitLab Helm chart to allow configuration of Action Cable in embedded mode.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-03T10:25:59.187Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T17:10:02.686Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T15:10:57.945Z","closed_by":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John
