to use duplicity on folders containing the word open.\n\nIt looks like the client is cutting of everything from open on:\n\nDoes not work:\nsftp command: 'mkdir \"open@example.com\"'\nState = sftp, Before = 'mkdir \"' \u003c- folder name is missing\n\nWorks:\nsftp command: 'mkdir \"foo@example.com\"'\nState = sftp, Before = 'mkdir \"foo@example.com\" \u003c- folder name is here\n\nDoes not work:\nsftp command: 'mkdir \"foopenbar@example.com\"'\nState = sftp, Before = 'mkdir \"fo' \u003c- folder name is only partially\npresent.\n\nIt does also not work on a folder just called fooopenbar or simply open.\n\nFull debug runs attached.\n\n1st does not work\n2nd works\n3rd does not work\n\nThis started to appear after upgrading from 0.6.11 to 0.6.17.\n\nOther folders, not containing the

Verify: Invalid data - SHA1 hash mismatch : ErrorReturnCode=21 (lp:#930866)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/930866) created by **Rodrigo Alvarez (rodrigo-alvarez-i)**\n```\nShort story:\n\nWhen I run duplicity in verify mode on a given set, it sometimes passes,\nand it sometimes fails with reporting:\nInvalid data - SHA1 hash mismatch for file:\n SOME_VOLUME.difftar.gpg\n Calculated hash: SOME_HASH\n Manifest hash: ANOTHER_HASH\n\nIf I run it again, SOME_VOLUME gets through and ANOTHER_VOLUME reports the\nerror.   If I restart the server, then verify passes (sometimes).\n\nYes, the Hard drive where the volumes are stored is healthy (as reported by\nSMART) and when diff(ed) with its off-site mirror reports no differences.\n\nThe details:\nI have several backup sets {Projects, Documents, Code, etc...} on Ubuntu\n10.04 which I backup with duplicity 0.6.17 to an internal hard drive--the\nprimary backup target.\n\nOnce a month I run duplicity in verify mode to make sure that my primary\nbackup is still a backup.  This month two sets failed.  This was not a\nproblem as have an offsite mirror that was synced 15 days ago.   I ran\n`diff primary_backup mirror_backup` and the supposedly corrupt volumes were\nidentical; as expected, the only differences where the backup volumes\ngenerated during the last 15 days.  Weird, right?   So I run duplicity\nverify on the primary_target and another volume-deeper in the set-reports a\nhash mismatch.  Weirder, right? Now i run duplicity verify on the mirror:\nit passes.\n\nSomehow my primary backup got messes up, right? I clobber it and replace it\nwith its older mirror and run duplicity verify to make sure all is good.\nIt fails, the primary_backup fails.  I run another `diff primary_backup\nmirror_backup` and now they are identical.  Ok, the drive that stores the\nprimary_backup is failing, but wait: SMART long test says it is perfectly\nhealthy and has no bad blocks or read/write errors in its entire history (I\nrun these once a week).   I delete duplicity cache, and temp files and\nrerun duplicity verify on primary_target and it fails: a new volume with\nbad hash.  Now I go brute force and run duplicity verify 10 times and each\ntime a different volume shows a bad hash. Sometime volume 3, somtimes\nvolume 1000.   What?\n\nI now reboot the server--a few days have gone by and I've spent about 5 hrs\nlooking at this--and I run duplicity verify on the primary_backup and it\npassess.   What? This is the exact data that had failed 10 times?\nSeriously?   Nevermind, this is what I expected and how things should be.\nJust to make sure all is good I rerun duplicity verify on all my sets and\nwait.   What? Now two new sets report errors but the ones that originaly\nreported errors are fine.\n\nHelp!  Can we trust verify?   Why does it fail sometime and pass other\ntimes?   Can it be the hard drive even if diff  and SMART pass? Is there a\nbug in duplicity or gpg?\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2012-02-12T06:13:13.010Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T16:40:05.310Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T15:42:03.428Z","closed_by":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"labels":["priority::medium","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/duplicity/duplicity/-/issues/268","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":22,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/268","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/268/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/268/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#268","relative":"#268","full":"duplicity/duplicity#268"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118022589,"iid":655,"project_id":12450835,"title":"tmp directory was removed before duplicity was finished with it (lp:#922101)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/922101) created by **sirhc (sirhc808)**\n```\nOn Thu, Jan 26, 2012 at 8:04 AM, sirhc808@gmail.com \u003csirhc808@gmail.com\u003e\nwrote:\nHello - I'm new to Duplicity and I'm likely making a user error, however\nI've been unable to find a path around this issue.

Some of those early sets rarely\nchange, but even if nothing changes, Duplicity uploads a new incremental\nset of files.  This not only wastes time when backing up, but it causes a\nLOT of time to be wasted when doing a restore.\n\nFor example, a few days ago I needed to restore three small files from a\nsmall backup set that hadn't changed in years.  But to do so, Duplicity had\nto download probably over a hundred incremental sets in which nothing\nchanged.  This took a LONG time!  It's especially slow since, judging from\nDuplicity's verbose output, it downloads one file at a time--the latency\nbetween commands adds up quickly (I'm ignorant about SFTP: is there no way\nto request more than one file at a time?).  Restoring less than 20 KB of\ndata took over 10 minutes because of all the empty incremental sets that\nhad to be downloaded.\n\nI realize that it's important to indicate when incremental backups were\nmade, even if nothing changed, so I think Duplicity should store empty\nincremental sets in a different way.  For example, it could store a single\nfile in the remote directory that lists all the times incremental backups\nwere made in which nothing changed.  When making a new, unchanged\nincremental backup, Duplicity could simply append the date and time to the\nfile and replace the copy on the server.  This would save so much time it's\nnot even funny!  :)\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2011-04-21T17:38:16.174Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T15:54:47.599Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T15:54:47.577Z","closed_by":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth

This is on\nLinux Ubuntu maverick x86_64; I cannot reproduce it on 32-bit x86.  I've\nattached a log with the error message.\n\nThis is Duplicity 0.6.13, using the ubuntu package\n0.6.13-0ubuntu1~maverick1.  Python is 2.6.6, using the ubuntu package\n2.6.6-2ubuntu2.  The filesystem is ext4.\n\nIt seems this happens when the device file's st_rdev exceeds 2^31.  The\nmajor and minor numbers are packed into this field in a funny way so it\ntakes a little thought to see how to reproduce this.  The encoding goes as\nfollows: the 32 bits of st_rdev from high to low are:\n\nMIN[19:8] MAJ[11:0] MIN[7:0]\n\n(Actually it looks like st_rdev is really 64 bits, encoded as MAJ[31:12]\nMIN[31:8] MAJ[11:0] MIN[7:0], but it is not currently possible to create a\ndevice with the high 32 bits nonzero.)\n\nSo we have a 12-bit major number and a 20-bit minor number.  It appears\nduplicity fails when bit 20 of the minor number is set.  E.g. 'mknod foo c\n0xfff 0xfffff' or 'mknod foo c 0x000 0x80000'.\n\nUsing the --exclude-device-files options does NOT prevent duplicity from\nfailing.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2011-04-09T15:08:09.813Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T15:54:25.355Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T15:54:25.339Z","closed_by":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::new"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/duplicity/duplicity/-/issues/353","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/353","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/353/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/353/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#353","relative":"#353","full":"duplicity/duplicity#353"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118019700,"iid":352,"project_id":12450835,"title":"Child processes go defunct (lp:#755545)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/755545) created by **Wladimir J. van der Laan (laanwj)**\n```\nI'm doing a verify of a fairly large remote backup and see this in the\nprocess list.

page describing the tar replacement format asks for ideas to\nimprove error recovery.  Here is an important one that I learned from\ndesigning a file system that has no critical blocks (can survive corruption\nor loss anywhere with limited data loss).  Each file (including meta files\nsuch as index data) should be assigned an \"id\" within the backup.  The\nblock header for each block should include the file id, and perhaps an\noffset within the file.  This way, even with loss of meta data, blocks\nbelonging to the same file can be identified, and files still recovered in\na \"lost+found\" directory.   The pointers in the index are not sufficient,\nbecause you often don't know how many bytes have been \"skipped\" when\nrecovering from errors.  (And you may not have the index.)\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2011-02-06T21:58:54.467Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T15:53:43.061Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T15:53:43.039Z","closed_by":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::new"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/duplicity/duplicity/-/issues/343","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/343","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/343/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/343/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#343","relative":"#343","full":"duplicity/duplicity#343"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118019645,"iid":342,"project_id":12450835,"title":"Backup on a webdav server fails with \"SSLError: The read operation timed out\" (lp:#714175)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/714175) created by **Lutz Niggl (lutz-niggl)**\n```\nVersion 6.11\nPython 2.7\nSuse 11.3\nwebdavs backend\n\nBacking up to webdav.mediencenter.t-online.de\n\nError \"SSLError: The read operation timed out\" repeatedly shows up after\nsome 10-30MB.

For example, using SSH to make a\nremote backup of an entire system requires that the SSH daemon allow root\nlogin, which is considered a security risk. Using the rsync daemon allows\nfor root login via SSH to be disabled.\"\nSo, I presumed I need to use duplicity through rsync backend and also use\ngpg encryption to encrypt my backup files.\n\nFor security reasons I cannot pass any of my passwords by arguments in\ncommand line to duplicity.\nIn the gpg-key case I need to create a gpg key and use --gpg-options '--\npassphrase-file=${GPG_KEY}'.\n\nBut I need to make a similar procedure to rsync. So, I have password saved\nin a file. The rsync utility provides the option --password-file to inform\nthe password saved in a file.\nSo, the following command will synchronize using rsync (/etc/password\ncontains the password):\nrsync -avz --password-file /etc/rsyncd.password /backup/\nuser@backup_server::backup_module/etc\n\nThen I need to pass the --password-file option to rsync backend in a\ncommand such as the following:\nduplicity  --gpg-options '--passphrase-file=${GPG_KEY}' --rsync-options '--\npassword-file /etc/rsyncd.password' /etc\nrsync://user@backup_server::backup_module/etc\n\nWhat is the correct way to do this?\nIs there any other way to achieve my needs?\n\nBest,\nOrair.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2010-06-30T21:08:31.863Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T16:40:10.565Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T15:51:27.915Z","closed_by":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::new"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2708575,"username":"AlphaPrime","name":"Kenneth Loafman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6fba0169484daeff7768831fd18acd9?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AlphaPrime"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/duplicity/duplicity/-/issues/323","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/323","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/323/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835/issues/323/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12450835","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#323","relative":"#323","full":"duplicity/duplicity#323"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118019484,"iid":322,"project_id":12450835,"title":"Some translations not installed (lp:#595974)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/595974) created by **Gabor Karsay (gabor-karsay)**\n```\nSome translations are not installed, although they are translatable in\nlaunchpad or there are po-files for them.
