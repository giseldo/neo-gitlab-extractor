Can we keep the history of access requests/grants in the auditlog? \n1. This will either be  breaking change or we need to add if/else to most calls concerning access request/grants. If we decide to make this a breaking change it will only affect setups were the consumer and provider use a different version of NLX. This has been discussed during our review. Conduction was the only stakeholder with active NLX installations. Their response: Mag een breaking change zijn, dan is het duidelijk voor iedereen.\nAlleen last van voor demodam,  maar dat cluster ligt er momenteel uit, dus momenteel geen last van. Als het weer up gaat, dan zal Robert updates moeten doorvoeren.\n\n1. Should requests between NLX components contain the version of the component? This information could be used to give our users more specific error messages.\n \n\n**:link: Reference links**","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-18T08:14:35.799Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T19:57:44.485Z","closed_at":"2022-03-17T19:57:44.459Z","closed_by":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":2519809,"iid":36,"group_id":4921998,"title":"73 helping Utrecht deploying NLX","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-16T10:39:36.702Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T12:13:30.397Z","due_date":"2022-03-30","start_date":"2022-03-16","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/nlx/-/milestones/36"},"assignees":[{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},{"id":1700884,"username":"RonaldKoster","name":"Ronald Koster","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1700884/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/RonaldKoster"},{"id":3013866,"username":"HenkVanMaanen","name":"Henk van Maanen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3013866/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/HenkVanMaanen"}],"author":{"id":1700884,"username":"RonaldKoster","name":"Ronald Koster","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1700884/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/RonaldKoster"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/1427","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":21,"completed_count":19},"weight":21,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1427","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1427/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1427/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1427","relative":"#1427","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#1427"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":12,"epic":{"id":78926,"iid":12,"title":"Manage access to services","url":"/groups/commonground/nlx/-/epics/12","group_id":4921998},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97356866,"iid":1420,"project_id":7128869,"title":"The organization owning the outway must be able to revoke access","description":"It is not possible for a consumer to 'quit' or 'cancel' and ongoing access request. This potentially result in unnecessary activities (time spend by the owner of the service to assess the request) and when something is wrong at the owner side (the Inway) an access request with an error state will exists indefinitely (or at least until the owner fixes its problem). In order to have control over the access requests, it's necessary to be able to delete an request. Since you might delete a request which was actually already granted by the owner (the consumer just doesn't know that yet), it must also be possible to then cancel access from the consumer side of things. And if that's an option, then we just as easily can add that functionality to the UI making it explicitly possible.\n\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Add two buttons\n    - one for cancelling access as a consumer (when you already had access)\n       - must result in removing the access grant and maybe the proof -\u003e figure it out\n       - showing the correct status for the access of the specific outway -\u003e back to no access again with the messages/status access cancelled by 'Ingetrokken door [user]' including time stamp\n       - adding an audit log entry at the consumer side \n       - add the request access button\n\n    - one for canceling an access request as a consumer\n       - The cancelling access request button is only visible when at the supplier side the access is not granted (could be that the revoke action hasn't synchronized yet)\n       - remove the access request on both sides\n       - add audit record \n       - the status of the access of the specific outway must be No access including 'geannuleerd door [user]' and a timestamp\n       - add the request access button\n\n- Add end to end tests\n- Check and update documentation when necessary\n\nTODO:\n\n- [x] Make split in audit log between action start and action end\n- [x] Add database integration tests\n- [x] Update Management UI\n- [x] Update Inway\n- [ ] Syncer moet approved access state niet opniuew updaten\n- [x] Sequence diagram\n- [ ] Check if there are changes to convert GORM to sqlc","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-15T13:58:25.806Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T15:47:46.786Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T09:31:40.706Z","closed_by":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":2846245,"iid":50,"group_id":4921998,"title":"87 - The standard","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-26T09:09:57.415Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:38:53.730Z","due_date":"2022-11-09","start_date":"2022-10-26","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/nlx/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},{"id":1700884,"username":"RonaldKoster","name":"Ronald Koster","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1700884/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/RonaldKoster"}],"author":{"id":1211025,"username":"evangelderen","name":"Edward","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1211025/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/evangelderen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/1420","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":5},"weight":13,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1420","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1420/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1420/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1420","relative":"#1420","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#1420"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":12,"epic":{"id":78926,"iid":12,"title":"Manage access to services","url":"/groups/commonground/nlx/-/epics/12","group_id":4921998},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97347326,"iid":1419,"project_id":7128869,"title":"Add serialnumber to CSR","description":"As a NLX demo user\nI want to be able to add the subject serialnumber to my CSR\nSo that I am able to predict my URL's\n\nAcceptation Criteria \n- [x] Add instructions on how to add a subject serial number in the docs\n- [x] Add instructions on how to add subject serial number to an existing CSR\n- [ ] Communicate this change to team Haven\n- [x] The certportal should use the subject serial number in the CSR.

This must be discussed first.\n\nConclusion: revoking incoming orders should not be possible, that's out of scope for now\n\n\n![_todo__Opdrachten_-_Details_Copy_2](/uploads/1b4ba906864a8abe4cbf38eacdeb9e0c/_todo__Opdrachten_-_Details_Copy_2.png)\n\n![_todo__Opdrachten_-_Ontvangen_Copy](/uploads/2ec5297e818395b1a3a446dda1dcbe3d/_todo__Opdrachten_-_Ontvangen_Copy.png)\n\n\n\n**:desktop_computer: How to demonstrate / e2e test(s):**\n\n1.\n\n**:white\\_check\\_mark: Acceptance criteria**\n\n1. update the sequence diagram (as seen in the epic)\n\n**:link: Reference links**","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-02T08:16:10.781Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T10:10:09.748Z","closed_at":"2021-08-25T14:19:35.624Z","closed_by":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":2192393,"iid":23,"group_id":4921998,"title":"060 - easy helm install and easy service management","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-18T11:06:24.509Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T12:39:40.627Z","due_date":"2021-09-01","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/nlx/-/milestones/23"},"assignees":[{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},{"id":3013866,"username":"HenkVanMaanen","name":"Henk van Maanen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3013866/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/HenkVanMaanen"}],"author":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/1181","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":13,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1181","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1181/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1181/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1181","relative":"#1181","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#1181"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":14,"epic":{"id":115921,"iid":14,"title":"MVP Manage delegated access to services","url":"/groups/commonground/nlx/-/epics/14","group_id":4921998,"human_readable_end_date":"Aug 4, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":80061764,"iid":1180,"project_id":7128869,"title":"Grant delegation to a supplier","description":"**As a** municipality\n\u003cbr\u003e**I want** to be able to allow suppliers to access services on my behalf\n\u003cbr\u003e**so** that I do not need to share my private key\n\n**:desktop_computer: How to demonstrate / e2e test(s):**\n\n1.

This results in a untagged version of the `docker-compose.management.yml` file. That file contains Docker images with the tag latest.\n\n\n## Problem\n\nThe problem with this is that the settings in `docker-compose.management.yml` can mismatch with what the `latest` Docker tag points to (at the moment of cloning and pulling).\n\nAlso the user needs to clone the whole code base for a single file to run a demo.\n\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nUse a dedicated git repository for this demo and version Docker tags instead of `latest`.\n\n- [x] Move docker-compose.management.yml to new repo 'nlx-try-me'\n- [x] Add DEX config\n- [x] Create demo PKI\n- [x] Alter 'getting up and running'  section of docs.nlx.io\n- [x] Make sure it is clear at every step this is just meant to get to know NLX, NOT FOR PRODUCTION\n- [x] Add renovate bot for auto updating of docker-compose\n- [x]
