We need it to be there to display the right data, but it makes it difficult to show the state of the **new** access request.\n\nWe cannot compare the `revokedAt` date with the `createdAt` date of the new access request, because these dates are created by different clocks (systems).\n\n- [ ] Therefore (and maybe other reasons) we need to set a `accessRequestId` prop on the `accessProof` object.\n- [ ] Then we can update the frontend (`directoryServiceAccessState`) to show the correct things on screen.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-14T10:56:24.415Z","updated_at":"2020-11-24T07:55:37.509Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T13:36:52.876Z","closed_by":{"id":4380986,"username":"dillendev","name":"Dillen Meijboom","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4380986/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dillendev"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":1682502,"iid":7,"group_id":4921998,"title":"043 - NLX Quality of Life  \u0026 onboarding Amsterdam","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-19T15:20:42.247Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T12:47:33.418Z","due_date":"2020-11-25","start_date":"2020-10-28","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/nlx/-/milestones/7"},"assignees":[{"id":4380986,"username":"dillendev","name":"Dillen Meijboom","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4380986/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dillendev"}],"author":{"id":2478534,"username":"ehotting","name":"Eelco","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2478534/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ehotting"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4380986,"username":"dillendev","name":"Dillen Meijboom","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4380986/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dillendev"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/1043","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1043","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1043/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/1043/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1043","relative":"#1043","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#1043"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72634647,"iid":1041,"project_id":7128869,"title":"Set the new 'permissions' policy header","description":"**As a** sysadmin\n\u003cbr\u003e**I want** the NLX frontend to have complete security headers\n\u003cbr\u003e**so** that our hygiene is tip top\n\nSet the 'permissions' header in all our frontends.\nMore important for public frontends than the Management UI\n\nWe do not allow anything.

Currently the https endpoint serves the (PKIO) organization certificate to the client. The problem with this is that the organization certificate should contain the internal domain name on which the outway is reachable. Besides this certificate is used for authenticating the outway on the NLX network.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nUse separate certificate for the https endpoint. This should be explicit be configured, no fallback to the organization certificate. If it is desired to use the same certificate then this needs to be configured twice.\r\n\r\n## Focus\r\nThis issue has a focus on the changes of the connection between the client and the outway. other issue's should address other points of the to-be situation for the outway\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria / technical \r\n\r\n* Add certificate bundle (certificate, private key, ca certificate) options to `nlx-outway`\r\n* Validate as usual\r\n* Use certificate bundle to start the https server\r\n* Start HTTPs server only when certificate bundle is provided, including CA certificate\r\n* CA certificate is required\r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n* Options: https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/blob/master/outway/cmd/nlx-outway/main.go#L24\r\n* HTTPs server: https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/blob/master/outway/listen.go#L58-63\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes for the to-be situation\r\n1. use the .local address https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local\r\n2. relocate the state of the Outway to the NLX Management component\r\n3. add local certificates and keypairs\r\n4. remove the \"DISABLE_LOGDB\" flagg and define the NLX_LOG_ADDRESS \r\n -- when the adress is empty the logging should be disabled and the http headers should \r\ninclude a warning stating that Logging is disabled in the outway\r\n5. The client must inform the outway whitch organisation and service to adress. basically their are three options:\r\n 5.1 the client should add 2 headers that includes {organization-name}/{service-name}/ OR\r\n 5.2 the client should include the {organization-name}/{service-name} in the path OR\r\n 5.2 the client should include {organization-name}/{service-name} in the hostname\r\n\r\n### Considerations:\r\nif the response to the client includes a NLX domain consiting of https://nlx.{provider}.nl/ \r\nthe response should be altered to replace : \r\n-- https://nlx.{provider}.nl/{path} with \r\n-- https://{consumer}.local/{organization-name}/{service-name}/{path}\r\n\r\nhence making it possible to referens to a NLX resource in the response\r\n\r\nThe linked data issue should also be resolved for the outway to work as a proxy\r\nhence making it possible to referens to a NLX resource in the response\r\nthe linked data issue should also be resolved for the outway to work as a proxy\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/316\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/530\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/merge_requests/1337","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-08T09:31:35.371Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T07:36:24.747Z","closed_at":"2020-06-05T07:36:24.685Z","closed_by":{"id":534526,"username":"hugoboos","name":"Hugo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/534526/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hugoboos"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":1282607,"iid":44,"group_id":3094865,"title":"Sprint 36","description":"Inzicht in de inway via NLX management","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-14T10:05:35.486Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T10:27:09.925Z","due_date":"2020-06-09","start_date":"2020-05-27","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":534526,"username":"hugoboos","name":"Hugo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/534526/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hugoboos"}],"author":{"id":534526,"username":"hugoboos","name":"Hugo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/534526/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hugoboos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":534526,"username":"hugoboos","name":"Hugo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/534526/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/hugoboos"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/930","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/930","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/930/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/930/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#930","relative":"#930","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#930"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33312838,"iid":917,"project_id":7128869,"title":"Outways page","description":"**As a** administrator\n\u003cbr\u003e**I want** to have an overview of all the outways \n\u003cbr\u003e**so** that I can copy its Public Key PEM\n\n**:desktop_computer: How to demonstrate**\n\n1.

This is really easy, but also introduces a large attack vector as every trusted certificate that is handed out for an organization can automatically be used in the context of NLX.\n\nTo allow more granular authorizations, we would like to introduce authorizations based on the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field in the certificate. This has the following benefits:\n\n- This restricts the certificates from a particular organization that can be used to setup NLX connections.\n- This allows organizations to compartiment their security by having different security zones.\n- This protects the NLX system of compromised CA's by pinning to specific public keys of certificates.\n\nOf course this results in more administrative work by the inway administrator, but we can probably solve this partially by implementing good UX confirmation flows as described in #742. This could be a great follow-up story.\n\n**:white\\_check\\_mark: Acceptance criteria**\n\n1. The service-config.toml and config API are extended to support authorization based on public keys\n1. We describe authorization based on the public key as the preferred way of authorization in production in the docs\n1.
