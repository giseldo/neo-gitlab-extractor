This makes URLs in the context of NLX predictable.\n\n\n**:desktop_computer: How to demonstrate**\n\n1. Start an outway\n1. Set `HTTP_PROXY` env variable to the address of the outway\n1.

The outway forwards requests to hosts with the TLD `.services.nlx.local` to the specific service on NLX.\n1. `HTTP_PROXY` is used\n1. New feature is described in docs\n\n \n**:hammer\\_and\\_wrench: Possible technical solutions**\n\n**:question: Open questions**\n\n1. Do we want requests on NLX to be explicit (`*.*.nlx.local`)? Or should we allow internet-routable hostnames te be fetched over NLX implicitly through a SRV record in the public DNS (`*.org.nl`) as well? -\u003eYes we should allow internet-routable hostnames te be fetched over NLX as a follow up story\n1. Should we route non-NLX requests through the outway as well? Possible idea's:\n    - Yes, but with a log in the txlog\n    - Yes, but we should forward non-NLX requests to an organization proxy\n\n**:warning: Possible problems**\n\n1. Organization names with spaces and dots are not usable when we switch to a hostname, so we should introduce hostname-friendly slugs.\n\n**:link: Reference links**\n\n* PoC #508\n* WIP https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/merge_requests/376\n* WIP https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/draw-io/-/blob/master/concepts/OutwayProxySetup.drawio\n\n**:microphone: Request for feedback**\n\n* Joost (Kadaster)\n* @sergei-maertens \n\n**:hammer\\_and\\_wrench: Proposed sequence diagram**\n![OutwayProxySetup-Page-4](/uploads/11619c74167a5170eb2b6a3103067e41/OutwayProxySetup-Page-4.png)\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-27T10:31:18.142Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T16:08:26.806Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T15:21:54.567Z","closed_by":{"id":1700884,"username":"RonaldKoster","name":"Ronald Koster","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1700884/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/RonaldKoster"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":1220387,"iid":40,"group_id":3094865,"title":"Sprint 32","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-01T13:15:31.507Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T10:07:05.149Z","due_date":"2020-04-15","start_date":"2020-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/-/milestones/40"},"assignees":[{"id":1700884,"username":"RonaldKoster","name":"Ronald Koster","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1700884/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/RonaldKoster"}],"author":{"id":935804,"username":"ndequeker","name":"Niels","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/935804/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ndequeker"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1700884,"username":"RonaldKoster","name":"Ronald Koster","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1700884/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/RonaldKoster"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/530","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/530","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/530/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/530/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#530","relative":"#530","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#530"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":19310031,"iid":529,"project_id":7128869,"title":"Update TTL for online services to 1 day","description":"**As a** \n\u003cbr\u003e**I want to**\n\u003cbr\u003e**so that**\n\n**:white\\_check\\_mark: Acceptance criteria**\n\n1.

IRMA-api-server","description":"As communicated by IRMA, in their step to moving to a new IRMA api server implementation, they are releasing an update to the current one. We need to stay up to date. See the communication:\n\n1. Update the IRMA api server and release to production/demo BEFORE 31 jan 2019\n2. Report to Sietse that we have updated\n\n```\nDear everyone,\n\nI am mailing to everyone I know that runs or is otherwise interested in the irma_api_server, https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_api_server. This email is about the future of the irma_api_server, its upcoming replacement in Go, and also about future emails like these.\n\nLet me start with something to do:\n*Please update your irma_api_server to the latest version as soon as possible, but at least before January 31.*\nOtherwise, your irma_api_server will be incompatible with an upcoming version of the IRMA app, that we will release at that time. The reason is explained below.\n\n1) The eventual deprecation and replacement of the irma_api_server\nThe irma_api_server has been very useful and important for the IRMA ecosystem, but it has its drawbacks; it is not very flexible, or easy to configure, or easy to experiment with. Ever since we switched to the Go programming language for the IRMA app, we have been planning to eventually completely switch to Go. Therefore, we have been working on a new IRMA server in Go, that will eventually replace and deprecate the irma_api_server. This new server has been designed to be:\n- Easy to deploy and use in a multitude of environments and use cases,\n- Simple to configure and easy to experiment with,\n- More efficient and scalable across server farms,\n- more easy to automatically test using CI/CD.\nAdditionally, the new irmaserver improves legacy issues, fixes shortcomings, and improves efficiency in the protocol that it uses when issuing or verifying attributes from IRMA apps. It will be released as a library for use in backend server applications, as well as a standalone server like the irma_api_server. This new server (simply called \"irmaserver\") will be mostly compatible with the current irma_api_server. Not entirely, but when the new irmaserver is released we will simultaneously release an update of irma_js that will abstract away the differences for you as much as possible.\n\n2) End of life of the irma_api_server\nIn the migration to the new irmaserver there needs to be a compatibility mechanism that ensures that all IRMA apps works with both the new irmaserver and the old irma_api_server.  In order not to pollute the new server with legacy code, we have decided to implement this compatibility mechanism in the irma_api_server, with an update adding compatibility with the upcoming version of the IRMA app, which will be released on February 1. After that, irma_api_servers that have not yet been updated will become incompatible with the latest version of  the IRMA app. This is why it is necessary that all irma_api_servers are updated. *Once your server is updated, please let me know.*\nAfter the update introducing compatibility with both the old and the new upcoming versions of the IRMA app, the irma_api_server will no longer be actively developed, apart from bug fixes and security updates. The new irmaserver will be released soon after that.\n\n3) Future mails like these\nIRMA is, by design, a decentral system: anyone can run IRMA servers without involvement of us (the Foundation). This is an important and distinguishing feature contributing to IRMA's trustworthiness, but it also means we (the Foundation) have no way to automatically update all IRMA infrastructure. Although we of course try to prevent making breaking changes, sometimes this is unavoidable. We have to prevent that this leads to a fractured IRMA ecosystem with incompatible apps and servers, which would lead to bad user experience and hurt adoption.\nAs an alternative update channel, we will henceforth sometimes send emails like this one. The release of the upcoming irmaserver will be announced like this too. If you do *not* want to receive these emails please let me know, but in order to keep the IRMA experience for users as stable and reliable as possible, *we strongly recommend anyone running an irma_api_server, or the new irmaserver after it has been released, to stay on this list*. If you know anyone who you think should receive these emails as well, please let me know.\n\nKind regards,\nSietse Ringers.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-09T14:04:13.227Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T07:01:13.811Z","closed_at":"2019-01-28T12:43:10.300Z","closed_by":{"id":1198398,"username":"GeertJohan","name":"Geert-Johan Riemer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1198398/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/GeertJohan"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":761931,"iid":6,"group_id":3094865,"title":"Sprint 6","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-16T18:23:31.761Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T21:42:24.492Z","due_date":"2019-01-30","start_date":"2019-01-16","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/commonground/-/milestones/6"},"assignees":[{"id":1198398,"username":"GeertJohan","name":"Geert-Johan Riemer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1198398/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/GeertJohan"}],"author":{"id":2686948,"username":"timenolthof","name":"Timen Olthof","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3bd23bc6c1bc8a185a913fdcaa453fa3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/timenolthof"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1198398,"username":"GeertJohan","name":"Geert-Johan Riemer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1198398/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/GeertJohan"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2019-01-30","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/commonground/nlx/nlx/-/issues/424","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/424","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/424/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869/issues/424/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7128869","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#424","relative":"#424","full":"commonground/nlx/nlx#424"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":17064595,"iid":416,"project_id":7128869,"title":"Clarify current situation of environments and targets audiences (with visual)","description":"- Create clear description of current target audiences, environments\n- Markdown file available on gitlab\n- Relevant visuals available\n- Clear name \u0026 versioning convention incl url\n- Show how this relates to build/deploy pipelines\n- Plan how to communicate to target audiences\n\nNLX devs have their own flow with several public environments, next to the public environments ment for demo, pre prod and production.\n\nIt helps to clarify which is which, including some visual that shows flow for audiences.\n\nRough sketch  (won't be accurate in current form, but exactly that is the problem -
