For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project.

It leads to a lot of inconsistency since the updates to one instance don't propagate to the rest of the instances. Having a single mini pipeline graph component will ensure consistency of experience across the product and make it easier to implement further improvements.\n\n| Mini pipeline graph in MR widget |\n| ------ | \n| ![image](/uploads/672ba1850f8c1986b42cf75dc349224e/image.png) | \n\n#### Audit of current component instances\n\n:link: [Audit: Mini Pipeline Graph Components](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332948)\n\nThe goal of this issue is to document the mini pipeline graph component and its behavior with minor updates that improve the visual consistency and usability.

Understanding the essence of Jobs and the concepts associated with them can help us create a better experience around Jobs in GitLab UI. Currently, Jobs are not documented as an object in GitLab. It's difficult to find information around all the concepts associated with jobs and how they're represented in the UI.\n\n## Proposal\n\nDocument Jobs using the Conceptual Object Model. \n\nThis model allows for proper separation of concerns: concepts (meaning) and user interface (representation). In other words, a conceptual model is only focused on the concepts and how they relate to each other, not how it’s technically implemented or used in the UI. A conceptual model defines the objects and actions, and enumerates the attributes for every object. The language of the conceptual model diagram is meant to be as simple and accessible as possible to everyone, even if they are not familiar with these kinds of diagrams (for more information, see [Object Modeling for Designers](https://medium.com/@hpadkisson/object-modeling-for-designers-an-introduction-7871bdcf8baf).\n\nHere's an example of how we document the [Merge Request as an object in GitLab.](https://design.gitlab.com/objects/merge-request)\n\n#### Next steps\n\n- [x] Document the concepts associated with Jobs\n- [x] Map the concepts associated with Jobs\n- [x] Document the layouts for the representations of Jobs in GitLab\n- [x] Review the Figma file\n- [x] Merge to the Conceptual object model file in Figma\n- [x] Map the primary Job page layout\n- [x] Merge the semantic layout to the Layouts file \n- [x] Work on a documentation MR ([MR in review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2713))\n\n## Working Figma files\n\n* [Job object model](https://www.figma.com/file/J68bePHXIN5OPWqaFFY9ri/branch/bMpqqGQtDoPqty4sAFPUsy/Conceptual-model?node-id=5423%3A453)\n* [Job semantic layout](https://www.figma.com/file/shVF8UZwrQtkNfMDjcrsyH/branch/PZruVNvWVcpdNwm69cXgeJ/Semantic-layouts?node-id=4636%3A208)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-05T09:18:26.731Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T05:25:59.094Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T05:25:58.450Z","closed_by":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"labels":["devops::verify","documentation","group::pipeline authoring","pajamas::define","section::ops","type::maintenance","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"}],"author":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"user_notes_count":40,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/904","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":8},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/904","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/904/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/904/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#904","relative":"#904","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#904"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":86477742,"iid":903,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Themes \u003e Adding missing color palettes","description":"Within Pajamas, Figma, and GitLab-UI we define a series of color palettes for each of our available themes.

The table currently is still missing responsive states and is not leveraging some of Figma's newer layout features. \n\n### Summary of overall table updates:\n\n- All cell content is now `top` aligned by default\n- The sorting arrow has been moved closer to the right of the header label, in order to make it clear which header label they belong to \n- On hover and on focus states have been to header cells if the configuration is set to sortable\n- A new 'compressed` table option has been added (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/449)\n- A new row state has been added (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/884)\n- A new `\u003ccaption\u003e` component has been added (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1726)\n- A top border has been added to the header row in order to better visual understand where the table starts and ends on a page\n\n### Summary of Figma specific updates:\n\nSince the first version of the Figma Table component that has been added to our component library, Figma has introduced many new features specific to [Auto Layout](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-auto-layout) that make creating tables more flexible. This update will make it easier for designers to create responsive tables in Figma that are easier to customize and lower the need to detach from parent components. \n\n**Sorting interaction spec:**\n\n![table-interaction](/uploads/dd95bd2653ad5b3ea6f27e27d91c272e/table-interaction.mp4)\n\n### Rationale for current updates\n\n| Overall component usage (last 90 days) | Variants being used (last 90 days) |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.27.15_2x](/uploads/e2d38b9540191eac779dcb460a11292c/CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.27.15_2x.png) | ![CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.28.42_2x](/uploads/f51c5d9412375aea6d004c33619fc742/CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.28.42_2x.png) | \n| **Insights:**\u003cbr\u003eIn the first version of the table component a lot of time was put into creating the multi-line variant which shows no usage. | **Insights:**\u003cbr\u003eThe checkbox variant is the second most used.

For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project.

file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.\n   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.\n   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.\n\nTo move a duplicate file:\nOpen the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select\n“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location.

Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.\n   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.\n   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.\n\nTo move a duplicate file:\nOpen the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select\n“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”\n--\u003e\n\n### Description\n\n\u003c!-- Add a short description of your contribution.

Figma tooltip component with Variant","description":"\u003c!--\nStart by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:\n   - For changes to an existing file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.\n   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.\n   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.\n\nTo move a duplicate file:\nOpen the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select\n“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”\n--\u003e\n\n### Description\n\n\u003c!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding\na checklist of variations, states, and breakpoints to the description so that reviewers can be sure to cross-reference everything that has been completed. --\u003e\n\nI worked a lot recently with a tooltip. I found that the current component is not very easy to use because:\n\n1. I need to detach it every time because the container doesn't auto grow with the text\n1. After detach, I need to resize it and not very easy to keep the spacing manually\n1. I need to hide/show arrows in the layers instead of using a variant\n\nSo I updated the tooltip component structure with variants, now it can auto grow, two lines just need to hit enter and use different arrow position can be chosen from variants manual on the right-hand side. Please see the picture below :point_down: or watch this [`video intro`](https://www.loom.com/share/bd509b045e8e41f5ae4eb29fc22fb32f).\n\n\n|   Current component  |   Updated component by using variants  |\n| --- | --- |\n|    ![old-tooltip](/uploads/2a76cb80fb194e831d0759129fcffba2/old-tooltip.gif)    |  ![new-tooltip](/uploads/7d870405a99ce11fb832274a85c27257/new-tooltip.gif)|\n\n\n### Figma file\n\n\u003c!-- Before pasting the link to your Figma file/frame, in the file sharing settings, make sure that “anyone with the link” can view. --\u003e\n\n[View working file in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/nmpl8tphpsmcDlMYfiviOS/Tooltip-component-update-Pajama-805?node-id=1%3A2)\n\n### Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n1.

This could include:\n\n- Moving all content docs to one area\n    - Pros: Everything is in one place, you always know where to go to find what you need. Content isn't duplicated.\n    - Cons: There are separate use cases for docs and product, so the documentation in this section could be expansive. Good IA would be needed so its easy to find details.\n- Keeping documentation docs and product docs separate, with clear cross-linking as needed.\n    - Pros: Separation of concerns could make it easier to find detailed docs as needed\n    - Cons: A lot of content overlaps, so it may be difficult to fully dedupe and could mean lots of cross linking and jumping back and forth between sections.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-05T19:45:18.779Z","updated_at":"2022-01-14T10:20:36.838Z","closed_at":"2022-01-14T10:07:17.329Z","closed_by":{"id":8702682,"username":"dianalogan","name":"Diana Logan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8702682/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dianalogan"},"labels":["Category:Design System","Technical Writing","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.

Update the List components to include complex list items as displayed throughout the product (see examples below). \n\n##### Examples \n\n| Issue list view |\n|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2020-09-09_at_2.49.45_PM](/uploads/ef24b4f65c62dc092242e77fdc014cb0/Screen_Shot_2020-09-09_at_2.49.45_PM.png)|\n\n| Package list view |\n|---|\n|![Screen_Shot_2020-09-11_at_15.47.49](/uploads/923786fe38e070c7b30de002245c20a5/Screen_Shot_2020-09-11_at_15.47.49.png)|\n\n\n### Figma file\n\n\u003c!-- Before pasting the link to your Figma file/frame, in the file sharing settings, make sure that “anyone with the link” can view. --\u003e\n\n[View working file in Figma →](ADD LINK TO FIGMA FILE/FRAME)\n\n### Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n1.

(https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.\n   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.\n   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.\n\nTo move a duplicate file:\nOpen the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select\n“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”\n--\u003e\n\n### Description\n\n\u003c!-- Add a short description of your contribution.

[x] **Maintainer**: Review and approve assignee’s changes.\n1. [x] **Maintainer**: Add the changes or additions to the target file. For \n   example, you’d copy a final chart design from the working file and paste into the related location in the Data Visualization file.\n     1. [x] Ensure that all styles and components now belong to the target file.\n     1. [ ] For changes to the **Component Library** file, view the components in the Assets panel to ensure they align with our [asset library structure guidelines][structure].\n1. [x] **Maintainer**: When applicable, [publish][publishing] any library \n   changes along with a clear commit message.\n1. [-] **Assignee**: Move your working file to the shared Figma project (file was a branch, so archived by the maintainer using the branch feature).\n1. [-] **Assignee** (or Maintainer, for community contributions): If it’s a new\n   pattern or a significant change, add an agenda item to the next UX weekly call to inform the team.\n1.

A gauge chart is a single metric chart.\n\n#### Example use case\n\nAn SRE viewing metrics in the Metrics dashboard when investigating an incident. A gauge chart instantly communicates to the user the status of the metric, even when viewed at a small size. At a glance the user understands whether the value is falling within an acceptable range.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- The chart should clearly communicate the current value and show where that value falls within the ranges set by the user (2 or 3 ranges can be set).\n- Users can set alerts on the metric, so we need to make sure that when the alert is firing it's immediately visible\n- The value ranges don't have to coincide with the alert threshold. The user should be able to set an alert for any value regardless of what range it falls into\n- The chart should be readable even at a very small size. It's not uncommon for our users to have multiple gauge charts crammed into a small dashboard area to form a \"speedometer\" of sort. Check out [one of the GitLab dashboards ](https://dashboards.gitlab.com/d/sv_pUrImz/ci-autoscaled-machines-metrics?orgId=1\u0026refresh=5m\u0026from=now-30d\u0026to=now\u0026var-dc=All\u0026var-runner_group=All\u0026var-cpu_mode=nice)for an example. Currently, GitLab Metrics charts aren't resizeable, but they will be in the future.\n\n#### States/ variants\n\n- [x] Alert set\n- [x] Alert firing\n- [x] Low range, mid range, high range\n- [x] Large (expanded chart view)\n- [x] Small (50%)\n\n### Additional details\n\nWe will be building the chart using the [Gauge e-charts component.](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge)\n\nNotes for the docs:\n- Leave a note in the component description that states that the header is mandatory but the size should vary depending on page content/hierarchy. \n\n\u003c!--Add a short description of the component. If it’s helpful, add a checklist of variations\nand states to the description so that a reviewer can be sure to cross reference everything\nthat has been completed.--\u003e\n\n\u003c!--Use the Figma share feature and make sure that “anyone with the link” can view. Then,\nspecifically invite the reviewer with “edit” permissions selected. Anyone can duplicate the\nfile to their own drafts and edit from there, but the reviewer can directly edit and\ncollaborate on the file.

component page template: re-evaluate content based on JTBDs","description":"## Overview\n\nLet's re-evaluate the content (and structure) of the PJs component page template to improve the utility and usability for GitLab designers, devs and PMs. This is related to the broader PJs information architecture challenges mentioned in gitlab-org/gitlab-design#798. \n\nThe best way to prioritise, manage and refine the content on the page is by using Jobs to be done.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe main pain points I found with component page templates today:\n\n- **Text-heavy** - PJs is much more text-heavy than most other design systems. Much of the text content could be replaced with images and demos. The large amount of content makes it hard to scan and find the information I'm looking for.\n- **Usage guidance vs implementation guidance** - Content on implementation guidance ([as discussed here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/536)) is left in the usage guidelines - adding to the text-heaviness. This also reduces the clarity on the usage guidance in general.\n- **Burying the lead** - The current structure is setting pages up in a way where the demo is at the bottom of the page behind a bunch of text which may or may not be relevant for your use case. A new structure is required which front loads the demo and dives into details later. Following similar ideas to the [Minto Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7).\n- **Additional content** - We also have a lot of other content that could be interesting to include in a design system as stated in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/1111) - this doesn't need to be shown on the page, but could at least be linked, so we see the thought and rationale that has gone into designing the component\n- **Variation** - There a lot of inconsistency in how component usage guidelines are written.\n\n## Idea\n\n\u003e “If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand meetings” - **David Kelley, IDEO** \n\nSome general principles for laying out these pages:\n- **JTBD \u0026 role-informed** - We should differentiate sections and prioritise what content goes on the page based on what our primary personas are trying to achieve\n- **Demo-heavy** - We should front-load our component pages with visual content and demos for a quicker understanding\n- **Show me \u003e tell me** - We should strip away as much text as possible in favour of demos and programmatically embedding rules, styles and interactions\n- **On-page nav** - We should have on-page navigation for quicker access to particular sections\n- **Standardise component usage sub-sections** - We should standardise on component usage sub-sections to improve consistency and clarity (e.g.[IBM carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage#content) standardized on component variations, content guidelines \u0026 interactions/functionality). This also makes it easier to spot whether any functionality or styles are missing.\n\nI think [IBM Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) and [Salesforce Lightning](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) are both great examples of prioritising which JTBD they want to satisfy for designers \u0026 devs without being too text-heavy.\n\n## Jobs to be done\n\nCreate a ranked list of JTBD to prioritise content on the page:\n\n| Title | Situation | Motivation | Desired outcome | Persona |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| **General usage guidance** | When I am unfamiliar with a component, | I want a quick and high-level overview of the what the component looks like, how it works and its most popular use cases, | so that I know whether or not I should use it. | All |\n| **Design tool component** | When using a component, | I want a representation of that component in Figma/Sketch | so that I can quickly work with it in my designs | Designer |\n| **Detailed usage guidance** | When using a component, | I want to understand details of variations, style, functionality and accessibility | so that I use the component in the way it was designed | Designer |\n| **Component usage in the product** | When using a component, | I want to where else in the product it is being used, how much it is being used and for what use cases, | so that I | All |\n| **Design decisions** | When using a component, | I want to understand how research, discussions \u0026 usage helped decide on a specific design, tenet or guideline | so that I understand why the component was designed in that way | Designer |\n| **Component gaps** | When using a component, | I want to understand whether this current iteration of the component has the variations, style, additional functionality and accessibility required for my use case | so that I know whether we should update it or not | Designer |\n| **Component pipeline** | When using a component, | I want to see if there are any new components or updates in the pipeline | so that I can utilise the component or collaborate with the person who is working on it | Designer |\n| **Component development guidance** | When building components, | I want to understand what patterns should be embedded into the component programmatically | so that the component works in the way it was designed. | Developer |\n| **design.gitlab, GitLab-ui \u0026 figma/sketch sync** | When using a component, | I want to be sure that the component variations, style, additional functionality and accessibility in design.gitlab reflect what is shown in gitlab-ui and figma/sketch | so that I have an accurate representation of what's available and continuity of understanding with other roles in my team | All |\n| **Add/edit component** | When reviewing PJs and I see missing/incorrect component content | I would like to add/edit content | so that I contribute to refining our design system | Designer |\n| **Integrating component** | When I am integrating a component in our [component lifecycle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/blob/master/doc/component-lifecycle.md) | I want to ... | so that ... | Developers |\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Gather** - Use this issue to collate what the primary the JTBD for designers, devs, PMs, technical writers, researchers\n1. **Prioritise** - Prioritise the JTBD to prioritise the content in PJs\n1. **Create template** - Create a new content template based on our prioritisation\n1. **Create vision mockup** - Create a new vision mockup of what PJs component pages could be\n\n## Additional ideas\n\n- On page table of contents\n- Additional tabs\n- Changing structure of pages to front-load demos and visual content at top of page\n   - First step would be changing component template file: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/master/pages/components/template.md\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Determine a new structure that allows users to easily find the content they are looking for. The end result of this issue should be working page templates and consistent sections and language.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-27T16:12:27.424Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T20:07:12.328Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T17:57:48.346Z","closed_by":{"id":516904,"username":"tauriedavis","name":"Taurie

This could be confusing as error text could be partially duplicative of the help text. Depending on how the help text is tied to the input for accessibility, this could also add confusion, or cause some info to be missed. Because the help text remains gray, it visually feels disconnected with an input in error state.\n\n## Solution\n\nHelp text is a single, dynamic text block with the potential for multiple states.\n\n* By default it is instructional and in a neutral palette\n* When an error occurs the help text becomes more explanatory so that a user knows how to correct the error. The danger palette is used.\n\nIn this case there is inly one help text block for instruction and error prevention.\n\n| **Before** | **After** |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Frame_1](/uploads/bda6fdfcebb2d5ae11204f5af07e0451/Frame_1.png) | ![Frame_2](/uploads/cffdf4046b706318d38fbd325cdafc68/Frame_2.png) |\n\n/cc @uhlexsis @tauriedavis @pedroms","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T04:24:58.393Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T16:35:09.377Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T14:02:46.878Z","closed_by":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"labels":["UX","component:form","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/901","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/901","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/901/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/901/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#901","relative":"#901","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#901"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31850907,"iid":490,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Combine contents of \"Vue component\" and \"Design\" tabs into a single page","description":"There is often duplicated content between the tabs.

We have tried to circumvent this specific issue by [wrapping components in a custom element](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1737) where GitLab UI styles would be injected in the Shadow DOM. While this solution was promising as it stopped all CSS leak issues, some components like tooltips and popovers aren't Shadow DOM-ready and aren't able to render when they don't have access to the global `document`. More generally, this approach brought us back to problem `#2`.\n\n\n## 2. Styling elements in the global scope\n\nTo prevent GitLab UI's styles from conflicting with `design.gitlab.com`'s styles, we have scoped its styles to the `.app-styles` class: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/5f1e9246192f9f04dcd50cefa55985d63c0f88ce/assets/stylesheets/app.scss#L33-36\n\nThis lets us apply components styles locally, without affecting the rest of the website.\n\nThis is a sensible approach but we've reached its limits as some components are appending elements to the `body` in the global scope. Since those elements are escaping the `.app-styles` scope, they can't be styled properly, unless we can come up with specific workarounds. For example, we've been able to preserve styles for the `GlModal` component by adding the `.app-styles` class to its wrapper element: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/5f1e9246192f9f04dcd50cefa55985d63c0f88ce/layouts/default.vue#L103-114\nThere are other cases, like the `GlToast` component, where there is no obvious workaround that we can apply, resulting in a broken looking element in the demo:\n\n![Screen_Shot_2020-03-06_at_3.16.40_PM](/uploads/d1250bfa79c17a6631ea60fb7f46b350/Screen_Shot_2020-03-06_at_3.16.40_PM.png)\n\nOverall, we should try to make it as easy as possible to include components demos in `design.gitlab.com`. Having to come up with workarounds makes for a poor developer experience.\n\n# How can we address these issues?\n\n## 1. Prevent `.md` styles from leaking too deep in the DOM\n\nTo prevent `.md` styles from affecting too many of their children, let's make sure that the CSS rules only apply to direct children in `.md`. This will prevent the CSS from leaking into component demos, reducing the need for explicitly setting CSS rules in GitLab UI to override Pajamas' styles.\n\nThis approach has a downside: Markdown elements can be nested. For example: `\u003e ### A title in a blockquote`. By applying styles on direct children only, those nested elements will not be styled properly. Since Pajamas doesn't seem to contain any nested Markdown element at the moment, this fix should be acceptable considering its benefits outweigh its disadvantages.\n\nMR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1753\n\n## 2.
