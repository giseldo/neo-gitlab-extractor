Today, we treat `copy blue with an underline` as a standard and desired state for links, but from recent feedback on Verify features, we were able to surface a need for multiple visual treatments for the same.\n\nThere are pages in the product that list resources, and for their contextual identification it is vital to retain links to associated resources. Example- a pipeline can be best identified in the presence of the commit name/number, branch name, merge request details and triggerer information. Not every user would make use of all of these link, but the personas interacting with these pages are varied and through research we have learn that removing any of these information can prove to be disruptive to a huge number of users.\n\nPresence of many different links as a group, with each demanding user's attention can turn out to be very visually disorienting. To combat this discomfort, we should consider providing different visual treatments to those links. For example - the link that belongs to the resources that is primary to the page can have a blue color, while for the other links we can go for a subdued visual affordance, ma be dark gray with an underline?\n\nWe are already doing this on a few pages, such as issues, where we do not give a blue color to link, and at other pages where many different links in a single line have different treatments. To ensure that we provide our users with a coherent experience across platforms, we should document primary and alternate treatments for links and the circumstances under which they should be used. \n\n### Use cases\n\nI'm listing use-cases from Verify since I'm more versed in those.\n\n#### Pipeline Execution: Pipeline index page\n| Image | Resources linked |\n|------------|-------------|\n| ![Screen_Shot_2022-03-11_at_7.53.59_PM](/uploads/cbd212019cf9d1d33c91f430b5297f72/Screen_Shot_2022-03-11_at_7.53.59_PM.png) | Commit, Merge request, Branch, Pipeline |\n\n#### Release: Environment list view\n| Image | Resources linked |\n|-------|------------------|\n|![Screen_Shot_2022-03-11_at_7.56.55_PM](/uploads/40cc14beba9676504d1cd3b3d2be1d39/Screen_Shot_2022-03-11_at_7.56.55_PM.png) | Commit, Branch, Deployment |\n\n#### Another example of what to avoid:\n\nLinks with no affordance inline with plain text. Here, they should have at least an underline, and probably different color too.\n\n| What's a link? | Links |\n|-------|------|\n|![image](/uploads/da4da55541ce8824ed9c6e13f87f6899/image.png)|![image](/uploads/f060ae0cfb5800fdb4c700711da649ec/image.png)|\n\n-----------\n\n### Few consideration highlighted by @jeldergl in a [slack thread](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C010NAWPRV4/p1646921391954459):\n\n\u003e 1. Ensure these are understood as links in context.\n\u003e 1. See what can be done to make the gray links look more like a link.\n\u003e 1. Be extremely clear when documenting the use case while referencing all of the factors.\n\u003e 1. Ensure that what‚Äôs decided on and documented here can be abstracted out enough to address similar parts of the UI without creating loopholes.\n\n------------\n\n### Resources\n\n- [WCAG Success Criteria 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color)\n- https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-link--default-link\n- https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6414\n- [UI type scale link style in Pajamas UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=542%3A334) \n- [Documentation markdown link style in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/V3HKN83B7rf2T6sseLMrxa/Type-scale---Documentation-Markdown?node-id=1%3A97) \n- [Compact markdown link style in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mjAZxHkK95TlQ6L14aNp2M/Type-scale---Compact-Markdown?node-id=5%3A44)\n- [Link styles (ideal state) in MR widget instances](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=38193%3A30482)\n\n_Also view linked issues_\n\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-ux/designers","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-11T14:40:50.808Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T14:38:22.321Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T14:38:22.302Z","closed_by":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"labels":["pajamas::define","workflow::start"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":6115425,"username":"veethika","name":"Veethika M","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f09a3a0badac17a57e28b4e18a45c1c0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/veethika"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1266","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1266","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1266/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1266/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1266","relative":"#1266","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1266"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104591009,"iid":1265,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Data visualization - Update mini pipeline graph dropdown tooltips to include trigger job instance","description":"\u003c!--\nStart by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:\n   - For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the ‚Äúworking file‚Äù).

See a similar effort for [unboxing the modal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1221).\n\n**How does this benefit the UI and support unboxing?**\n\n- The popover has hierarchy established with different font weights, the dividing border just reenforces the hierarchy that already exists.\n- Similar to the results in the modal, this also allows us to remove the extra padding needed when there are two separate sections, effectively reducing popover height.\n- Removing the border between the header and content allows for a more natural reading flow between header and content without the visual break that makes them feel less connected.\n\n![CleanShot_2022-03-02_at_10.21.47_2x](/uploads/30063e66c8421fa282c6b84d4f9099b6/CleanShot_2022-03-02_at_10.21.47_2x.png)\n\n### Result\n\n![CleanShot_2022-03-23_at_13.15.56](/uploads/ff6a16400ca5ca585f95489e61b2f22e/CleanShot_2022-03-23_at_13.15.56.gif)\n\n### Figma file\n\n\u003c!-- Before pasting the link to your Figma file/frame, in the file sharing settings, make sure that ‚Äúanyone with the link‚Äù can view or that a specific user has been invited to the file. --\u003e\n\n[View working branch in Figma ‚Üí](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/a9sU9h6eO7waDKgaltWEzX/Component-library?node-id=425%3A131)\n\n### Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n1.

After more learning around what constitutes options within a dropdown, it' seems's clear that using literal form elements is _not_ ideal and doesn't reflect the semantics for options within a [listbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/listbox_role) or [combobox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/combobox_role).\n\n**Current**\n\n![image](/uploads/6a2018fb1ac333b0f94f7b04c557d8b4/image.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\nUpdate the design of options within a dropdown panel to represent a selection without using literal form elements. This can be based on the previous design and should include the following states:\n\n- Rest\n- Hover (`:hover`)\n- Focus (`:focus`)\n- Active/pressed (`:active`)\n- Selected\n\nSince multi-select is a function of the component and context, and not an individual option (that uses `role=\"option\"`), the design of an option can be the same for single and multi-select.\n\n**Proposed design**:\n\n![image](/uploads/6002e7764c2aa09e6f495efc19428139/image.png)\n\n- Include a tip pointing to the referring trigger.\n- Ensure the panel uses the correct [shadow](https://design.gitlab.com/layout/layers#shadows).\n- Use a small :mag: icon in the search input to help with alignment and feel more in scale with the text (might consider this elsewhere in the future too).\n- Selected item has rounded rectangle container.\n- Border radius increased on panel to keep in proportion to border radius of elements within.\n- Left aligned header.\n- Option for panel action (to clear all, unassign, etc.).\n\n### Concepts\n\nThere's a matrix of options:\n\n- Edge-to-edge option vs. inset rounded rectangle. Space is the primary consideration, but more space could benefit distinguishing options at the cost of a bit more scrolling. The inset rounded rectangle would also be closer to how flyouts are handled in the left navigation.\n- Gray vs. blue selected item background. While gray keeps the UI more subdued, the use of blue aligns with our prescribed use to indicate a current or active state and also provides more differentiation with hover states.\n- Checkmark vs. border selection indicator. Space is also a consideration here, but what type of indicator makes identifying a selection quick, clear, while not impeding readability is most important.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eüëÅ‚Äçüó® View initial concepts\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n|  | **Blue highlight** | **Gray highlight** |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| **Edge-to-edge checkmark ‚úì** | ![image](/uploads/853b75f239fe11992139b5eaace0b749/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/43f06cd9dce1c413726feee9046cc30a/image.png) |\n| **Inset rectangle checkmark ‚úì** | ![image](/uploads/b514790592a5fa37299dd43697a571cd/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/0072c55722317f8e707e09e8410add5a/image.png) |\n| **Edge-to-edge border ‚éÆ** | ![image](/uploads/0f7bd70470b6a06512387e197b09792d/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/0ffc282090a3f475310013761ac4594c/image.png) |\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eüéõ View more examples for comparison\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n|  | **Blue highlight** | **Gray highlight** |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| **Edge-to-edge checkmark ‚úì** | ![image](/uploads/c3ebc834761bccf63bd209894014e882/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/460b5b7655352680db9781e67d550c50/image.png) |\n| **Inset rectangle checkmark ‚úì** | ![image](/uploads/da79ea31840c41c4f27c01bcb0632521/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/1f5d8bb617ee2072a8b4f0bf79655e07/image.png) |\n| **Edge-to-edge border ‚éÆ** | ![image](/uploads/5ad4eeb430ec9403a74c455199a716da/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/52dcab7d48a244918e6f30716dd367dc/image.png) |\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n---\n\n**Additional considerations**:\n\n![image](/uploads/3bba28255f23804735cafbb7123285ab/image.png)\n\n1.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/739 we can update the icons in the Pajamas UI Kit.\n\nThe new icons will be maintained in a separate file from the component library for easier maintenance and sharing.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. [x] Ensure all icons that weren't updated in the recent effort, but are still part of the library, are included in the new icon file. For example, pipeline, issue type, and brand icons.\n1. [x] Publish the new icon library and add it to our community page.\n1. [x] Replace the icons in the component library with the ones from the new icon library.\n1. [x] Deprecate the old icons by removing them from the component library and placing into a separate file that will be archived.\n1. [x] Publish an updated version of the component library.\n1. [x] Mention the breaking change in the UX Weekly with directions on using the new library.\n1. [x] Create a new MR to update the iconography guidelines in Pajamas.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-10T18:27:17.578Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:10:08.216Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T21:05:25.503Z","closed_by":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"labels":["Category:Design System","Icon","devops::manage","group::foundations","section::dev","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":2156369,"iid":68,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T17:39:41.786Z","due_date":"2022-01-17","start_date":"2021-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68"},"assignees":[{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"}],"author":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1202","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":7},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1202","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1202/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1202/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1202","relative":"#1202","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1202"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98765575,"iid":1201,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Illustration \u003e Add more grid information","description":"## Purpose\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2636 the product illustration guidelines were updated.

Currently we don't have any contribution guidelines for documenting objects. For someone unfamiliar with the purpose and process of object modeling it can be intimidating and difficult to get started.\n\nThe conceptual object model becomes more useful as more objects and layouts are documented since it helps communicate the relationships between different objects. The more objects and layouts we document (even if the model is imperfect at first), the more we'll be able to use it. For example, it can help identify important object relationships and ensure we don't overlook them in our design work.\n\n## üí° Proposal\n\nWe don't need to create a perfect set of guidelines and templates to start benefiting from the documented model. The objective is to create an MVC set of guidelines and resources to get more product designers interested in contributing.\n\nThis issue will focus on adding an Object issue template to guide designers as they document the conceptual model and the layouts for the object.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T12:16:48.525Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T19:13:34.155Z","closed_at":"2022-02-24T05:02:54.028Z","closed_by":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"labels":["pajamas::define","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"}],"author":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4706959,"username":"nadia_sotnikova","name":"Nadia Sotnikova","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4706959/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/nadia_sotnikova"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1151","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1151","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1151/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1151/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1151","relative":"#1151","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1151"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6735,"epic":{"id":348115,"iid":6735,"title":"Set up contribution process for Objects in Pajamas","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6735","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":94525527,"iid":1137,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Date picker - make month/year look more interactive","description":"# Problem\n\n- The date picker has a dropdown for the month and year and nobody knows about it!\n- Related to #601.

The **Text area** component can remain as true/false as long as the character count is the only option.\n- All component variants will need to be updated to look the same as they do today, only they will have the correct add-on chosen by default.

For example:\n\n| Beginning | All possible elements (Base component) |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.12_AM](/uploads/5440df806d6010c37e7b7c6e7976faa7/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.12_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM](/uploads/b6745b7566efb4ffa2cd2548ee6d173d/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM.png) |\n\nWhich should be the structure image? My assumption is to use the base component so we can describe each possible visible element. \n\n2. Should we include multiple structure images if there are different variants? For example:\n\n| Single file uploader | Multi file uploader |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM](/uploads/9e2089c97144d8f97abcf4d75babf39d/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.37.34_AM](/uploads/1d2c201ce6b8bbadb557d5ec17d76a97/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.37.34_AM.png) | \n\nAgain, my assumption is we include both, with unique lists for each.

We are also updating the docs pages to utilize a new doc template, which utilizes the `description:` item, so if the components without a Vue component get updated to the new template, those updates will be blocked until this is resolved.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-08T13:06:31.718Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:24:54.122Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T16:07:12.190Z","closed_by":{"id":3732265,"username":"pgascouvaillancourt","name":"Paul Gascou-Vaillancourt","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a190c0b1ff5772c9230b4d9a38ac608?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pgascouvaillancourt"},"labels":["devops::manage","group::foundations","workflow::start"],"milestone":{"id":1948702,"iid":63,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:43:36.613Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:29.231Z","due_date":"2021-09-17","start_date":"2021-08-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":2222493,"username":"jareko","name":"Jarek Ostrowski","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2222493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jareko"}],"author":{"id":2222493,"username":"jareko","name":"Jarek Ostrowski","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2222493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jareko"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2222493,"username":"jareko","name":"Jarek Ostrowski","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2222493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jareko"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1114","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1114","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1114/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1114/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1114","relative":"#1114","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1114"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93192659,"iid":1111,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Pajamas UI Kit \u003e Update top nav Figma component","description":"\u003c!--\nStart by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:\n   - For changes to an existing file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation).

\u003e Explore documentation hierarchy","description":"## Purpose\n\nWhen working through some Pajamas research related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/541, I noticed that the concept of button categories and variants was confusing for users. I still mull it over from time to time too. I‚Äôm wondering if perhaps we could reconsider the hierarchy of information here to simplify it? \n\n| **Current** | **Proposed** |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| **Category:**\u003cbr\u003e- Primary\u003cbr\u003e- Secondary\u003cbr\u003e- Tertiary\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Variants:**\u003cbr\u003e- Confirm\u003cbr\u003e- Default\u003cbr\u003e- Dashed\u003cbr\u003e- Danger\u003cbr\u003e- Link | **Variants:**\u003cbr\u003e- Confirm\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;  - Primary\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;  - Secondary\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;  - Tertiary\u003cbr\u003e- Default\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;  - _Same pattern as Confirm_\u003cbr\u003e-¬†‚Ä¶ |\n\nThis would focus on the variants, and then the options for each variant.
