[x] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.\n1. [x] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.\n1. [x] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Comments**: Make sure all comments and discussion are resolved.\n\nIf any of these tasks are unclear, see the [Table component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=47785%3A58915) for reference. \n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eRequesting a review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAsk a [Foundations designer][foundations-team] to review your design.\n\n1.

This is a common accordion-like pattern that would allow a user to compare the options in different sections. While this UX might not be ideal for some sites, it can be a benefit for a user of Pajamas to get a better understanding why there are **Form elements** in one section, and **Forms** in another.\n- Sticky expanded sections. Since some sections (like **Components**) are quite long, having the parent category item sticky when expanded can help a user maintain context for the current section they're navigating.\n- Update

following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n### Assignee tasks:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eGetting started:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n1. [x] Title the issue using this structure \"Figma \u003e [Component name] - [Description]\". For example, Figma \u003e Badges - Fix icon override bug.\n1. [x] Add the relevant [component label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/labels?subscribed=\u0026search=component%3A). For example ~\"component:badge\".\n1. [ ] If you’re making updates or breaking changes to an existing component in the [Pajamas UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/781156790581391771), start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the UI kit. Prefix the branch name with the issue, MR, or epic number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, `#860-table-component-updates-lvanc`. \n1. [ ] When applicable, follow our [structure][structure], [building][building], and [annotation][annotation] guidelines. If you have any questions, reach out to a [Foundations designer][foundations-team].\n1. [x] Update the link to the working file under the **Figma link** section below.\n1. [ ] If work was not done in a branch (a merged branch will automatically be archived), move your working file \n   to the shared Figma project:\n     1. For Component library changes, move your file to the [**Component archive**][component-archive] project.\n     1. For all other changes, move your file to the [**Misc archive**][misc-archive] project.\n     1. If you’re a community contributor, please consider [transferring ownership of your draft file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040530853) to the maintainer so they can move it to our archive, along with its version history and comments.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ePrior to review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe purpose of these tasks is to ensure consistency with the rest of the components and to save time during the review process. When you are finished with your update, please go through the following clean-up tasks in Figma:\n\n1. [ ] **Canvas**: Make sure no hidden elements have been accidentally left behind. Use **View \u003e Show Outlines** (\u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eY\u003c/kbd\u003e) to reveal invisible objects. Use **View \u003e Zoom to Fit** (\u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003e1\u003c/kbd\u003e) to view all items on the page.\n1. [ ] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.\n1. [ ] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.\n1. [ ] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [ ] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.\n1. [ ] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Comments**: Make sure all comments and discussion are resolved.\n\nIf any of these tasks are unclear, see the [Table component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=47785%3A58915) for reference. \n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eRequesting a review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAsk a [Foundations designer][foundations-team] to review your design.\n\n1.

The current Pajamas neutral palette is completely desaturated and feels more generic than it could. There have been previous efforts to explore introducing both a cool and warm set of neutrals to compliment the current ones, however it became clear that this would be to try and account for the current theme approach (warm neutrals with red theme for example), and add unnecessary complexity to an already minimally used feature.\n\nHaving a neutral palette that skews more towards the temperature of the brand palette will provide more continuity between digital properties and subtly allow us to infuse more of the brand into Pajamas and the product. Given our use of blue for primary actions and links, a more cool palette also helps elements to feel more harmonious. \n\n## Proposal\n\nUpdate the neutral palette to align with the grays in the brand palette.\n\n|  | **Palette** |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| Brand | ![image](/uploads/415a82d85c280e978fcf32218e192bd4/image.png) |\n| Current neutral | ![image](/uploads/684166acb8815214fab2f7a34db1dafb/image.png) |\n| Proposed neutral | ![image](/uploads/91da0369d725d7a0ebc47dfde33f86f0/image.png) |\n\n**[![Figmacon.svg](/uploads/baf691a3cd8db4987642840392ab8c95/Figmacon.svg) View working file in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/tjSjgnxomkqPg8BEhPdNFJ/%231452-tine-neutral-palette-%40jeldergl?node-id=0%3A1)**\n\n**[![Figmacon.svg](/uploads/baf691a3cd8db4987642840392ab8c95/Figmacon.svg) View UI kit branch in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/XRCIH8ZdaAbyBpkJzgxdKG/%F0%9F%93%99-Component-library)**\n\n**[🎨 View palette in Huetone→](https://huetone.ardov.me/?palette=N4IgdghgtgpiBcIDiAZABAORgVwC4CcIAbAZxABoQALbGM%2BAbVElgRCz0KIpAGMB7Iv3z0GIAMQAzAKwyZPKQAZJyxQoAmAIy1aFmyfv0KAnKbMKAHADZr1hVYeOF0mC5fOATNK8eFAFkUAgIUAZkUwsIUARkkYmJAAXQBfcmZoOEQOAmI0AUEeASERBDEpfQhJdQUYXhqYSQ1edSa4SnFDSV4QhQg-CBCIC0tjC1GqtoB2EImPCaG2qw8rKJtnEOko6XmJPxC-Dz9t8RCTjxCjuJgDxJS01kQAIUIwcb5BYVEJSW%2BfjSj1RTqbptdT-QHAiQQDwQKIQKw9aGw%2BGTPwTKITCAKCao9GYtp%2BaT7PyvcQEokkjyaDwWc4KSnU2ltdFREIeKI3BKUXD8MB0EogKJqSjSIUCxSijzinhhUUBUUi0VWKWUCbKkAWNXGTUim5AA)**\n\n**Other thoughts…**\n\nYes, this is subjective and nuanced. When exploring navigation updates both in the product, and Pajamas, designers have noted that the current neutrals are just too flat. We have an opportunity to better align the recent brand work and the product, and this is a very subtle, but effective way to do so.\n\nA cool neutral palette could also benefit dark UI and ironically (ignoring the terms) prevent it from feeling too cold or bland. [From this article](https://compilezero.medium.com/dark-mode-ui-design-the-definitive-guide-part-1-color-53dcfaea5129):\n\n\u003e …you could also use accented neutrals instead of a pure-grey palette, which I personally recommend using due to 2 main reasons,\n\u003e \n\u003e _Pure greys are not found naturally, and so its a good option to have some tint on those neutrals to give it a more natural vibe._\n\u003e \n\u003e _Tinted neutrals, could help give the UI an overall emphasized tone and emotion to look forward to._\n\n**Resources**\n\n- https://designerup.co/blog/practical-guide-to-perfect-ui-color-palettes/\n- https://compilezero.medium.com/dark-mode-ui-design-the-definitive-guide-part-1-color-53dcfaea5129\n- https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/119887/dark-ui-design-why-tint-the-dark-gray-colors-with-a-different-primary-color\n- https://atmos.style/blog/lch-color-space\n- https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-28T14:26:52.192Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T14:24:32.261Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T14:38:04.427Z","closed_by":{"id":4477803,"username":"pburdette","name":"Payton Burdette","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4477803/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pburdette"},"labels":["Category:Design System","devops::manage","foundation::color","group::foundations","section::dev","workflow::start"],"milestone":{"id":1212252,"iid":48,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 1-3 releases","description":"Issues which are not quite ready to schedule, but should be considered as part of the near-term roadmap.","state":"active","created_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:39:10.889Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/48"},"assignees":[{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"}],"author":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1452","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1452","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1452/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1452/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1452","relative":"#1452","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1452"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":117214787,"iid":1448,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Pajamas Migration Day: December 2, 2022","description":"As part of our ongoing [component migration push](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/epic-burndown-charts/fy23-q1/), we are hosting another Pajamas Migration Day!\n\n- **When:** December 2, 2022\n- **Who:** Everyone!

What that means is that it isn't something to be used on it's own as an actual dropdown variant, but instead it's consumed by both the disclosure (optional) and combobox (required).\n\nLikewise, it's been determined that the menu variant isn't something we'll proceed with for now since the disclosure can fir the use cases we have today in the product.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Place necessary listbox content within the [combobox](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-combobox) page.\n- Deprecate the [listbox](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-listbox) page.\n- From the [disclosure](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-disclosure) page, link to the new listbox section under combobox as the SSoT.\n- Deprecate the [menu](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-menu) page.\n- Consider adding decision trees in the _when to use_ section(s) to help determine what to use.\n\nThe above changes would leave us with only the disclosure and combobox dropdown variants.

option to put selected items at top of dropdown","description":"## Problem to solve\n\nWithout a dropdown pattern that shows the selected items at the top, I can't see what those selections are without a lot of scrolling in the dropdown. The truncation in the button suggests that there are more items, but how do I know what these are? Example from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345430/designs/Runner_tag_field_states.png#note_1074738137:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/411cf209d509257ec56bdc8b8214ee2a/Screen_Shot_2022-08-23_at_2.08.30_PM.png\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\n\nI'd have to scroll down through potentially hundreds of items to see what the `+2 more` refers to (and/or to unselect them). Sometimes the dropdown doesn't even show the complete list, which makes it impossible to find it unless I know what I'm looking for and can use the search to find it (and unselect it, for example). \n\n## Proposal\n\n| 5 items | 6+ items creates a scrollable area |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/a0519c2f232eda7f84a57b3205f35b41/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/6a4c06a5df719deb4aa02635991d0dac/image.png) |\n\nIn order to prevent the selection from moving around within the input, which could be a frustrating and disorienting experience, the selection should move _after_ the dropdown is closed so it's shown when it's re-opened. This is different than how it currently works in the Assignees dropdown.\n\nExample: \n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-08-23_at_3.21.20_PM](/uploads/3d4f5b7fc9b869fa682dc694f9b5bad5/Screen_Shot_2022-08-23_at_3.21.20_PM.png)\n\nAs far as I can tell, this type of dropdown isn't available in

\u003e Note smallest recommended font size","description":"## Purpose\n\nSome instances of type are showing up that are smaller than the 12px allowed by the current type scales (UI type scale). 12px is a good minimum size and should be used in limited capacity for short meta-like copy and actions. There is no minimum mentioned in Pajamas (although it's implied by the type scale styles), and it'd be helpful to document.\n\nThere is subjectivity when it comes to font size and preference, but that's all the more reason to set a baseline and guidance. For example, browsers handle antialiasing differently and rendering \"quality\" will vary. GitLab makes use of system fonts, and some, like Helvetica, have tighter spacing and less character definition so that text is harder to read at small sizes. One user will not have the same eyesight as the next, so setting a minimum can also help remove subjectivity and preference for what should be the minimum size.\n\nIf content is worth displaying, then it should be worth displaying legibly.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- On mobile, if the font size of an input is not at least 16px, then input will be scaled up (at least in Safari).\n- Typeface, font weight, color, line-height, measure, and style can all impact legibility.\n- While WCAG doesn't prescribe a minimum font size, it does address contrast for type\n- Pixels are referenced as the unit in this issue, but in code relative units should be used so that a user can scale the type in browser (using pixels prevents this). If a browser's default size is 16px (1rem), then 12px = 0.75rem.\n- Screen resolution will impact legibility.\n\n| **Helvetica, Firefox** | **Helvetica, Firefox, standard resolution** | **San Francisco, Firefox** |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![CleanShot_2022-08-03_at_08.59.44_2x](/uploads/b0b4cb53e2d29c3a6f4f530c3c5aff49/CleanShot_2022-08-03_at_08.59.44_2x.png) | ![CleanShot_2022-08-03_at_09.00.29_2x](/uploads/38dbe0873fa017a917fa562fb45356df/CleanShot_2022-08-03_at_09.00.29_2x.png) | ![CleanShot_2022-08-03_at_09.01.00_2x](/uploads/eb2235b1a554fb7e1de573d375e42b90/CleanShot_2022-08-03_at_09.01.00_2x.png) |\n\n### Resources \u0026 reference\n\n- Explore different type sizes and fonts in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/lostsatellites/pen/BarrNoE).\n- https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/what-minimum-font-size-for-a-high-density-data-web-app-do-you-suggest/\n- https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-03T13:35:05.333Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T22:00:24.911Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T22:00:24.856Z","closed_by":{"id":2799498,"username":"ameliabauerly","name":"Amelia Bauerly","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2799498/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ameliabauerly"},"labels":["foundation::typography","workflow::start"],"milestone":{"id":2453025,"iid":75,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.3","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:28:50.229Z","due_date":"2022-08-17","start_date":"2022-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/75"},"assignees":[{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"}],"author":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1398","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1398","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1398/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1398/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1398","relative":"#1398","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1398"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":112626672,"iid":1395,"project_id":4456656,"title":"GitLab UI stories don't load","description":"GitLab UI stories seem to be unable to load in some cases.

[ ] If you’re making updates or breaking changes to an existing component in the [Pajamas UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/781156790581391771), start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the UI kit. Prefix the branch name with the issue, MR, or epic number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, `#860-table-component-updates-lvanc`. \n1. [ ] When applicable, follow our [structure][structure], [building][building], and [annotation][annotation] guidelines. If you have any questions, reach out to a [Foundations designer][foundations-team].\n1. [ ] Update the link to the working file under the **Figma link** section below.\n1. [ ] If work was not done in a branch (a merged branch will automatically be archived), move your working file \n   to the shared Figma project:\n     1. For Component library changes, move your file to the [**Component archive**][component-archive] project.\n     1. For all other changes, move your file to the [**Misc archive**][misc-archive] project.\n     1. If you’re a community contributor, please consider [transferring ownership of your draft file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040530853) to the maintainer so they can move it to our archive, along with its version history and comments.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ePrior to review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe purpose of these tasks is to ensure consistency with the rest of the components and to save time during the review process. When you are finished with your update, please go through the following clean-up tasks in Figma:\n\n1. [ ] **Canvas**: Make sure no hidden elements have been accidentally left behind. Use **View \u003e Show Outlines** (\u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eY\u003c/kbd\u003e) to reveal invisible objects. Use **View \u003e Zoom to Fit** (\u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003e1\u003c/kbd\u003e) to view all items on the page.\n1. [ ] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.\n1. [ ] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.\n1. [ ] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [ ] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.\n1. [ ] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [ ] **Comments**: Make sure all comments and discussion are resolved.\n\nIf any of these tasks are unclear, see the [Table component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=47785%3A58915) for reference. \n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eRequesting a review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAsk a [Foundations designer][foundations-team] to review your design.\n\n1.

**Foundations** | Foundations represent perceptual patterns. These are less tangible aspects of the design system. Together they create a certain aesthetic for the product. For example, colors, typography, and icons. | Foundational items communicate the opinionated way in which basic visual design attributes, elements, and concepts come together to create a distinct GitLab personality that’s expressed in the UI. For example, color, typography, and iconography. |\n| **Components** | A small design primitive. Components build upon the design foundations (typography, spacing, motion, colors, iconography, etc.) and are the reusable building blocks of the interface. For example, buttons, tabs, and input fields. | A component is a UI element that serves a singular purpose or function. Two or more simple components can combine to form a composite component that still has a single function. For example, an avatar, button, or combobox. |\n| **Regions** | Regions are areas formed by combining multiple components, creating a layout section that can be reused across various pages. For example, the comments and activity feed in issues or merge requests. | _Deprecated_ |\n| **Patterns** | _N/A_ | A pattern combines components and/or content elements into a repeatable, consistent group that has a shared purpose, content association, or both. For example, filtering, forms, or navigation. |\n| **Page templates** | _N/A_ | A template prescribes layout and behavior for a page or common content layout. For example, an issuable, settings, or search results. |\n| **Objects** | Objects capture and organize data as a single source of truth around specific tasks and user interactions. Objects are described in terms of attributes (what they contain), functions (what they do), and relationships (what they interact with). When documented as a conceptual model, objects help understand how the product works and fits together on a system level, detached from the constraints of the user interface. An effective object model tightly aligns our user's mental model with the product's data model. For example, issue, group, and merge request. | An object is a conceptual building block or concept that defines how we think about something independent of its visual representation or interaction model. For example, a job, merge request, or repository. |\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eInformation Architecture (IA)\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### IA\n\n| **Before** | **After** |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/e7416965f7f3a1b0db814c3e8a2bfb87/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/78262d88e192afad89d4e67b01eebca1/image.png) |\n| ![image](/uploads/570c6fa88e0655ab4caf753dd74a3c01/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/fecd2dca3dcd6916f19e71d6b927710d/image.png) |\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n[![Figmacon.svg](/uploads/f326197d14f6fb1e342a1034e12e4386/Figmacon.svg) Working file in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/qYQOk3DhrswWIsRnoUTJ6J/%231378-Pajamas-IA-JE?node-id=0%3A1)\n\n---\n\n## Retrospection\n\n### Good\n* The IA and navigation are being updated and there were some good insights learned.\n\n### Bad\n* This effort took so long that the other KRs didn't get worked on.\n\n### Try\n* Breaking down even smaller.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-21T19:32:21.456Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T18:34:57.138Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T14:28:59.305Z","closed_by":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"labels":["Category:Design System","Pajamas","devops::manage","group::foundations","section::dev","type::maintenance","workflow::design"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"}],"author":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1378","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1378","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1378/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1378/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1378","relative":"#1378","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1378"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":12,"epic":{"id":550542,"iid":12,"title":"FY23 Q3 Foundations OKR: Pajamas scaffolding, structure, and ops","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/-/epics/12","group_id":5387503,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":110282801,"iid":1375,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Pajamas UI Kit \u003e Form component: Update disabled state update (a11y)","description":"## Description\n\nDisabled state of form items does currently not pass ~accessibility in terms of minimum contrast.\\\nThis updates the disabled state of the component to pass ~accessibility \n\n### Proposal\n- Change background color from `#fafafa` -\u003e `$gray-10` (`#f5f5f5`)\n- Update Label from `$gray-400` to `$gray-500` for passing contrast (5.28:1)\n\n| Before | After |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![before](/uploads/552e664cab082df26eaf246f8dd465e4/before.png) | ![after](/uploads/4332494659e7cef1bd46ffe43d991dd7/after.png) |\n| ![contrast_before](/uploads/7f44caa039a948a2c9e0ba37ee2bc2a2/contrast_before.png) | ![contrast_after](/uploads/a94bc76442c9f1b6351ea78b09c61d7d/contrast_after.png) |\n\n### Figma file\n\n[❖ View working file in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/9wDCmYQtWqbclCzhE6k2TJ/Component-library?node-id=49840%3A75722)\n\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n### Assignee tasks:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eGetting started:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n1.

It's these middle guiding layers of the design system that need built out to provide more visual design direction and UI consistency when it comes to implementation.\n\nAt the same time, Pajamas needs a common vernacular with agreed upon definitions and categorization. For example, terms like \"patterns,\" \"organisms,\" and \"regions\" mean different things to everyone and time spent aligning on meaning stifles additions and system maturity. A large part of the initial effort will be to refine the GitLab design language and provide the consistent groundwork that efforts like \"unboxing\" and \"beautification\" — and future ones like them — need to stand on. Pajamas is not just _what_, but _how_, and this is what it means to have a design language and not just a design system. \n\n## Phases\n\n1. **Pajamas scaffolding** (%\"15.2\")\n   - Definitions\n   - Website / design system IA and content mapping\n   - Gap analysis:\n     - Gaps in Pajamas design language\n     - Gaps between Pajamas and product\n2. **Pajamas structure** (TBD)\n   - Website updates: Implement IA changes\n   - SSoT: What would it take to make the Pajamas site the go-to?\n3. **PajamasOps** (TBD)\n   - Storybook: Playground, features, robust layouts, accessibility testing\n   - Figma: Internal plugins, designer efficiency\n   - Triage and contributions\n   - Prioritization\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- Consistency in design execution and user experience\n- Shared design language\n- More informed decisions and contribution\n- Pajamas → Product planning and prioritization\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Pajamas documentation should be prescriptive when necessary, and guiding when not. The aim is not to have a draconian system, but one that provides meaningful constraints to foster collaboration, provide clear and informed guidance, and inspire new possibilities.\n- Refining the design language gives space for efforts like tokenizing and theming to have a meaningful place.\n- Gap analysis helps to define not only what areas need building out, but also the size and impact of gaps between Pajamas and the product. For example, typography is foundational, but not consumed by the product.\n\n## Resources and reference\n\n- [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)\n- [Visual Design Language: The Building Blocks Of Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/visual-design-language-building-blocks/)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-14T23:01:49.627Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T19:28:41.167Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T19:28:41.029Z","closed_by":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"labels":["Category:Design System","type::maintenance","workflow::start"],"milestone":{"id":2453024,"iid":74,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.2","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:24:46.818Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:26:32.010Z","due_date":"2022-07-17","start_date":"2022-06-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/74"},"assignees":[{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"}],"author":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1373","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1373","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1373/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1373/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1373","relative":"#1373","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1373"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":110053010,"iid":1371,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Illustration \u003e Add XS grid size","description":"## Purpose\n\nA new extra small (XS) grid is being added to provide a size that illustration elements can be created at when they're used alongside other UI or to comprise part of a larger design.\n\nFor example, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/794 a \"bidirectional-xs\" illustration is being added to connect two logos.

[x] If you’re making updates or breaking changes to an existing component in the [Pajamas UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/781156790581391771), start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the UI kit. Prefix the branch name with the issue, MR, or epic number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, `#860-table-component-updates-lvanc`. \n1. [x] When applicable, follow our [structure][structure], [building][building], and [annotation][annotation] guidelines. If you have any questions, reach out to a [Foundations designer][foundations-team].\n1. [x] Update the link to the working file under the **Figma link** section below.\n1. [x] If work was not done in a branch (a merged branch will automatically be archived), move your working file \n   to the shared Figma project:\n     1. For Component library changes, move your file to the [**Component archive**][component-archive] project.\n     1. For all other changes, move your file to the [**Misc archive**][misc-archive] project.\n     1. If you’re a community contributor, please consider [transferring ownership of your draft file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040530853) to the maintainer so they can move it to our archive, along with its version history and comments.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ePrior to review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe purpose of these tasks is to ensure consistency with the rest of the components and to save time during the review process. When you are finished with your update, please go through the following clean-up tasks in Figma:\n\n1. [x] **Canvas**: Make sure no hidden elements have been accidentally left behind. Use **View \u003e Show Outlines** (\u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eY\u003c/kbd\u003e) to reveal invisible objects. Use **View \u003e Zoom to Fit** (\u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003e1\u003c/kbd\u003e) to view all items on the page.\n1. [x] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.\n1. [x] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.\n1. [x] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Comments**: Make sure all comments and discussion are resolved.\n\nIf any of these tasks are unclear, see the [Table component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=47785%3A58915) for reference. \n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eRequesting a review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAsk a [Foundations designer][foundations-team] to review your design.\n\n1.

[toast](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toast/#when-to-use) page, on the other hand, says:\n\u003e Provide a contextual message based on a user's action in the same view the action took

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352880#note_961677263), we should use toast notifications to confirm a saved change. \n\nEither way, we should update the Pajamas docs accordingly (toast,

[x] If you’re making updates or breaking changes to an existing component in the [Pajamas UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/781156790581391771), start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the UI kit. Prefix the branch name with the issue, MR, or epic number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, `#860-table-component-updates-lvanc`. \n1. [x] When applicable, follow our [structure][structure], [building][building], and [annotation][annotation] guidelines. If you have any questions, reach out to a [Foundations designer][foundations-team].\n1. [x] Update the link to the working file under the **Figma link** section below.\n1.

For Component library changes, move your file to the [**Component archive**][component-archive] project.\n     1. For all other changes, move your file to the [**Misc archive**][misc-archive] project.\n     1. If you’re a community contributor, please consider [transferring ownership of your draft file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040530853) to the maintainer so they can move it to our archive, along with its version history and comments.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ePrior to review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe purpose of these tasks is to ensure consistency with the rest of the components and to save time during the review process. When you are finished with your update, please go through the following clean-up tasks in Figma:\n\n1. [x] **Canvas**: Make sure no hidden elements have been accidentally left behind. Use **View \u003e Show Outlines** (\u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eY\u003c/kbd\u003e) to reveal invisible objects.

[x] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.\n1. [x] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.\n1. [x] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Comments**: Make sure all comments and discussion are resolved.\n\nIf any of these tasks are unclear, see the [Table component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=47785%3A58915) for reference. \n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eRequesting a review:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nAsk a [Foundations designer][foundations-team] to review your design.\n\n1.

[x] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.\n1. [x] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.\n1. [x] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.\n1. [x] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.\n1.

guidance to the empty state guidelines, establish that it's ok to hide the UI in some occasions but that it needs to be carefully thought through as there are cases when showing the UI, even if there's seemingly nothing to show still makes sense and offers more value to the user and hence produces a better user

\u003e Consider consistent widths for the dropdown panel and inputs","description":"## Problem\n\n\u003c!-- Add a short description of the documentation addition or update. Remember to say why, not just what. --\u003e\n\nCurrently we use inconsistent widths for the dropdown inputs and the dropdown panels. The problems I see:\n\n- Often times the panel width doesn't match the dropdown button or input width\n- The dropdown buttons and inputs are sometimes too long for the content\n\n| The dropdown could match the input in width. | The dropdown could match the dropdown button in width. |\n| ------ | ------ |\n|![image__60_](/uploads/01772f1fddf7728f1151dce5bfaf3bfa/image__60_.png)  | ![image](/uploads/33f92e2a7863589bb685e08ddf111532/image.png) |\n\n| Example in the \"new MR\" page with matching input and dropdown panel width |\n| ------ | \n| ![image](/uploads/d3c584301531d987e7d1b0a02c55481a/image.png) |\n\n## Proposal\n\nI wonder if having set input field widths like `sm` `md` `lg` and `xl` would cover most cases in the product. If we already have fixed sizes for the dropdown button, input, and the dropdown panels, can we make the sizes match so the panel width can be same as the input in most cases?\n\nThe width of the dropdown button or input will be selected based on the average expected input string length, and the dropdown width should match the button/input width, except when the input is shorter than the dropdown panel min width. \n\nIt'd make the input much more consistent visually.\n\n### Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n1.

add-on","description":"\u003c!--\nStart by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:\n   - For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.\n   - For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.\n   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.\n\nTo move a duplicate file:\nOpen the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select\n“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”\n--\u003e\n\n### Description\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1283, the proposal is to move the character counter outside of the textarea bounds. Given that a similar character counter exists as an add-on in the text input, this issue is to help determine if the character counter should be moved outside of the input bounds and treated as help text (which it is), or to remove it altogether if it's unused.\n\n**Note**: The character counter add-on doesn't currently exist in GitLab UI.\n\n### Proposal\n\nTwo options:\n\n1. Remove the character counter from the text input altogether if there are no use cases to support it.\n   - Benefits:\n     - No need to have a build effort in GitLab UI.\n     - Removing unneeded/unused options.\n1. Move the character-counter outside of the input bounds and treat as help text.\n   - Benefits:\n     - More room for content within the input bounds.\n     - Better UX by providing more helpful feedback than just a single number.\n     - More consistency with textarea proposal and use of help text.\n     - Simplification of component both in the UI kit, and in code.\n     - More accessible by providing meaningful feedback outside of the input bounds.\n\n| Option A | Option B* |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![CleanShot_2022-04-04_at_08.59.57_2x](/uploads/e7247028197e4afb335ea9c39c165a2f/CleanShot_2022-04-04_at_08.59.57_2x.png) | ![image](/uploads/f1ca563e3cab0169b40ae5a2de5f839c/image.png) |\n\n\\* Option B could either use a {#/#} pattern or more natural text. Also explored in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1283#proposal.\n\n**Questions**\n\n- Is there anywhere in the product that currently uses a character counter on a text input?\n- Is there a current use case for the character counter that some form of help text wouldn't satisfy?\n\n### Figma file\n\n\u003c!-- Before pasting the link to your Figma file/frame, in the file sharing settings, make sure that “anyone with the link” can view or that a specific user has been invited to the file. --\u003e\n\n[View working file in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/ubxFCR4pADM7ZfMJ7ZvyOU/Component-library?node-id=49840%3A75722)\n\n### Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n1.

Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.\n   - For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.\n   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.\n\nTo move a duplicate file:\nOpen the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select\n“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”\n--\u003e\n\n### Description\n\nReconsider the placement of the character counter text and reconsider how the information can be more clearly conveyed. The current counter shows one number, but doesn't provide any comparison.\n\nAs uncovered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2738#note_896569524, the current placement of the counter collides with both text within the textarea and the scrollbar.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Move the character counter outside of the textarea bounding box.\n- Left align the character counter. This follows other form practices where labels and controls are left aligned and help with scanability.\n- Use either a text explanation of what's happening with the counter, or two values so that the limit is always visible.\n- The character counter is basically help text, so it seems to make sense to treat it as such. Additional help text and any validation messages would be below the character counter.\n- Remove text highlight (adds a lot of development complexity).\n- Only change the color for text when the count has been exceeded. The blue conflicts with text that is linked.\n\n| **Current** | **Option A with {#}/{#}** | **Option B with text** |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/60ce1c2017854ba471fb0035dc0658cb/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/24d0d967ee662bd2ad3c0e1fe2ea63b1/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/5685967d635bcde1e9975bda9ef49221/image.png) |\n\n#### Accessibility considerations\n\n- Visible feedback should also be available/announced for screen reader users. For example, after a pause in typing the limit status is announced via an `aria-live=\"polite\"` region.\n- The placement of the counter could be out of view with screen magnification turned on, but form validation should help with any error remediation. \n\n### Figma file\n\n\u003c!-- Before pasting the link to your Figma file/frame, in the file sharing settings, make sure that “anyone with the link” can view or that a specific user has been invited to the file. --\u003e\n\n[View working file in Figma →](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/ubxFCR4pADM7ZfMJ7ZvyOU/Component-library?node-id=49840%3A75722)\n\n### Checklist\n\nMake sure the following are completed before closing the issue:\n\n1.

conversation:\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nHey Jeremy Elder Nadia Sotnikova \n\nhere's a little bug fix for the 12px icon variants to fix\n- Colour persistence when changing icon\n- Icon persistence when changing variant\n\nThis makes the 12px icon behaviour the same as the 16px icon behaviour.\n\nHowever, it does come with some tradeoffs\n- Lose the 'sensible default' icon for each status\n\nwdyt?\n\nChanges:\n- base components: Rename icon symbol layers\n- base components: Relink icons to icon library\n- variant components: Update to use naming from base component\n- variant components: use the same icon to allow icon change persistence\n\n---\n\nDan MH \"Lose the 'sensible default' icon for each status\" might be a dealbreaker for me. These have specific icon/color relationships that should exist out of the box.\n\n---\n\nJeremy Elder I respect and understand that.\n\nI found this unexpected behaviour when trying to add a badge to the Single Stat - https://www.figma.com/file/17NxNEMa7i28Is8sMetO2H/Data-Visualization?node-id=383%3A72\n\nIt is a pretty high friction process in its current form. And the defaults aren't sensible here.\nTo clarify — my expectation was for these to follow the same persistence rules as 16px icons.\n\nThe good news is, I'm 90% sure there is an alternative way we can set these up:\n- Icon swaps use the right colour\n- Variant (colour) swaps change the icon to the icon defined in the variant. \n\n---\n\nDan MH would you be good with me updating this branch to the latest? It'll include the new tier badge.\n\n---\n\nJeremy Elder I'd prefer to do it so I can remember what the changes were see_no_evil emoji\n\nBut only if we think we will proceed with any of these updates?\n\nOtherwise we can just delete the branch\n\n---\n\n\u003eBut only if we think we will proceed with any of these updates?\n\nI think it's a valid proposal if you're 90% sure it can be done!\nApplied changes from main, so it may have reset the icons here.\n\n---\n\nTo confirm the desired/proposed behaviour:\n\n- 12px icon badges come bundled with an icon\n- Icon changes maintain the correct colour to match the badge pill\n- Changing the colour variant changes the icon to the bundled icon\n\nIf I'm tying myself in knots trying to explain I can jump on a quick sync at some point\n\nOk thats all done, and I think it is an improvement as is. :) \n\nHowever, for many of my use cases the 'sensible defaults' hinder rather than help — so it would be nice to consider changing this behaviour to match the 16px icons in the future!\n\n---\n\nDan MH after some consideration, I don't know that it's helpful to be as prescriptive here.\n\nI had to circle back and through about the ability for you to extend these for your use case, but then that indeed would mean overriding this use case, but this use case is prescriptive and not universal, which isn't what we're going for here. Follow?\n\nSo… I'm up for reworking these to use generic defaults that can be updated at the time of use.\n\nWhat could be helpful, would be adding out instances of the different color/icon/size associations commonly found. Thoughts?\n\n---\n\nThanks for the continued discussion here Jeremy Elder .\n\nHonestly I do see both sides of it.\n\nMy workaround was going to be to create extension of these (and other) symbols that match Optimizes use case and maintain them in an Optimize library.\n\nI don't know what is best for the system and its users. Happy to follow your lead here.\n\nI do think merging as-is would be an improvement, perhaps we could open this conversation wider for the last bit?\n\n---\n\nDan MH Figma is having a tough go at spelling out what the changes are that I'm approving, could you unpack it a little further in the review description when you have a moment?\n\n---\n\nJeremy Elder I've documented it in this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1280\n\nI wasn't expecting this much discussion, otherwise I would have created it sooner :D \n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-30T10:56:41.008Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T10:13:49.949Z","closed_at":"2022-03-31T17:05:18.906Z","closed_by":{"id":4017299,"username":"jeldergl","name":"Jeremy Elder","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4017299/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeldergl"},"labels":["Figma","Pajamas UI Kit","UX","component:badge","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":10593761,"username":"danmh","name":"Dan Mizzi-Harris","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10593761/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/danmh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1281","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1281","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1281/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/1281/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1281","relative":"#1281","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#1281"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
