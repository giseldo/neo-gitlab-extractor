[{"id":86814622,"iid":908,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Pajamas: New UX architecture","description":"## Problem\n\u003c!-- What’s the problem? Why is it worth solving? --\u003e\n### GitLab is a Gardener\nThe great George RR Martin once said...\n\u003e “I think there are two types of writers, the **architects** and the **gardeners**. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.” \n\n*  **Gardener** - Bottom-up, experimental, opportunistic, looking for emerging structures\n*  **Architect** - Top-down, regimented, tightly-controlled, looking to balance the high level with the lower level from the start\n\nI think this mindset can be applied to any creative field (such as design), however, I don't think you necessarily need to be either a `Gardener` or an `Architect`.\n**IMO... GitLab is culturally over-indexing on the `Gardener` side of things.**\n\n### The challenge with being a Gardener\nBased on my onboarding experience and use of Pajamas, this Gardener mindset has led to a number of pain points...\n*  The onboarding experience is scary\n*  Design documentation and resources (from my perspective) are quite diffuse across GitLab\n*  It's hard to quickly understand what GitLab as a product is - and how it fits together\n\n...There is an opportunity to restructure the experience and content of our Pajamas Design System to ease the onboarding experience and architect content in a more noob-friendly way.\n\n## Solution\n\u003c!-- What’s the solution? Why is it like that? What are the benefits?) --\u003e\nLet's introduce just the right amount of `Architect` into our design system...\n\nI have taken a stab at re-architecting the general experience ([see Pajamas Design System - Architecture Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1576610115252/7ba61a8eaf98c494b8d603439d37011757c86b8c?wid=0-1576610284030\u0026outline=open)) - trying to balance a bottom-up *and* top-down approach to a design system. This is WIP and a first iteration of course... I will need input from a broader audience to take into account everything that's important.\n\nSee... \n* [Pajamas: Actionable Principles Update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/797)\n* [Pajamas: Define Conceptual Object Model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/789)\n\n![Screenshot_2019-12-17_at_19.49.56](/uploads/43991241a1584cc752a129b5b3bc4480/Screenshot_2019-12-17_at_19.49.56.png)\n\nWith a more balanced approach to PJ's UX architecture, I believe we can...\n*  Make onboarding easier through clarity \u0026 purpose\n*  Simplify the information architecture of http://design.gitlab.com/ \n*  Provide greater context for our lovely components\n\nThis is very abstract atm... but I will follow up with how this new type of architectural thinking can benefit the new table and sorting components I am working on.\n\nI would love some feedback! Let me know what you think.\n\n/cc

usage of automatic saving for radio buttons might create a brittle user experience","description":"### Problem\n\nMixed usage of automatic saving for radio buttons might create a brittle user experience — as if anything can happen without warning\n\n### Origin\n\n*Follow-up from \"adding radio buttons documentation\" at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/merge_requests/106#note_115355022*\n\nThe question was: Should or should users not expect radio buttons to yield immediate results?\n\n### Further information\n\nI made the case for them not to be (which is backed up by [nngroup](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons/)), but @tauriedavis suggested otherwise (which is backed up by [existing UI in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/uploads/1eba37a0e276c02fd9c8bd96588df112/Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_11.50.46_AM.png)). \n\nhttps://design.gitlab.com/foundations/saving-and-feedback comes into play here as it states we are anticipating saving by default as it has a positive impact on the perceived speed of the application. This is great but there is a potential discrepancies:\n\nDocumented safety measures only account for potential data loss. There is no documentation on how we handle feedback to the user that we will not auto-save data that might have a financial, security, or privacy impact before the user actually interacts with the element.\n\n### Illustrating situations\n\nWhen using radio buttons as an action\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[User clicks element]\nC[System performs action and saving is implied]\n\nA --\u003e C\n```\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRadio button usage done as documented\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[User clicks element]\nB[System saves state]\nC[System gives feedback]\nD[System performs action]\n\nA --\u003e B\nB --\u003e C\nB --\u003e D\n```\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSame situation but now handles sensitive information...\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nZ[user sees element]\nX[user is unsure if information \u003cbr\u003e is saved immediately yes or no \u003cbr\u003e when using the element]\nA[User clicks element]\nB[?]\n\nZ --\u003e X\nX --\u003e A\nA --\u003e B\n```\n\n### Quoted information from sources\n\nfrom https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons\n\n\u003e Use checkboxes and radio buttons only to change settings, not as action buttons that make something happen. Also, the changed settings should not take effect until the user clicks the command button (labeled \"OK\" for example, or \"Proceed to XXX\" where \"XXX\" is the next step in a process).\n\n\u003e  Conversely, violating the standards makes the user interface feel brittle — as if anything can happen without warning. Say, for example, that you assume you can click on a radio button without any immediate impact, and can thus consider your choices after making a selection but before hitting \"OK.\" In such a case, it's jarring when a website violates this standard and unexpectedly moves you to the next page once you enter a selection. Worse, it makes you fear what may happen as you work with forms elsewhere on the site.\n\nhttps://design.gitlab.com/foundations/saving-and-feedback\n\n\u003e Never apply to whole forms (example: adding a personal access token needs a name, expiration date, and access scope; it doesn’t make sense to auto-save the token name field individually). The auto-save method should ideally be only used for data that affects the user editing it. Auto-saving shouldn’t be applied to data that might have financial, security, or privacy impacts, example: changing password or changing the confidentiality of an issue.\n\n\u003e Instant feedback simply means that we show the expected result of a successfully saved change even before that change has actually been saved—we anticipate that the change will be saved successfully so we show it in the UI immediately. This has a positive impact on the perceived speed of the application. An example of a case when a successful result is expected is changing the assignee on an issue.\n\n### How does success look like?\n\nWe prevent the user interface from feeling brittle when using radio buttons — as if anything can happen without warning\n\n### Links/Mentions\n\n@tauriedavis @matejlatin @pedroms (From prior discussion/involvement)\n\ncc: @gitlab\\-com/gitlab\\-ux","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-11-07T23:51:02.749Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T00:35:17.083Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T00:35:17.076Z","closed_by":{"id":516904,"username":"tauriedavis","name":"Taurie Davis","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/516904/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tauriedavis"},"labels":["component:form","component:form-checkbox","component:form-radio-button","workflow::refinement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":489558,"username":"dimitrieh","name":"Dimitrie Hoekstra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/489558/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dimitrieh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/148","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/148","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/148/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656/issues/148/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4456656","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#148","relative":"#148","full":"gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com#148"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":14702839,"iid":124,"project_id":4456656,"title":"Follow-up from \"Resolve \"Component: Add Toast documentation\"\"","description":"The following discussion from !41 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @tauriedavis started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/merge_requests/41#note_105879603):  (+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e Why does the dismiss icon act different if there are 1 vs. 2 lines?\n\n- [ ] @dimitrieh \n\n\u003eI feel we should just do away with dismiss actions.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe text button next to an icon button feels out of place/inconsistent.
