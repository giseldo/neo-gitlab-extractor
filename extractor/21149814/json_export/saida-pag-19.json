https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/merge_requests/612. \n- It should be possible to specify which component should be rendered at which location on the screen with a configuration file\n- Check if golden-layout provides handles / feedback / callbacks to get status updates when positions/sizes of components are changed. These can then be stored back in the preset \n- The screenmanager code should be decoupled from a specific layout manager like golden-layout, in such a way that it remains possible to switch to another layout manager without getting into trouble.\n- Next to golden-layout, React-Grid will be tested for needed functionality\n- How well does the library functions with material design?\n- Opening new browser tabs?\n- Tooling (icons) for closing, moving, dragging elements on screen?\n- Final result is POC in storybook\n\n\n# Examples:

Map: The throttling of parallel loading WMS GetMap is  gradually slowing down","description":"WMImage throttles the amount of simultenous loading of WMS GetMap requests to prevent overload of the WMS server. It seems that this mechanism is not working well. There is a global counter for the number of images currently loading:\nhttps://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/blob/master/libs/core/src/lib/geoweb-webmap/WMImage.ts#L20\n\nIf no images are loading, this counter should be zero. In practice, this counter slowly increases. The effect is that only one image can be loaded in parallel at some point. This slows animations down.\n\nThe other thing is that it might be better to leave this functionality to the browser. Nowadays the browser does probably a better job at throttling than custom JS code.\n\nFix: Remove this throttling mechanism or make it work properly.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-17T11:49:25.311Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T17:01:06.370Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T15:54:40.898Z","closed_by":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander
