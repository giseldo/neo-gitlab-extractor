An additional validation case should be created where the \"probability\" field is required and should have a value of \"PROB30\" or \"PROB40\" and the \"change\" field may be left empty.\n\n\n#### Requirements\nThe changegroup below should be accepted by the openapi specification. In a change group:\n1. The field \"change\" is not empty, the field \"probability\" may be empty\n2. The field \"probability\" is not empty, the field \"change\" may be empty\n3.

At least one of the two should have a value\n\n\n#### Example\nChangegroup causing error:\n```\n {\n        \"probability\": \"PROB30\",\n        \"valid\": {\n          \"start\":
