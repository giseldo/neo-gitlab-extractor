Line: xxx\n\nSpecification:\n- **appType**: [AviMessageConverter, ...otherLibs]\n- **time**: in ISO Time Format\n- **level**: [INFO, ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG]\n- **class**: the Java class in which the log is triggered\n- **message**: the log message should contain a description and the line in code in which it happens.\n\nPart of this ticket is to apply this new format to all logs defined in geoweb-knmi-avi-messageservices (at this moment they are defined as 'log.error','log.info','log.debug','log.warn').\nOff course part of this ticket is also to figure out if the current specified logs are useful or not and if are needed more logs.\n\nNOTE: at this moment the current apache logs are in Kibana at this link\nhttps://kibana.dta.logs.knmi.cloud/_plugin/kibana/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-7d,to:now))\u0026_a=(columns:!(message),filters:!(('$state':(store:appState),meta:(alias:!n,disabled:!f,index:'ecs-apachelog-*',key:docker.container.labels.com_amazonaws_ecs_task-definition-family,negate:!f,params:(query:geoweb-backend-avi-acc),type:phrase),query:(match_phrase:(docker.container.labels.com_amazonaws_ecs_task-definition-family:geoweb-backend-avi-acc)))),index:'ecs-apachelog-*',interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:avi),sort:!())\n\nStill open questions:\n1. Currently 'trace' logs are specified also (as 'log.trace'). What should we do with those?\n2. Can we apply this log format also to other libraries used inside of geoweb-knmi-avi-messageservices, such as fmi-avi-messageconverter, that are slightly out of our control?","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-18T08:36:28.231Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T09:05:32.384Z","closed_at":"2022-02-02T09:05:32.051Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten

useful however are icons. Now, we have some icons with the presets in the hamburger menu and it’s obvious that with every preset added, finding the right icon will be increasingly difficult. So, perhaps it’s better to skip the icons from now? That said, a functional icon representing the configuration of the preset (single view, multiple view, single tiled view, multiple tiled views or a kliko) might be very handy indeed!\n\n- Also, make sure to loop the presets, instead of hardcoding every thing. ScreenPresets already have a title, add a viewType prop (singleView,multiview,singleTileview, multipleTileView) and render the prop to an icon.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-08T08:55:14.894Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T11:52:04.108Z","closed_at":"2021-11-15T11:36:22.354Z","closed_by":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander
