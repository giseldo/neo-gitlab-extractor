doesn't work.\n\nYou can assign `syncGroupsIds: ['Area_satcompDust6h', 'Time_satcompDust6h'],` to both maps but this gets ignored and not set in the store.\n\nI think the problem is caused by the following:\n- the sync groups does a `SYNCGROUPS_ADD_TARGET` to add the maps to the defined syncGroupsIds as mentioned above. \n- then in the reducer it checks if the groupids are already set, they are not so nothing happens\n\nSomehow the groupids mentioned in the preset need to be set as a group `SYNCGROUPS_ADD_GROUP` so the target maps can get set.\n\nProposed solution: `SYNCGROUPS_ADD_TARGET` with a non-existing group should add a group (can be done in the reducer, where there is a check for a non-existing group).","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-17T07:41:29.257Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T10:48:59.123Z","closed_at":"2022-02-22T09:06:25.250Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten

are saved to services store instead of Layers inside them","description":"Currently in LayerSelect, if service has its layers separated to different groups, only the group is added as a layer to the redux store and shown, instead of the actual layers that are inside that group.\n\n* In getCapabilities groups are Layer objects, probably why this is happening. \n* In the old WMSLoader, when adding service to a store through adding a layer to the map, it does work properly and serviceSetLayers action is able to add the real layers to the store.\n* When layers in groups are added correctly, the groups are actually stored inside the layers \"path\" variable, but very badly, groups and subgroups are just put together to one string, without any sign of how many subgroups there are, in this example, there are 3 groups/subgroups for the layer: Fachlayer, Wetter and Warnungen \n\n![image](/uploads/cffd5e7af18420e89535d3b7bf7fb58b/image.png)\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to do couple things:\n* Investigate why serviceSetLayers works differently in LayerSelect compared to WMSLoader and fix it in LayerSelect\n* Refactor layers path variable to have better format, from which different groups can be identified clearly, I suggest renaming it to \"groups\" and having it as a array of strings\n* Either Block groups from appearing in services layers array, or handle them differently by using the leaf variable, which is false for groups and true for layers","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-04T09:47:16.217Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T09:28:31.402Z","closed_at":"2022-02-21T08:22:52.338Z","closed_by":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander

investigate Improve selector memoization to reduce unneccesary renders","description":"Suggestion from Maarten:\n- Create a story with two maps\n- Change the opacity of one of the layers on one map, the other map should NOT rerender\n\nInvestigation for the following:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n**Improve selector memoization to reduce unneccesary renders**\n\n**Description**: Consider mapA and mapB each having a different set of layers. The issue is that changes for a layer in mapA will trigger unneeded renders of mapB. For example when you set opacity for a layer in mapA, mapB (and all other maps) is also re-rendered.\n\n**Problem**: It seems that the getMapLayers selector causes unneeded re-rendering of components. This probably is because the layers are in one redux state object. It is probably difficult for the selector to detect which changes affect what maps.\n\n**Solution**: Make sure that when the result of the selector is unchanged, the component does not re-render. This has to do with memoization and shallow comparison of objects.\n\n**Hint**: From file libs/core/src/lib/store/mapStore/map/selectors.ts, 122: the selector getMapLayers is used in libs/core/src/lib/components/MapView/MapViewConnect.tsx, 86 . It seems that changes in the layers for mapA, will trigger unneeded re-renders for mapB. This becomes an issue when there are many maps in view, like with the multimap component with 18 maps.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-31T08:24:30.168Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T08:26:39.406Z","closed_at":"2022-02-16T15:34:02.178Z","closed_by":{"id":4631074,"username":"loescornelis","name":"Loes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4631074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/loescornelis"},"labels":["Backlog::GeoWebCore","DEV

Performance: Improve selector memoization to reduce unneccesary renders.","description":"**Improve selector memoization to reduce unneccesary renders**\n\n**Description**: Consider mapA and mapB each having a different set of layers. The issue is that changes for a layer in mapA will trigger unneeded renders of mapB. For example when you set opacity for a layer in mapA, mapB (and all other maps) is also re-rendered.\n\n**Problem**: It seems that the getMapLayers selector causes unneeded re-rendering of components. This probably is because the layers are in one redux state object. It is probably difficult for the selector to detect which changes affect what maps. \n\n**Solution**: Make sure that when the result of the selector is unchanged, the component does not re-render. This has to do with memoization and shallow comparison of objects.\n\n**Hint**: From file libs/core/src/lib/store/mapStore/map/selectors.ts, 122: the selector getMapLayers is used in libs/core/src/lib/components/MapView/MapViewConnect.tsx, 86 . It seems that changes in the layers for mapA, will trigger unneeded re-renders for mapB. This becomes an issue when there are many maps in view, like with the multimap component with 18 maps.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-26T10:49:50.307Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T10:48:51.627Z","closed_at":"2022-02-17T10:48:51.389Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"labels":["Backlog::TechnicalDebt","DEV TASK","KNMI"],"milestone":{"id":2445420,"iid":92,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI-sprint61","description":"Cinesat ready for review and integration of react-mosaic","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-31T11:25:40.601Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T08:01:42.324Z","due_date":"2022-02-25","start_date":"2022-02-14","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/92"},"assignees":[{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"}],"author":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/1735","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1735","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1735/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1735/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1735","relative":"#1735","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#1735"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101212508,"iid":1734,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: Performance: layerSetStyles info should belong to service metadata","description":"**layerSetStyles info should belong to service metadata**\n\nIn function setServiceMetadata, in ReactMapView, 355, layerSetStyles are currently set for each individual layer instance.
