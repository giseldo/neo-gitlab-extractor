investigate AWS SAM to run BE locally","description":"Investigate and document on whether we can use SAM to run the lambdas locally for easier testing.\n\nAdd documentation on how to use and set up\n\nFindings:\n- SAM templates are a superset of CloudFormation templates\n- SAM templates can include \"transforms\" that could make the definition of serverless apps more breve\n- The SAM CLI has a `sam local` command that make it possible to run your stack locally, but the number of supported services is very limited (i.e. no S3 support)\n- Because of SAM's limited support I had to include LocalStack for S3 emulation\n- This makes it impossible to just re-use existing CloudFormation templates, so I ended up creating new CloudFormation templates just for development, combined with Bash scripts\n- LocalStack has emulation for some services as well, so I tried that too, without using SAM. CloudFormation support is very limited, so again I found myself creating a new CloudFormation template just for development, combined with Bash scripts\n- It is a painful process and I didn't get a full stack working within one day - I'll stop my investigation on this now and first discuss with the backend people of the team","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-11T12:58:38.831Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T07:59:27.427Z","closed_at":"2022-10-21T07:59:27.184Z","closed_by":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander de Snaijer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5288534/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sanderdesnaijer"},"labels":["Backlog::Backend","DEV TASK","KNMI"],"milestone":{"id":2816012,"iid":139,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI Sprint 78","description":"FE: Finish 2gp LayerSelect, theming sigmet/airmet \r\nBE: SIGMET/AIRMET code improvements and developing AWS locally\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-07T08:59:40.975Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T08:28:46.054Z","due_date":"2022-10-21","start_date":"2022-10-10","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/139"},"assignees":[{"id":11655783,"username":"barthuttinga","name":"Bart Huttinga","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11655783/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/barthuttinga"}],"author":{"id":4631074,"username":"loescornelis","name":"Loes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4631074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/loescornelis"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11655783,"username":"barthuttinga","name":"Bart Huttinga","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11655783/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/barthuttinga"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/2752","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2752","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2752/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2752/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2752","relative":"#2752","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#2752"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":116668126,"iid":2751,"project_id":21149814,"title":"BE: Sigmet cleanup of tests","description":"Structure and clean up tests, split file if necessary.

FastAPI supports asynchronous calls, which makes it potentially faster (in our case we probably would have to use a DB driver that supports async calls to benefit from this)\n- FastAPI requires you to define the structure of incoming/outgoing data and automatically applies validation\n- FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI specs and Swagger dashboard from code\n- I spent 2,5 days on

Discuss our plans regarding vulnerability handling following https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/geoweb-assets/-/issues/2036\n\n\n------\n**Conclusions so far:**\n1. It is **not possible the decrease the vulnerability report to 7 days**\n- For the vulnerability report, the last image in each ECR repository is scanned\n  - If in this image a vulnerability is detected, it is assumed that this vulnerability will be present in the older images in the ECR repository as well.\n  - This assumption is also valid for active containers\n \n2. In between vulnerability reports (every 21 days), the last uploaded ECR images are **scanned once a day** (but a lambda collects the information every hour, see below). The results of these scans are visualized in Grafana\n  - DTA dashboard: https://grafana.dta.logs.knmi.cloud/\n  - PRD dashboard: https://grafana.prd.logs.knmi.cloud/\n  - Attached to these dashboards are alerts set for detecting critical vulnerabilities. This provides alerts in between 21 days of the report\n\n3. After a discussion of our plans, it is discouraged to make security less strict in all pipelines. CPT prefers to have high and/or critical vulnerabilities failing the pipeline (or the thresholds)- this sends a stronger message than letting the pipeline pass \u0026 sending an alert - as it motivates developers to immediately fix the vulnerability.\n  - Regarding vulnerabilities emerging during deployment to production: if vulnerabilities are found in images in development/acc, one can assume that this vulnerability will occur in all images and should be patched before going to PRD as well. \n  - Regarding sending out an alert after a vulnerability has been found during the pipeline: an alert should be sent out within 24 hours when detected via the Grafana dashboard. Therefore, setting the pipeline less strict could be an option, but it might be some additional work to send out an alert via the pipeline if it will also be detected by the Grafana dasbhoard with a short delay.\n\n\n------\nFollow up: make a ticket to discuss how to monitor vulnerabilities in PRD / active containers in the cluster","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-26T08:43:13.027Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T13:44:08.161Z","closed_at":"2022-11-04T13:44:08.113Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"labels":["Backlog::Backend","DEV TASK","KNMI","Sprint::Review \u0026 test"],"milestone":{"id":2821635,"iid":140,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI Sprint 79","description":"Warnings-timeline POC, BE Sigmet/Airmet code improvements \u0026 vulnerability handling","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-11T12:32:58.129Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T09:50:54.078Z","due_date":"2022-11-04","start_date":"2022-10-24","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/140"},"assignees":[{"id":11497801,"username":"m_vanderven","name":"Mizzi van der Ven","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11497801/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_vanderven"}],"author":{"id":4631074,"username":"loescornelis","name":"Loes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4631074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/loescornelis"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11497801,"username":"m_vanderven","name":"Mizzi van der Ven","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11497801/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_vanderven"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/2657","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2657","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2657/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2657/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2657","relative":"#2657","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#2657"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":115762575,"iid":2656,"project_id":21149814,"title":"Service Abstract information usage","description":"On hover show the abstract of a service.
