issue monitoring Bulletin API failure.","description":"On 7/09/2021 we got (continuously from 14 to 21) a strange alert from grafana related to an Error in one of our spaceweather lambdas (BulletinAPI) in PRD environment. \nIt started at 14 when a new bulletin (containing 'error' in the message content) arrived and it ended around 21 when Ernst closed the SpaceWeather PRD application. \n\nAfter an investigation with CPT, the issue have been found in [logstash](https://gitlab.com/KNMI/cloud-platform/monitoring/logstash-config/-/blob/master/pipelines/knmi-geoweb/3002-filter-geoweb-backend.conf) \n\nThe pattern `\"%{GREEDYDATA:log_level} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg}\"`  will make log_level match as much data as possible, in regular expression this is .*, until it finds the last  - . Instead it should only match 1 word: DEBUG, so it should be set to `%{WORD:log_level}`\n\nSuggestions from CPT:\n1. You can try it out for yourself at https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ and using `DEBUG - Successful: {\"message\": {\"overview\": {\"type\": \"ISSUED\", \"simplified_content\": \"- example with dashes - test` as input. Then you see log_level will match much more, while if you use `^%{WORD:log_level} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg}$`  as pattern it doesn't. \n2. [not needed] better to use `^%{WORD:log_level} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg}$`. By adding ^ and $ to the beginning and end the pattern matching will be much easier to process for Logstash, because it knows this expression should not match something halfway the text\n\n**In few words: the continuously alerting was caused by the word 'error' in the content of the message that triggered the error in grafana due to the use of `GREEDYDATA:log_level`.**","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-08T14:24:00.312Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T12:25:52.968Z","closed_at":"2021-09-14T12:25:52.941Z","closed_by":{"id":3401040,"username":"rturtolo","name":"Rocco
