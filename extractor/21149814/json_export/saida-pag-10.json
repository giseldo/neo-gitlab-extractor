The existing `viewpreset` is left unchanged. The `viewpresetauth` endpoint is useful to have, because it will give a 401 unauthorized error if no access token is provided or if something is misconfigured.\n\nYou can check https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud/viewpreset and https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud/viewpresetauth\n\nBy using the command `curl -k --location  https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud/viewpresetauth' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ....'` you can sign in from the command line.\n\n- Nginx https, ssl and generation of self signed certs can be switched off by setting the environment variable`PRESETS_ENABLE_SSL=FALSE`. The http port can be set with `NGINX_PORT_HTTP`. Nginx should not use https by itself when it is deployed behind an AWS elastic load balancer and should only listen to HTTP.\n- Nginx communicates with cognito to get user information based on the OAuth2 Bearer token send with the `viewpresetauth` request. The userinfo endpoint of the identity provider can be set via the `OAUTH2_USERINFO` environment variable.\n- For CORS, nginx needs to know the domain of the frontend. This needs to be set with the `FRONTEND_APP_URL` environment variable.\n- Nginx sets the \"Geoweb-Username\" header for the flask presets backend\n- An endpoint is deployed at https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud (only accessible via connect). \n\nThe cognito userinfo endpoint and the location of the frontend are configured from CI/CD via the OAUTH2_USERINFO and FRONTEND_APP_URL variables. These have been set for dev, tst, acc and prd.\n\n# Solved Issues\n\n- Nginx in the ECS cluster will talk via the KNMI squid proxy with gitlab or cognito. Squid has some quirks, therefore only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 can be used. (Only TLSv1.3 icm gitlab). \n- The EC2 load balancer uses by default the http/2 protocol. When running http/2, it changes all HTTP headers which are forwarded to nginx to lowercase. Disabling http/2 solves this issue. Nginx expect the authorization header to be `Authorization` with strict casing (not `authorization`)\n- Because of CORS, the frontend and the backend needs to match domains. Therefore FRONTEND_APP_URL must be configured, which is the location of the GeoWeb Frontend.\n- In the ECS cluster, nginx needs to be accessed via HTTP. It should be started without the self signed HTTPS certificate. It is now possible to switch this off and run nginx over http. For HTTPS, the Elastic Load Balancer will do the HTTPS offloading and handle the SSL certificates. This can be switched off in nginx by setting the environment variable `PRESETS_ENABLE_SSL=FALSE` and setting the `NGINX_PORT_HTTP` environment variable.\n\nCloses

This can be used in the presets backend to know if someone is signed in.\n\n- This should work with the AWS deployment, possibly in the ELB or the API GateWay\n- This should work for the nginx container used in docker compose\n\nHave a look at https://curity.io/resources/learn/token-sharing/.
