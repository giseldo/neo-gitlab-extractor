Treat cancellations as amendments for TAF","description":"Information from Marcel:\n \n_I tried to find some information on how to “re-cancel” a TAF and what to do with the starttime of the validity of the TAF (either wallclock-hours or original).\nCould not find any information on this use case. Cancelling is often used when there are no observations (e.g. during the nighttime-closure of the field) being made to review the active TAF, This is not the case in the Netherlands (at least not the civilian airports).\nWhen these airports will open in the morning and observations are being made again,  the forecaster will start with a new TAF.\nO yes, we also have a minimum duration of the TAF (should be more than 6 hours).  So de-cancelling is perhaps a non-existing use case.\nThat said, since a cancelled TAF must be coded as an amendment to the previous TAF, a cancelled TAF is no more than an AMD. And for AMD we do have rules, allowing to amend it again (and again, and again). So, I would allow for amending a cancelled TAF, also to avoid deadlocks if a user cancels a TAF by accident.\nThan, the question on what start-time of the the TAF validity needs to have; for this, we can rely on the AMD rules, being that the end-time will stay the same as the original, but the starting time is the intended starttime of the new forecast._","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-10T07:39:37.426Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T13:45:23.516Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T13:45:23.502Z","closed_by":{"id":4964986,"username":"btorrente","name":"Belén Torrente","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb2d4a01ac8e888d1f04b4dd11efc6f6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/btorrente"},"labels":["Backlog::AviationTAF","DEV TASK","KNMI"],"milestone":{"id":2167278,"iid":63,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI-Sprint 47","description":"Holiday cleanup of TAF, theme, and draggables","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-30T12:21:16.546Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T07:06:48.320Z","due_date":"2021-08-13","start_date":"2021-08-02","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/63"},"assignees":[{"id":4964986,"username":"btorrente","name":"Belén Torrente","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb2d4a01ac8e888d1f04b4dd11efc6f6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/btorrente"}],"author":{"id":4964986,"username":"btorrente","name":"Belén Torrente","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb2d4a01ac8e888d1f04b4dd11efc6f6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/btorrente"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4964986,"username":"btorrente","name":"Belén Torrente","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb2d4a01ac8e888d1f04b4dd11efc6f6?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/btorrente"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/1046","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1046","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1046/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1046/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1046","relative":"#1046","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#1046"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":91665767,"iid":1043,"project_id":21149814,"title":"BE: add /populate call to populate templates","description":"Add a call (/populate) to the BE to fill the template for the FE based on the sent notification info.\n\n- type from FE passed is notification as used /store \n- return type is an object with \"title\" and \"message\", both strings\n- Templates can be found here (https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/hLZSzmJYGsQKYkx?path=%2F) if no template available or empty return text \"No template found, please type your own message\".

At KNMI this Notification is stored in the Event table and presented as an Event in the application. KNMI can add information and forward the KNMI Notification (stored in Event table) to DCC. KNMI can also make events on its own.\n\nNote: \n- The incoming notification table is never affected by changes from KNMI, but the Event table is affected.\n- The Event table contains the notification and extracted information from the notification\n\n**Problem**: The event table should become persistent. The format of the events changes during development. How to we get the old events in the newer format? Currently we just throw away the database to prevent errors happening in the backend or frontend due to missing fields.\n\n**Solution A**: Migrate the Event table database by using a backup/restore operation. Make a backup of the Event table and clear it. Run a restore script to add the existing events in the correct format from the backup to the table. Add a manual pipeline in the CI/CD to trigger the execution of the script. The python script is changed according to the changes to the data model. \n- Problem is that the Python code does not have strict typing of the objects, difficult to check if it will write the right format to the table. The other problem is that the Python code does not make use of a shared spaceweather library, and duplicated code might become an issue. \n- Problem is that deployment times can grow out control\n\n**Solution B**: Make our code backwards compatible.\n\nSuggestion: Research ticket to learn about AWS migration. Check how dynamodb tables can be backed up.\n\nExample: For the category we needed to extract extra information from the notification. It is possible to find the right notification by the UUID.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-19T08:03:25.918Z","updated_at":"2021-07-30T13:07:48.211Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T13:07:48.029Z","closed_by":{"id":4964986,"username":"btorrente","name":"Belén
