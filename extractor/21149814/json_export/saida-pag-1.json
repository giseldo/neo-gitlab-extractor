geoweb-adaguc-server: Prevent individual time steps listing in WOWDATA","description":"# Prevent individual time steps listing in WOWDATA\n\nThe GetCapabilities document of the WOWDATA set is huge. See\n\nhttps://adaguc-server-geoweb.geoweb.knmi.cloud/adagucserver?dataset=WOWDATA\u0026service=WMS\u0026request=GetCapabilities\n\n(Currently 3.5 mb)\n\nThis is causing performance issues in opengeoweb, as all these values are loaded into the redux store. We should prevent individual time steps listing in WOWDATA.\n\nWe should configure a interval time configuration in the dataset at:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/geoweb-adaguc-server/-/blob/master/adaguc-config/WOWDATA.xml\n\nThis will list a start/stop/resolution Dimension in the GetCapabilties, thus resulting in a much smaller and more managable file.\n\nIt will probably something like \n\n```\n  \u003cDimension name=\"time\" interval=\"PT5M\"\u003etime\u003c/Dimension\u003e\n```\nfor each layer.\n\nSee https://github.com/KNMI/adaguc-server/blob/master/doc/configuration/Dimension.md for documentation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-04-17T07:00:12.139Z","updated_at":"2023-04-17T11:43:40.355Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T11:43:40.338Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"labels":["Backlog::WMSBackend","DEV TASK","KNMI"],"milestone":{"id":3043892,"iid":176,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI sprint 91","description":"Save a personal workspace","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-27T07:25:21.539Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T06:58:01.292Z","due_date":"2023-04-21","start_date":"2023-04-10","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/176"},"assignees":[{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},{"id":2331238,"username":"ernestopace","name":"Ernst de Vreede","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2331238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ernestopace"}],"author":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/3602","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3602","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3602/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3602/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3602","relative":"#3602","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#3602"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":126661872,"iid":3597,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: Detect changes for workspace presets part 2","description":"Don't use sagas, but use reducer and listen to the following actions and set hasChanges to true:\n\n- [x] updateScreenManagerViews\n- [x] addScreenManagerView\n- [x] deleteScreenManagerView\n- [x] mapPresets/selectMapPreset\n- [x] Syncgroup changes:\n\n      -

Deploy TAF BE - Review Memory and CPU for all containers","description":"Follow-up for this comment: https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/backend-services/aviation-taf-deployment/-/merge_requests/9#note_1349518685\n\n#### Intro:\nAfter all micro-services in the TAF BE have been set up, we should review the CPU and memory allocated for each instances.\n\nDuring deployment of dev-branches, sometimes an issue was encountered that insufficient CPU or Memory was available in the container instances in the KNMI cluster. Therefore, the CPU and memory was decreased for all services.\n\nWith everything set up, review the current settings and see where CPU and/or memory should be decreased or increased. Compare this with the availability in the cluster. Or try another approach\n\n#### Latest configuration:\nPlease note, instead of this configuration, now the entire task was given 1 CPU and 1 GB to share in between.
