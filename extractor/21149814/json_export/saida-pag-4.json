BUG Changing cloudgroup works inconvenient","description":"Related to our capitalization. If you type with shift key pressed, there seems to be no bug. Text should be displayed capitalized. This is default behavor, best way is to not do this, and do the transform to uppercase elsewhere https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/discussions/7867#discussioncomment-2212314\n\nWe need to:\n- remove the `toUpperCase()` in TafFormTextField\n- add `textTransform: 'uppercase'` to the styling\n- ~~- transform all values to uppercase on submit~~ probably can prevent this by doing this on blur\n- transform all values to uppercase on blur\n- let all validations handle lowercase \n\nTo split this\n- we use a lot of `trim` methods before we proceed validating. We can put this in a method that does this and do the uppercase transform. Create this method, and use this on a simple validation method so other tickets can proceed:\n- test driven development, first pick a validation, and update all tests so it handles lowercase. After this fix the now failing validation methods\n- after all validations are in, we can do the uppercase transforming as last and remove the uppercase in the textfield\n\nTip: \n- when developing remove the `toUpperCase()` in TafFormTextField, to see if the input now accepts lowercase. Later we use css to not show the lowercase\n\nCheckList:\n- [x] change\n- [x] clouds\n- [x] probability\n- [x] validField\n- [x] visibility\n- [x] weather\n- [x] wind","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-05T08:11:57.836Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T12:11:09.844Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T12:11:09.771Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"labels":["Backlog::AviationTAF","DEV TASK","KNMI","Sprint::Review \u0026 test"],"milestone":{"id":2983382,"iid":166,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI sprint 87","description":"TAF finishing before going live","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-02-10T08:16:10.041Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T08:03:34.050Z","due_date":"2023-02-24","start_date":"2023-02-13","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/166"},"assignees":[{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander de Snaijer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5288534/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sanderdesnaijer"}],"author":{"id":11497801,"username":"m_vanderven","name":"Mizzi van der Ven","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11497801/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_vanderven"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander de Snaijer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5288534/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sanderdesnaijer"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/3015","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":7},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3015","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3015/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3015/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3015","relative":"#3015","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#3015"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119845927,"iid":3014,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: Clean up TAF code: remove custom isFormDirty","description":"Remove isFormDirty from `useTafModuleContext`, and use formstate.isFormDIrty from react-hook-form inside TafLayout.
