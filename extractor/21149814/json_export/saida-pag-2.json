background tiles: configure cloudfront, caching and enable http/2","description":"The KNMI static background tiles are widely used by KNMI and partners for various projects. Currently these are served directly from a S3 bucket, as static website. It seems dat the expiration time is not set for this way of serving. Without expiration time, the tiles are fetched unnecessary often.\n\nA benefit of adding an expiration time, is that the map view experience will probably be more smooth. By using tiles with an expiration time the map will display with less loading and flickering.\n\nTo enable expiration time, we need to serve the static tiles behind cloudfront. Serving via cloudfront is also considered best practice by AWS.\n\nGoal of this ticket:\n\n* Configure cloudfront in front of the S3 bucket\n* Enable expiration time (Cache-Control)\n* Enable http/2, this seems to be a more efficient protocol to obtain a large number of small files.","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-02-27T13:13:36.167Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T07:13:42.541Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T07:13:42.514Z","closed_by":{"id":11497801,"username":"m_vanderven","name":"Mizzi van der Ven","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11497801/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_vanderven"},"labels":["Backlog::WMSBackend","DEV TASK","KNMI","Sprint::Review \u0026 test"],"milestone":{"id":3036111,"iid":175,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI sprint 90","description":"Wrapping up workspace presets, shareable TAF backend available","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-20T09:42:52.047Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T07:16:27.131Z","due_date":"2023-04-07","start_date":"2023-03-27","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/175"},"assignees":[{"id":2331238,"username":"ernestopace","name":"Ernst de Vreede","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2331238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ernestopace"}],"author":{"id":4631074,"username":"loescornelis","name":"Loes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4631074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/loescornelis"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2331238,"username":"ernestopace","name":"Ernst de Vreede","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2331238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ernestopace"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/3302","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3302","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3302/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/3302/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3302","relative":"#3302","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#3302"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":124355668,"iid":3301,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: Add NOAA National Hurricane Center (NHC) data API to 'BES dashboard' preset","description":"Adding all datalayers to all maps in the BES dashboard is not necessary; these are the selected ones:\n\n* 2/5 day probability Outlook\n* 2/5 day probability Outlook Area.\n* 34kt probabilistic wind\n\nThese layers need to be added to the left map (showing windflags) and the right bottom view (satellite).
