typing for parseFormValues","description":"TafForm - utils:\n\n![image](/uploads/e617db0862729d9ecc0aff549e803310/image.png)\n\n**ISSUES:** Because the type description of the validation field is in two different properties in the TAF object (cavOK and visibility) - the parsing for the form deviates from the way it is done for wind. I also had to adjust `parseFormValues` to be able to remove the visibility property from the object in case CAVOK has been entered. Basically because of the signature of `reduceRowValues` -\u003e `export function reduceRowValues\u003cT\u003e(row: T): T` you can't remove properties from the row you passed in as the type has to be the same coming in as going out. At the same time, I could not have `parseFormValues` accept a TafFormRow type with strings only and return BaseForecast or ChangeGroup type as \"*the types don't sufficiently overlap*\". Keep in mind that if we have cavOK set to true, there should be NO visibility property in the baseforecast/changegroup that is sent to the BE and if we do have a numeric visibility - there should be NO cavOK property sent to the BE.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-04T11:47:48.107Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T15:33:35.578Z","closed_at":"2021-10-04T15:02:07.000Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten
