optimize parselayer function for multimap performance","description":"With the google chrome performance optimizer a profile was made of the application when the slowniness is experienced. This was done with a multimap view with 24 maps. It seemed that the GetCapabilities file was 48 times parsed for the same type of layer. (Same service and layername).\n\nThe issue seems to be in the parsing of the WMS GetCapabilities document. When line WMLayer, 1030 is commented out, the application remains fast.\n\nIt starts with ReactMapview, 399, function wmLayer.parseLayer  and WMJSMap, 1498, function layer.parseLayer. The callback will call the __parseGetCapForLayer function, which in turn will call the layerDoneCallback function. It will return a layer object with properties set based on the getcapabilities. It seems that many seconds are spend in the __parseGetCapForLayer of WMLayer. This parses the jsonified GetCapabilities file and puts certain layer properties.\n\n**Solution**: Re-use the layer object properties for other layers, bypassing the parsing of the getcapabilities file.\n\n- Add a story to core with many maps demonstrating that it works smoothly.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-13T16:35:14.024Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T10:31:20.536Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T07:06:36.043Z","closed_by":{"id":4631074,"username":"loescornelis","name":"Loes","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4631074/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/loescornelis"},"labels":["Backlog::TechnicalDebt","DEV

https://agora.fmi.fi/display/GEOWEB/Screen+Manager+UI+Libs+PoCs) that fulfill at least the requirements defined in https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/geoweb-assets/-/issues/1624\n\nNo implementation in this ticket.\n\nTime box: 3h\n\nCreates new ticket depending on the research results.\n\n\n=============================================\n\n**Results:**\n\nSomeone made an overview of 10 layout libraries:\n- https://morioh.com/p/6ba976ac10f6\n\nHere is a summary for alternatives of golden layout:\n- https://react.libhunt.com/golden-layout-alternatives\n\n**Selected candidates for further research:**\n\n1) **react-mosaic-component**: From this list react-mosaic comes very close to required behavior. The library is available on NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mosaic-component and a demo can be found at https://nomcopter.github.io/react-mosaic/ (demo).\nReact-mosaic has similar functionality as iterm, which was demonstrated by Mikko. The functionality of react-mosaic comes close to what the domain experts requested. It provides full usage of the screen and it allows for resizing panels by shrinking one and automatically enlarging the other. It fully supports react and it does not require jQuery which is a plus. The only drawback is that it uses react-dnd under the hood. This candidate is added to the list on https://agora.fmi.fi/display/GEOWEB/Screen+Manager+UI+Libs+PoCs\n\nFollow up ticket in https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/1588 and https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/1589","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-06T08:15:13.931Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T10:16:56.113Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T10:16:56.090Z","closed_by":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"labels":["Backlog::Screenmanager","DEV TASK","KNMI"],"milestone":{"id":2357698,"iid":82,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI-sprint56","description":"Screenmanager research and improved presets with SatComp animations","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-02T14:40:12.133Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T07:47:14.884Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-12-06","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"}],"author":{"id":3401040,"username":"rturtolo","name":"Rocco Turtolo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3401040/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rturtolo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1999051,"username":"maartenplieger","name":"Maarten Plieger","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1999051/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/maartenplieger"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/1557","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1557","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1557/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/1557/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1557","relative":"#1557","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#1557"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98338373,"iid":1554,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: create snapshots for multi dimension select","description":"The buttons we already have, but not the content.
