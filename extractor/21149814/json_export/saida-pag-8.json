By using a tool like [troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) we could reduce the number of line and make it easier to maintain. Default values are specified only once. First step in the pipeline would be generating the CFN template from a Python script, followed by the usual linting and deployment. We would also get rid of the `sed` replacement in the current template.\n- Investigate alternatives (like [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) and [cdk](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)) for managing CFN templates.\n- The end-goal could be to have completely separate deployments for frontend, Aviation, SpaceWeather, Cognito. To reach this goal we could take the following path:\n   1. Extract monitoring (Grafana) and move to separate repository.\n   1. Extract Cognito userpool generation (for tst, acc, prd) to the newly created [dev-cognito-userpool repository](https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/backend-services/dev-cognito-userpool) like has been done for dev.\n   1. Create separate deployment repository for frontend and point to backend services.\n   1. Create separate code repository and deployment repository for each backend services (Aviation, SpaceWeather), one at a time.\n   1. Optional: create separate deployment repository for triggering deployment pipelines of all the components. In this repo dependencies are managed. Or could this just be the responsibility of the frontend deployment?\n\n**To be discussed**\n\nHow do we manage dependencies and rollbacks? We currently have the possibility to deploy the complete stack from a previous tag. This could become more difficult.\n\nHow do we connect the different stacks? By exporting output values and importing those in another stack. This makes the importing stack dependent on the exporting stack, meaning the latter cannot be deleted without deleting the first. (We have to investigate if updates are problematic.) Or we use `aws cloudformation describe-stacks` inside CI/CD for looking up exported output values and pass those as parameters through the properties files created in .gitlab-ci.yml. The benefit is that stacks can be deleted independently.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-15T07:13:56.744Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T09:10:19.445Z","closed_at":"2022-09-20T13:15:25.688Z","closed_by":{"id":3401040,"username":"rturtolo","name":"Rocco Turtolo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3401040/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rturtolo"},"labels":["Backlog::TechnicalDebt","DEV TASK","KNMI"],"milestone":{"id":2769002,"iid":130,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI-sprint76","description":"GeoJSON support in adaguc, implement snackbar and implement new header and avatar designs.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-08T08:57:57.498Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T12:49:56.706Z","due_date":"2022-09-23","start_date":"2022-09-12","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/130"},"assignees":[{"id":11655783,"username":"barthuttinga","name":"Bart Huttinga","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11655783/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/barthuttinga"}],"author":{"id":11497801,"username":"m_vanderven","name":"Mizzi van der Ven","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11497801/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/m_vanderven"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11655783,"username":"barthuttinga","name":"Bart Huttinga","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11655783/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/barthuttinga"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/2428","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2428","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2428/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2428/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2428","relative":"#2428","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#2428"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":76688,"iid":5,"sequence":3,"group_id":7286989,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-08-15T00:05:03.415Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T00:05:01.946Z","start_date":"2022-09-12","due_date":"2022-09-25","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/iterations/76688"},"health_status":null},{"id":113274035,"iid":2427,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: Theme create Switch button in theme","description":"Create a Switch button we can reuse in theme.
