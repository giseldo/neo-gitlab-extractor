In https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/3289 some properties have been removed, leaving only the `allowedUnits`. Combine with `getAllowedUnits` so you call that one with the productConfig passed in and it extracts the requested allowed units for your form-field directly. \n\n~~Regarding `useProductSettings` as a hook idea, it would be nice to have 1 file that has all values calculated so we don't do it too much, but doing this would make a new provider needed. All Field components now have the productConfig prop, with a provider prop drilling would not be needed. This involves a lot of file and test changes. Currently a lot of methods do a simple thing, and I think that's the way to go for now. If in the end we still want this hook idea, we could do it easier as we have all small methods ready to use in 1 go.~~","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-02-24T14:53:17.410Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T14:05:11.673Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T14:05:11.439Z","closed_by":{"id":5576831,"username":"tvanrijn","name":"Tineke

coding challenge.\n\nExtra information: These are the notes we discussed 14-02-2023:\n\n- Make a list of email adresses of current users (ACC and PRD) (Jan wil do)\n- Make ACC and PRD cognito userpools in https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/backend-services/cognito-userpool (Start February Friday morning 17th)\n- In de week starting 20 February: announce ACC that their accounts are about to change. Inform users that they can re-use the same username/password\n- Keep in mind that the pentest is taking place till March 3rd\n- Configure new ACC and PRD userpools in geoweb-serverless. Deploy new userpool when pentest is done in ACC, probably March 10th.\n- When ACC seems to be OK, announce users in PRD that their account is to change. The PRD userpool can be deployed at normal PRD release (21th of March)\n\n\nFor going to TST:\n- [x] connect presets backend (this will also make smoketest and serverless BE pass)\n    - [x] update presets BE repo readme https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/backend-services/presets-backend/-/merge_requests/64\n    - [x] create new tag for presets BE repo\n    - [x] update deployment BE repo for new tag \u0026 merge https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/backend-services/deploy-presets-backend/-/merge_requests/63\n    - [x] make new release to TST in BE repo\n- [x] make sure smoketest in serverless BE passes, get MR merged https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/geoweb-serverless-backend/-/merge_requests/433\n- [x] contact Jan Koerts for proceeding going to ACC and PRD (MRs for the cognito user manager repo
