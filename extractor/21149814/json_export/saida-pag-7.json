The error returned from the BE (not shown in the dialog): `Error while retrieving event: event not found` and error logged: `Error in PRD grafana: 2022-09-08 10:06:16 Error while retrieving event from the events table: Event not found. Line 386`\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen several notifications in the list until you get a 400 error. It seems to happen quite frequently so no need to open a lot before it happens.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nFrom Ernst:\n\n\u003e I did a quick scan of this problem: it probably is caused by the DynamoDB sometimes returning 0 items for a query, but also telling you to request more results because the query has not finished yet. This surfaces only now because the eventtable has grown above a certain size. We've had similar problems with other queries and fixed all queries, but apparently missed this one. It probably could happen with any type of notification.\n\nResult: opening notifications in the FE should no longer lead to 400 errors - really hard to test in the dev branch as there is not a large database there. Test in dev branch it works as expected and verify once deployed to tst.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-12T07:34:34.083Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T07:32:15.799Z","closed_at":"2022-09-15T07:32:15.547Z","closed_by":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander

but not when editing an existing one\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1. Open new Layer Manager and Layer Select\n2. Add new service and save it\n3. Open serviceOptionsDialog (three dots on right side of horizontal layer list)\n4. Click pen icon to edit the service that was added\n5. Try changing name to a service name that already exists --\u003e this should give warning, and now doesn¬¥t\n6. Try changing name to a service url that already exists --\u003e this should also give a warning, and now doesn¬¥t. This currently only only works after a empty space is added after the whole url is typed\n\nToDo\n\n- Make sure that before service can be saved, checking the name and url from redux works\n- Fix tests to reflect fixes on code","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-09T08:10:57.699Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T15:01:00.283Z","closed_at":"2022-10-06T10:01:54.744Z","closed_by":{"id":5288534,"username":"sanderdesnaijer","name":"Sander de Snaijer","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5288534/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sanderdesnaijer"},"labels":["Backlog::LayerSelect","DEV TASK","FMI","KNMI","MET Norway"],"milestone":{"id":2799783,"iid":134,"group_id":7286989,"title":"JOINT Sprint 2","description":"Layer Select 2GP","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-26T06:32:07.791Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T06:08:58.983Z","due_date":"2022-10-07","start_date":"2022-09-26","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/opengeoweb/-/milestones/134"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":6987988,"username":"PauliSairanen","name":"Pauli Sairanen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6987988/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/PauliSairanen"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/2588","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2588","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2588/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814/issues/2588/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/21149814","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2588","relative":"#2588","full":"opengeoweb/opengeoweb#2588"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":114649357,"iid":2583,"project_id":21149814,"title":"FE: remove snackbarContent from snackbar action","description":"To use the snackbar currently you have to do:\n```\nsnackbarActions.openSnackbar({ snackbarContent: { message } })\n```\nWould be nice to improve:\n```\nsnackbarActions.openSnackbar({ message })\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-08T10:28:43.287Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T12:18:35.790Z","closed_at":"2022-09-09T12:18:35.462Z","closed_by":{"id":753766,"username":"bjornkl","name":"Bj√∏rn Kristian Larsen","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/753766/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bjornkl"},"labels":["Backlog::TechnicalDebt","DEV TASK","KNMI","Sprint::Review \u0026 test"],"milestone":{"id":2752365,"iid":128,"group_id":7286989,"title":"KNMI-sprint75","description":"Finish TAF concurrent editing and Unified GeoWeb version.

(During refinement it was agreed to use a newer version of python)\n  * Additionally, tried to use a fixed version of the vulnerable package db5.3 which was released for `bookworm`\n  * This still marked the package as vulnerable\n \n**Conclusion:**\n* Vulnerability is still marked as high, so the decision was made to whitelist the vulnerable package\n* The new version of python will be kept (python 3.10 instead of 3.9)\n* It seems now that the only way to fix this vulnerability is waiting until a python image with `bookworm` is released\n* In the end, only this [MR](https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/backend-services/presets-backend/-/merge_requests/49) has to be merged (with new python version). The 2nd MR mentioned was created to deploy the dev branch of the presets-be and pass the vulnerability scanning. A third MR (https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/geoweb-serverless-backend/-/merge_requests/332) can be cleaned up.
