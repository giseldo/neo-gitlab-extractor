When selecting the line drawing tool, it becomes active and the cursor changes but upon clicking it reverts. Selecting the line drawing tool again works as expected. Then, after I draw a line with the line drawing tool, the tool is still selected. When I next use it, upon clicking, the currently selected tool reverts to the pencil and I'm therefore not drawing a line anymore. The line drawing tool effectively works every other try.\n\n2.  Sometimes the line drawing tool is not sensitive to my choice of color.\n\n3.  Sometimes the drawn lines are insensitive to undo and redo. If I use the pencil, draw a line, use the pencil, then press revert twice, the pencil drawings disappear and the line is still there.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nTicket created from a Slack [message](https://upchieveaccommunity.slack.com/archives/CE3V4J8KF/p1621022206152500) by [Dave Sudia](https://upchieveaccommunity.slack.com/team/U01B0ATT8AK) in #bug-reporting.\n\ngz#5","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-15T16:05:47.699Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T16:42:40.901Z","closed_at":"2022-05-27T16:42:40.891Z","closed_by":{"id":402962,"username":"thedevelopnik","name":"Dave Sudia","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/402962/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thedevelopnik"},"labels":["type::bug"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":402962,"username":"thedevelopnik","name":"Dave Sudia","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/402962/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/thedevelopnik"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/issues/709","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197/issues/709","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197/issues/709/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197/issues/709/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#709","relative":"#709","full":"upchieve/subway#709"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":148,"epic":{"id":446148,"iid":148,"title":"Bugs to Squash","url":"/groups/upchieve/-/epics/148","group_id":10007222,"human_readable_end_date":"May 8, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":86812005,"iid":705,"project_id":23285197,"title":"Write SessionService function to generate and save heatmap data in cache, and retrieve it from cache","description":"Write the actual function that generates the heatmap data structure according to the API contract spec (#679)\n\nGo through the sessions for the last week, compute wait time, average them for each hour and save it for that hour.\n\nShould include unmatched sessions.\n\nIgnore sessions (matched and unmatched) that lasted less than 1 minute\n\n**To calculate wait time:**\n\nvolunteerJoinedAt -
