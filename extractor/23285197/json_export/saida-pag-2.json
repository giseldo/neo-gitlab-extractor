section of this comment: \nhttps://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/issues/983#note_825175160\n\n- Remove `this.zwibblerCtx.stopSharing()` in https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/blob/main/src/views/SessionView/Whiteboard.vue#L661\n- Remove the `isSessionConnectionAlive` watcher. We don't _need_ to call `joinSharedSession` https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/blob/main/src/views/SessionView/Whiteboard.vue#L751 since Zwibbler will attempt to reconnect to the whiteboard server (as long as we don't call `stopSharing`) and join the collaboration server on its own. Please validate this first with further testing on this behavior. If this cannot be removed, simply put an `await` before `joinSharedSession`. \n- Remove `this.zwibblerCtx.newDocument()` https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/blob/main/src/views/SessionView/Whiteboard.vue#L750, see docs for [newDocument()](https://zwibbler.com/docs/#newdocument)\n\n\n## Tasks\n- [x] Code review\n- [x] Staging smoke tests\n- [x] Merge to main\n- [x] Deploy to prod\n\n## Smoke tests\n- [x] Student/volunteer can login\n- [x] Student/volunteer can make/join session\n- [x] Student/volunteer can use whiteboard and chat in session","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-28T18:21:30.047Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T19:03:41.348Z","closed_at":"2022-02-02T22:41:04.046Z","closed_by":{"id":7303103,"username":"treystevens","name":"Trey Stevens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7303103/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/treystevens"},"labels":["process::in development","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":2446195,"iid":20,"group_id":10007222,"title":"2022Q1S3","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-31T16:58:28.796Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T19:17:18.419Z","due_date":"2022-02-13","start_date":"2022-01-31","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/upchieve/-/milestones/20"},"assignees":[{"id":7303103,"username":"treystevens","name":"Trey Stevens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7303103/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/treystevens"}],"author":{"id":7303103,"username":"treystevens","name":"Trey Stevens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7303103/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/treystevens"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7303103,"username":"treystevens","name":"Trey Stevens","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7303103/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/treystevens"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/issues/987","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":7},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197/issues/987","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197/issues/987/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197/issues/987/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/23285197","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#987","relative":"#987","full":"upchieve/subway#987"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101484466,"iid":986,"project_id":23285197,"title":"Fix document editor text issues","description":"The document editor has text issues because of race conditions with Redis.

who have only completed Algebra as their highest level of math will have to take a separate Algebra 2 quiz to remain certified in `algebraTwo`. These volunteers will have temporary eligibility to help students with Algebra 2 requests until 03/01. Volunteers who have completed levels of math that unlock Algebra 2 [click here for subjects that unlock algebraTwo](https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/blob/main/server/constants/subjects.ts#L114) (Calc BC, Calc AB, precalculus) will not have their `algebraTwo` moved to temporary. It's important to note that, currently, passing an Algebra quiz unlocks both `algebraOne` and `algebraTwo` for volunteers. This data is reflected in one certification on the Volunteer schema, `certifications.algebra`. We have separated out the algebra certifications to `certifications.algebraOne` and `certifications.algebraTwo` in https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/merge_requests/898. Volunteers who were previously certified in `certifications.algebra` should now be certified in `certifications.algebraOne`\n\nWrite migration script to do this:\n- for all volunteers with `algebraTwo` in subjects array\n  -
