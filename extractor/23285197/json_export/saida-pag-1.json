What is possible to pull from app store?\n2. Can we match up the data and determine how many VILS students in-particular downloaded or updated the app not  just total number of downloads?\n3. Is there another way to tell a VILS student user is using mobile app besides them making a request on mobile app?\n4. Is there a benefit of integrating with API?\n5. Can we get % of app downloads that have no activity? \n\n**Some things we can try:**\n1. Maybe we can do logical explanation for why we believe X% of downloads are VILS students\n2. number of downloads from app store minus number of VILS students who have made a request on mobile = non-vils students who have downloaded app\n\n**Note from Dave:**\nSome of this is going to come from Posthog as well, in that we should be able to pull and correlate VILS students from there, by getting the user IDs that take some action there then getting if that ID is a VILS student from the database or adding a new property in Posthog and backfilling it\n\nSlack:

This issue is well documented here https://gitlab.com/upchieve/subway/-/issues/983#note_825196682. TLDR (Too long didn't read): The client sends an \"INIT\" message to the server, but the server never responds to it. This means we actually never try to get the whiteboard document from Azure. We will not be tackling this problem in this ticket. We will instead show the user that we had a problem loading the document. \n2. Zwibbler doesn't load the document when we actually get the whiteboard document from storage\n3. We need to have a fail-safe in case issue #1 happens.
