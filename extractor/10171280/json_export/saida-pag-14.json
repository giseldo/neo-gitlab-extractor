mobile login and registration","description":"The current login and registration process is visually speaking a little flat. This issue relates only to improving the visual aspect of login and registration, and does not include any functional changes.\n\nLatest mobile designs can be found here -\u003e https://design.minds.com/hosted/mobile/michael/mobile%23-registration/\n\n### Notes\n* A continually looping video will play in the background through these screens.\n* When going from one screen to the next, the video state should persist (i.e. it does not restart)\n* When navigating to any screen that contains inputs, the keyboard should activate automatically on the first input\n* The registration page contains only a single password input field (previously two)\n* The CAPTCHA input appears within a drawer that slides up (and not an overlay as it currently is)\n* Currently there are lots of issues within registration when the keyboard is active. The inputs exceed the available space on the screen, and accessing inputs outside of the viewports proves to be quite awkward. The improved designs contained above reduces the likelihood of inputs appearing outside of the viewport, so hopefully this goes some way in improving the registration experience.\n* When defining a password the following popover should appear. Only green ticks should appear as the various criteria are satisfied. The red crosses that are currently implemented, should not appear at all https://design.minds.com/hosted/mobile/michael/mobile%23-registration/#artboard3 \n\nVideo background demo\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1S2oTsaA7vDInGr8Fgx3W5qmPFXVkCIK7/view?usp=sharing\n\nVideo Loop MP4\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1F1ge65Ez_PhoeS_v_8sOTEfrU1wn4S41/view?usp=sharing\n\ncc @msantang78","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-04T10:27:35.812Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T12:51:16.081Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T12:51:16.044Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Platform::Mobile","Priority::1 -
