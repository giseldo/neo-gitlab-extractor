- Bug\" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nUsers can still post more than 5 hashtags on mobile, not matching the front-site. Note this needs to be done for edit too - else a user can bypass it altogether, just adding tags in after. Ideally an error should be shown.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nAdd:\n* Create a post with more than 5 hashtags\n* Save it and see\n\nEdit:\n* Create a post with 5 hashtags\n* Edit it\n* Add another hashtag\n* Save \n\n### Platform information \n\niOS and Android \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe user can have more than 5 hashtags on a post\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe user should NOT be allowed to add a post with, or edit a post so that there are more than 5 hashtags, ideally an error should show to indicate why the user cannot post.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)\n\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-19T13:52:23.412Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T12:47:06.350Z","closed_at":"2019-04-17T12:44:33.187Z","closed_by":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin
