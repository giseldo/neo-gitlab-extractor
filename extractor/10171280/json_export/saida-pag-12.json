comments review","description":"The new comments are looking very good on mobile. Few minor observations are listed below, that would be good to address before releasing the build.\n\nFor reference please see the original designs here -\u003e https://www.sketch.com/s/242fed11-027a-48de-b053-6d4cc89bed75/a/mZq7DV\n\n- [x] The close button (x) is missing from the top-right of the comment area. (#2955)\n- [x] The comment count is not displayed (to the right of comments) (#2954)\n- [x] If the user chooses to close the comments pane by tapping on the outer area at the top of the screen, the elements underneath the overlay are 'tappable'. In this case, the comments pane should disappear only, any the underlying elements shold not be tappable. (#2962)\n- [x] The tappable area on the comment ellipsis is quite small. Could this area be increased, as it takes me multiple attempts to action it.\n- [x] When viewing the comment action sheet, the user should be able to exit the sheet simply by tapping the outer area. Currently the only exit option is to tap 'cancel'. (#2962)\n- [x] Please reduce the line spacing ever so slightly between the channel name and time ago value in the comment. (d741d7062c4b568965c2f322454f5d95522795a8)\n- [x] If in the event there are zero comments on a post, and the user taps the comment icon from within their feed, could we activate the keyboard and focus on the comment input? (dc7038082e8da0fb25682d13f8d26f42890fab34) \n- [x] On the comment input, the tappable area around the ellipsis is very small and should be increased so it is more accessible. (5198a5d4e2dbfed837e19177aa5f5b9d779df2e6)\n- [x] Tapping the ellipsis within the comment inout, launches the media gallery. The intention was to also include 'Mark as explicit' which is currently omitted. Is it still important to include the explicit option when adding a comment @ottman @jotto141 (ref -\u003e https://www.sketch.com/s/242fed11-027a-48de-b053-6d4cc89bed75/a/1avzDp) (#2967)\n- [x] In addition to 'select photo/video from gallery', can we also include an option to 'take picture/video'? (#2967)\n- [x] When viewing a reply to long comment, the following issue is observed. (c8e631ab3ede9aa355ef0295b07688431f336501) ![IMG_1352](/uploads/ac96200358299483bc993e7debb9ad7b/IMG_1352.PNG)\n\n\ncc @markeharding @jotto141 @ottman \nLooks great all round! It should be a big step forward to release the new comments.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-14T08:20:52.813Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T15:59:03.886Z","closed_at":"2021-02-11T15:59:03.655Z","closed_by":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin

Do not display the year, where it is the current year'\n* `Dec 25 2020` = 'Date from the previous calendar year'\n\n2. Post context: When displaying a post outside of a feed, the full date/time should be displayed.\n\n* `Jan 14 2021 · 1:42 am` / `14 Jan 2021 · 17:01`.\n\n(Ideally the date time should be localised accordingly). e.g. FR -\u003e `le 5 avril · 17:01`, DE -\u003e `15.

A single dark-mode screen may be found here: https://www.sketch.com/s/242fed11-027a-48de-b053-6d4cc89bed75/a/aYvzyZ\n\n### Notes\n* Comments should no longer be displayed in a nested fashion. Instead, each level of comments is displayed within its own screen. This approach is clearer, and gives ore screen real estate for comments and comment creation.\n* The term 'comment' applies only to top-level comment items. Anything deeper should simply be referred to as a 'reply'.\n* There are two new filter options related to comments. 'Top' and 'Latest'. Note that these filter options apply only to top-level comments, and not replies.\n  * Top: This is the default selection, where comments with the most up-votes are displayed first.\n  * Latest: Comments arranged from oldest to newest\n* When a user taps on a comment, they are brought to this screen here, where the selected comment is displayed at the very top.
