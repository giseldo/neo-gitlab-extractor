The app can't have a button on it's main navigation bar that automatically sends the user away from the application on the first press without any context. This can affect onboarding by inadvertently bouncing the user away from the app.\n\n### Comparison\n\nFacebook covers this by:\n- Showing directly a modal with the in-app download modal on iOS\n- Showing an informative modal then opening the in-app download modal on Android\n\n### Proposed fix\n\nWe can use the `BottomSheet` to inform the user about the existence of the separate Chat application with the download option on the main action button. If the user choose to download it we can open the in-app download modal or send the user directly to the store/url.\n\n### Future proof\n\nEven if there is a future decision of moving away the chat action from the bottom bar, this behavior is still valid.\n\n### Development\n\nIf there are any extra complications on adding the in-app install modal. Just showing the information sheet should be enough. The BottomSheet should be shown if the user have never pressed the action or doesn't have the app installed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-20T15:10:49.598Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T15:51:14.231Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T15:49:33.683Z","closed_by":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin Santangelo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2900812/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msantang78"},"labels":["Dev-team::Mobile","Impact::1 - High","Platform::Mobile","Priority::1 - High","Product::Chat","Status::InProgress","Team::Platform"],"milestone":{"id":2278931,"iid":198,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Mobile 4.20.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-13T17:17:08.977Z","updated_at":"2022-01-06T09:35:58.342Z","due_date":"2021-11-29","start_date":"2021-10-07","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/198"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":8864731,"username":"rcaferati","name":"Rafael Caferati","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8864731/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rcaferati"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3681","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/3681","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/3681/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/3681/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3681","relative":"#3681","full":"minds/mobile-native#3681"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":37932,"iid":2,"sequence":1,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::2 (Oct 20 - Nov 2, 2021)","description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2021-10-20T22:00:03.208Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T00:05:01.933Z","start_date":"2021-10-20","due_date":"2021-11-02","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/iterations/37932"},"health_status":null},{"id":95801876,"iid":3679,"project_id":10171280,"title":"Improvement: Composer UX","description":"The composer is on the center stage of the content creation and there are a couple basic UX inconsistencies that together can increase it's easiness of use impacting on user retention and the content creation process itself.\n\n- [x] Default to the Text composer when pressing on the BottomTab (+)\n- [x] Default to the Camera composer when pressing on the Story (+) pressable circle\n- [x] Remove the duality of the Photo/Video tabs by merging them into one\n- [x] Use a darkened rounded frame on both dark and light themes\n- [x] Show Post/Story independently from which action the user is coming from\n- [x] Add a label text to the composer story button on the list for increased UI consistency\n- [ ] Invert the position of the cog and submit actions\n- [x] Change the ChevronBack icon with a back action to a unified close (X) one\n\n\u003e This was added as a single issue for it being linked together and having reduced implementation complexity.\n\n**Reasonign**\n\n##### Duality on the tabs Video/Photo\n\nSince the introduction of the Story feature by Snapchat the common user expectation is to have the video activated by long shutter press.

The darkened frame increases it by giving focus to what's shown on the camera. Instagram/Facebook/Linkedin/TikTok apply the rounded corners on iOS and just TikTok on Android. We could maintain the rounded corners for throughout both for consistency.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/782604e155d273fa3e07764689ec0afc/IMG_9996.PNG\" width=\"260\" /\u003e\n\n##### Show Post/Story independently from the action origin\n\nCurrently we're hiding the text option when coming from the story (+) itself.

Instagram is using `Your Story` as label, but also `Add Story`/`Create Story` can be considered.

We can replace it with a single closing action that closes the component. Currently if you are on Text and hit back you would open the camera view.\n\n##### Inverting settings and submit actions\nThis is mainly due for it being positioned closer to the user's finger while typing. It also could have an active color for increased visibility.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-20T14:22:35.599Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T13:53:05.223Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T18:21:45.877Z","closed_by":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin Santangelo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2900812/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msantang78"},"labels":["Dev-team::Mobile","Platform::Mobile","Priority::1 -
