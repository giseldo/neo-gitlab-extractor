These are still very random but I'll reorganize them at a later time.

So I'll list them here first.\n* note: Some of these things (which are the tip of the iceberg) may be considered nit-picky but an elegant UI is all about the details and to make something truly simple one has to do complex things\n* note: In many of these cases the issue may become irrelevant because the parent of those issues may need to be changed.\n\n---\n\n- [x] Splash Screen: first impression matters. The splash screen can be enhanced in a way that the light bulb of the minds logo lights up the whole screen and disappears showing the app content. This also gives more identity to the app. This is just one idea for the splash on top of my head (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3402)\n- [x] Stories: Tapping on the left side of the screen when a video is playing should restart the video (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: Tap and hold should pause videos (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: page indicator should be wider for the active page and fill up according to the video progress. Previous pages should be greyed. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: when stories are active the device shouldn't go to sleep (or when videos are playing) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: Swiping up from a story should show the comments beneath the story and more details like date and views. Instead of having these indicators on the story itself (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: double tapping a story could upvote it. Double tap has become a common gesture for approval (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: share dialog opens too quick. it should open with the same speed as other dialogs (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: stories loading placeholder doesn't start only after the newsfeed items have loaded. The loading should start at the same time as the newsfeed loading (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: Stories UI openning has to have an animation so users aren't confused about the navigation change (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: Stories UI navbar could be simplified (not a fullwidth view) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: Stories UI should be dismissable with a downswipe (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: Photo/Story preview after taking a photo is not good (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/e49acb728ffa6b49db7394a2a8012c90/image.png\" width=\"300px\" /\u003e\n\n- [x] Stories: swiping guide is shown everytime after opening the app. It should be shown only once. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Stories: swiping gesture on stories has to have a shorter activation gesture distance (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)\n- [x] Dialogs: when dialogs open and dim the background, they should also dim the status bar (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3404)\n- [ ] Profile Page: chat button takes a ridiculous amount of time to load \n- [x] Profile Page: chat button opens Minds Chat but doesn't open/create with prompt the direct message with that user (https://gitlab.com/minds/chat-android/-/issues/14)\n- [x] Profile Page: the tip button/icon has a small touchable area. In general icons have to have a larger touchable area than their icon size. This issue is seen throughout the app. including the message icon in profile page, and show more in text contents. (takes some tries to tap correctly) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3405)\n- [x] Profile Page: ellipsis action dialog cancel button's bottom margin is too small \n- [x] Profile Page: Subscribers, subscriptions and views is not in the same line and looks lazy (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3406) \n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/2857bcdf814360e1dd50c7d549724649/image.png\" width=\"300px\" /\u003e\n\n- [ ] I think something has to be done about the icons near the profile. Currently they take too much space, reduce the simplicity of the app, are ambiguous for new users (I still don't understand the airplane icon, and actively thought for some time what the plus icon represented which now I know is minds plus. I'm sure this is common knowledge between old minds users though). I'm not saying they have to be removed but I'm also not crossing that possibility off.\n- [x] Profile Page: Join button is confusing to me. I've so far seen subscribe, follow, and now I see join. I also can't make sense of \"join\"ing for example Bill Ottman (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3406)\n- [x] The Select Dialog is .... (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3407)\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/0cefa2d3c934b63144b1a54c4705cb7a/image.png\" width=\"300px\" /\u003e\n\n- [x] Join Dialog: When selecting USD, the SELECT CARD select box doesn't have horizontal margins\n- [x] Join Dialog: Join membership button has to be full-width and centered. It could also be more attractive.\n- [x] The dollar icon for tipping may need a redesign. I'm thinking tipping is about supporting rather than being about money (which a dollar sign is about). Also showing the tip button with the dollar sign on every post means the user will see the dollar sign a lot. And that unconsciously makes the user think this is all about money (or in other words emphasizes monetary thinking). which is not a helpful mindset for a social media IMO. Also if all posts have a page for themselves, isn't it possible to move the tip button inside the post rather than making it visible on every post? How frequent is tipping? (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3447)\n- [x] Images: Pan to zoom is essential for any social media with pictures IMO. The view image button in the ellipsis is a hack. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3408)\n- [x] Images: view image navbar background color is broken. I'm on dark mode on my phone. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3409)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/b167952fb0715f239a11543958ebb33f/image.png\" width=\"300px\" /\u003e\n\n- [x] Navbar should hide when the user scrolls down and should appear when the user scrolls up (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3410)\n- [x] Aren't material icons boring? anyone? I'm thinking about the possibility of doing a custom redesign of important icons (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3447)\n- [ ] Is there a meaning behind the design of the compose button? I'm just curious\n- [ ] OPINION: minds plus and minds pro are confusing in regard to branding. They even have the same background image.\n- [ ] Newsfeed Activity: Ellipsis button and its actiondialog load very slowly\n- [ ] Newsfeed Activity: name doesn't have touchable feedback\n- [ ] Bonus:\n\n![image](/uploads/f498b240c07ff09556162633c763c21d/image.png)\n- [x] The importance of the buttons of like dislike comment etc. are too much for being seen numerous times in the feed. they are too bold. they have to be thinner, accessible, but not in the eye too much.\n- [x] I tap on a newsfeed post and it opens the stories UI. This is very confusing navigation-wise. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3412)\n- [x] In the Stories UI, I can see a touchable opacity feedback on texts, but there is no onPress action. And the whole text's opacity is reduced on tap which doesn't look very good.\n- [ ] Story animation was laggy on my device. Not too much, but noticable.\n- [x] OPINION: enlarged text when the text content is short is heterogenous with other newsfeed text material and is harder on the eye to read because of larger text (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3413)\n- [x] Videos: there's a black flash before a video is played which is clunky. especially in Stories (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)\n- [x] Videos: the device shouldn't go to sleep when videos are playing (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)\n- [x] Videos: the playing video should stay floating around when navigating minds. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)\n- [x] Videos: video may keep playing in the background when device is locked. this will make listening to long-form content (podcast, interview, event) far easier. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)\n- [x] Minds Chat: splash screen has UI issues in dark mode (https://gitlab.com/minds/chat-android/-/issues/15)\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/436b14f8531d891490ad46c67f75b3e5/image.png\" width=\"300px\" /\u003e\n\n- [x] Camera/compose has to open with animation. It currently has a poor animation and slightly flashes the entire screen white before opening the camera/compose (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3454)\n- [x] Capture button in camera is grey. It should be an active color like blue. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3454)\n- [ ] Slide up animation after the app is opened is unnecessary\n- [ ] I'm confused about the actions of follow and subscribe\n- [ ] I can't select a portion of the text in posts. I can only copy the entire post. The touchable feedback is also unnecessary\n- [x] Open a story/post -\u003e tap on up-votes -\u003e subscribe to someone -\u003e the dialog is closed and weird things happen that I don't understand (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3455)\n- [x] Open a story/post -\u003e tap on up-votes -\u003e unsubscribe from someone -\u003e the dialog is black while the app theme is light (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3424)\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/db786f145e6b135188388d4850046e1e/image.png\" width=\"300px\" /\u003e\n\n- [x] Open a story/post -\u003e tap on up-votes -\u003e tap on a profile and go their profile page -\u003e press home button and leave minds -\u003e open minds again -\u003e the upvotes dialog is opened on the profile page (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3456)\n- [x] Scroll down on main feed -\u003e while scrolling down press on home in tabbar -\u003e the scroll position jumps but the scroll keeps going. What should happen? it should scroll to top with smooth animation and only then start reloading (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3457)\n- [x] Phone number verification \"Send Verification Code\" button doesn't have any validation. u can press it while having the phone number field empty and it says verification code sent to +1. The button is also always grey which doesn't make sense. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3458)\n- [ ] Phone number verification: resend code button doesn't tell me to e.g. wait 2 minutes to get another code. but it has a rate limit so I guess that's fine\n- [ ] JUST WONDERING: Shouldn't the start earning tokens button have a better call to action? shouldn't it be dismissable?\n- [x] Analytics: the tabs aren't scrollable\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/uploads/ab598f8aea5a22976d90aba764cf5d08/image.png\" width=\"300px\"
