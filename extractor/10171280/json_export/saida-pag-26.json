Long Messages not being sent","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"T - Bug\" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nLong messages are not sent, and are lost unless you happen to select all and copy before trying to send.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Send a long message (a few paragraphs worth of text)\n2. It should appear as if the message is sent.\n3. Press the back button\n4. Re-open the chat\n5. Observe your message was not sent \n\n### Platform information\n\nReplicated on Android but I'd imagine it would be universal.\n\n### App version\n\nv3.3.0\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMessage appears to have sent until you leave and rejoin the chat.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe user should be made aware if the message is too long and it should not disappear from the input box after they are warned. Ideally there should be some indicator of how many characters over the limit they are so that they can make necessary amendments.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible
