is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nwhen you tap the @name tag the app struggles to realize it is a link and attempts to do a copy/select/paste, but if you keep tapping, you can sometimes make it link. If there are more than one @name tags in a series like @mark, @john, then it will just highlight the entire bubble\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nshould easily link to the channel
