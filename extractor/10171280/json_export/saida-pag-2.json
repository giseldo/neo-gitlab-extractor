Ideally, we should either keep the user waiting on a splash screen, prevent the unexpected restart, or show a mandatory update prompt. Or a combination of these solutions\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- do a mandatory codepush\n- open the app\n- notice that at some point the app will get restarted\n\n### Platform information \n\nall\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\napp unexpectedly restarts\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nrestart should be controlled. The mandatory update UX should be taken care of\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nN/A\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- if the app is on cold start show a screen showing download or just wait + progress bar\n- if the app is moved to the background or comes to foreground.","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-02-02T10:17:01.334Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T10:02:38.314Z","closed_at":"2023-02-23T17:56:16.178Z","closed_by":{"id":12587544,"username":"valentin129","name":"Vali","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/12587544/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/valentin129"},"labels":["Deployed::Mobile Release","Dev-team::Mobile","Priority::3 -
