Make the subscribers count on the main nav screen a link that will take them to the same page as if they went under their channel and clicked their subscriber list.\n\n- [x] help and support and refer friends should not be on top of nav not. those should be in settings\n\n- [x] wallet icon wrong\n\n- [x] boost icon and wallet icon are backwards\n\n- [x] ditch square green buttons they look out of place. All buttons should be replaced with blue text hyperlinks on light mode. Need to confirm the text button color for dark mode. Confirming with Michael\n\n- [x] logout should only be in settings and should be at bottom of list\n\n- [x] text cut off in push notifications settings on top\n\n- [X] log only errors setting means nothing to anyone (this is getting fixed in the new designs and moved to a developer tools panel in the new settings, nothing to fix here)\n\n- [x] remove the left handed mode activity entirely\n\n- [x] dark mode switcher should really move to the main nav screen in the bottom (in the menu)\n\n- [x] there's a gray background behind the filters on my channel in light mode that shouldn't be there\n\n- [x] the lines between notifications in light mode are way too dark\n\n- [x]  the gallery, photo and video buttons in soon to be legacy composer should not be gray background\n\n- [x] the buttons in blocked channels have the same square button issue. the post button in the composer with the oval make more sense for now until we bring in the new designs everywhere\n\n- [X] be able to swipe out of the nav screen and leave a bit of open space on the far right side.
