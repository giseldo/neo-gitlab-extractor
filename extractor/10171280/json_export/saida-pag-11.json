Note your comment is gone.\n\n### Platform information \n\nReported iOS, replicated Android (S10) likely platform agnostic.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nUser can edit their image post so there are many things that break when they do this.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nDisable editing of already posted images and videos.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or

(https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/DPdZdpy)\n* When tapped the user may either, `Send to` or `Share` - Clicking `share` launches the existing native share drawer (currently access via the ellipsis - note the ellipsis share option should be removed). Clicking `send to` launches a new drawer as shown here https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/dlkMbvZ\n* The most recent chat activity is display in chronological order.\n* The user may search channels https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/g0ARq3g - the exact search logic is undefined, but we should be giving greater weight to channels we follow / follow us, channels with recent chat activity.\n* The user may share only with one group/channel at a time. https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/DPdZYd4\n* When an individual or group is not selected, the send button is disabled.\n* Only when a single group or channel is selected does the send button become activated.\n* When a channel / group is selected, a blue tick will confirm the selection https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/DPdZYd4\n* Tapping on an already selected channel/group will deselect it.\n* Ideally the send action can be completed from within the main Minds App - although in all likelihood this may need to be done within the chat app.\n\ncc @ottman

For me, my password manager 1Password does not show up at all on the login form.\nI suspect there may be issues with other managers too so I'd probably test some of the most common if possible (LastPass, Bitwarden).\n\nThough my issue is login we should also double-check that registration picks up the password generators correctly.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open app from logged out state.\n2. No password manager prompt appears.\n\n### Platform information \n\n* **My device**: Galaxy S10, Android 11, App v4.9.1 \n* **A member (\\@devonmcpherson)** reports similar issues with an iPhone 12 Pro ios 14.4 \n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNo password manager prompt appears.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nPassword manager prompts should appear on login and
