However, the referral link text is currently invisible. (referral link text is same as background color.)\n\nThe problem manifest only when switching from one mode to another. The color of default text do not update correctly.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)\n\nStep 1: On mobile app, switch to dark mode. \nStep 2: Go on sidebar navigation menu, and access settings page. \nStep 3: Go from the settings page to other -\u003e click on referrals page.\nStep 4: On referrals page, view referral links, and you will notice that the css-color of the link is not being changed between light and dark mode.\n\nNote- sometimes this flips, so that light mode is legible, but dark mode is not. See below. \n\n![image](/uploads/0b59e39aaf6efa209d68f56f2736cc5e/image.png)\n\n### Platform information \n\n(Browser, device, system stats, screen size)\n- Mobile apps (React Native, iOS, Android)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n(What actually happens)\n\n![image](/uploads/2be937712b6679f69d2666ed92cabcb9/image.png)\n\n![image](/uploads/a632ed26beed6cff6e3e12f0297d080d/image.png)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n- expected behavior should be white text in dark mode, primary text in light mode.\n\n\n(What you should see instead)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-22T15:13:03.250Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T00:04:31.749Z","closed_at":"2023-04-19T00:04:31.535Z","closed_by":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin Santangelo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2900812/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msantang78"},"labels":["Dev-team::Mobile","Priority::3 - Low","QA::Passed","Severity::3 - Low","Source::Team","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":3049702,"iid":276,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Mob::39 (Apr 5, 2023–Apr 18, 2023)","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2023-03-30T21:34:14.482Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T21:34:25.369Z","due_date":"2023-04-18","start_date":"2023-04-05","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/276"},"assignees":[{"id":749056,"username":"bashynx","name":"Bashy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/749056/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bashynx"}],"author":{"id":13118890,"username":"chints98","name":"Chaitanya Prashant","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aa0c52d58f0022cf59e66420723a41eb?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/chints98"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":749056,"username":"bashynx","name":"Bashy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/749056/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/bashynx"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/4856","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/4856","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/4856/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/4856/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4856","relative":"#4856","full":"minds/mobile-native#4856"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":137,"epic":{"id":44932,"iid":137,"title":"Mobile Planning","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/137","group_id":4326131},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":125598235,"iid":4850,"project_id":10171280,"title":"Boosts not appearing on mobile app","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"T - Bug\" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nBoosts are not appearing on the Newsfeed in the iOS app in the Top posts.
