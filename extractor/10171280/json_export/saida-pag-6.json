It’s much appreciated. \n\u003e \n\u003e I don’t see the option to remove the filter though on my iPhone 12 Pro running 15.3.1. It’s more of an issue because the filter is static. I like the static results while focus is in the group but I’d like to suggest a ‘remove filter’ option in the search box once applied. Also if you leave the group the filter should be wiped. The user could click the box and the option would be the default. That way the results could stay static plus the option to change filter or remove filter would always be present while not requiring any additional screen real estate.\n\nThe issue is that we are not clearing the filter when leaving the screen. \n\n### Test considerations\n\n - Open a group and search for something\n - Go back and open a different group\n - The search field shouldn't be open and it should be empty\n\nThanks\nFretz![EBA58B14-0A91-4F58-B41F-5DCE0FD67F3E](/uploads/eccda40fa489fb33a59b2debced328e6/EBA58B14-0A91-4F58-B41F-5DCE0FD67F3E.png)\n\n![105A4406-5A55-4A92-80EC-CC05F5727782](/uploads/7f6b8f1336f60f13870c94d57ff04ca9/105A4406-5A55-4A92-80EC-CC05F5727782.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-08T01:00:54.443Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T18:44:23.220Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T18:44:23.206Z","closed_by":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin Santangelo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2900812/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msantang78"},"labels":["Deployed::Mobile MR","Priority::3 - Low","Product::Groups","QA::Passed","Severity::1 - Critical","Source::Community","Status::QA","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":2443080,"iid":212,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Dev::12 (Mar 16, 2022 – Mar 29, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-28T22:29:02.864Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T10:54:14.834Z","due_date":"2022-03-29","start_date":"2022-03-16","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/212"},"assignees":[{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin Santangelo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2900812/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msantang78"},{"id":10220813,"username":"tanyatech","name":"Tanya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f21e9a039d1c26114cd0ccac696950cc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tanyatech"}],"author":{"id":5372536,"username":"FretzCapo","name":"Fretz Capo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/226b8b36a9de3f160e6ea2bf67cc5bf1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/FretzCapo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2900812,"username":"msantang78","name":"Martin Santangelo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2900812/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/msantang78"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/4154","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/4154","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/4154/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280/issues/4154/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171280","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4154","relative":"#4154","full":"minds/mobile-native#4154"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":104316188,"iid":4145,"project_id":10171280,"title":"Blank Channel Recommendations See More page","description":"### Summary\n\nSee More Channel Recommendations is empty for a new registered user\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.
