Content Feed","description":"## Tasks\n\n- [x] Create a local store to remember videos that have been seen (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2518)\n- [x] Send `GET` request to return a list of all portrait videos (https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/1690)\n- [x] Filter out videos that have been seen locally (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2518)\n- [x] Submit is_portrait of object:video and activity to elasticsearch (https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/1689)\n- [x] Ability to filter feed by portrait on the backend (https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/1690)\n- [x] Implement a portrait bar component that shows available content\n- [x] Implement a portrait content swiper\n\n## Overview\n\nThe portrait feed is being used as a means to encourage native content (video and images) via the mobile apps. In essence, this implementation is a ‘pseudo-stories implementation’.\n\nFramer Prototype\nhttps://framer.com/share/Portrait-Feed-9BQBZfHLa1fjnokJKiiV\n\nDesign Assets\n[Spec Export - Sketch Measure 2.4](https://design.minds.com/hosted/mobile/michael/mobile%23-portrait-feed/#artboard1)\n\nSome functionality may be open to change.\n\n## Functionality\n* If a user uploads a portrait image or video from the mobile app, it will feature in the portrait content feed, as well as the normal newsfeed.\n* The user contributes via the normal composer.\n* When a user views a portrait piece of content, it is marked as seen.\n* Unseen content will be highlighted within the feed with a yellow stroke\n* Portrait content is displayed within the same UI as the full screen swiper, with in the inclusion of a ‘stepper’ at the top of the image/video.\n* Tapping on a channel within the feed will bring the user to the first unseen post belonging to that user.\n* The user can access the next post by tapping on the right of the screen\n* The user can access the previous post by tapping on the left of the screen.\n* Posts are grouped by channel.\n* Swiping from right - left will bring the user to the next channel (to the first unseen post).\n* Swiping from left-right will bring the user to the previous channel\n* Tapping the `+` icons the left of the channel icons will engage the composer\n* Only content created within the last 48hrs will be displayed within the portrait content feed.\n* When the composer is engaged, the gallery functionality should be removed. The text option from the bottom of the composer should also be removed.\n\n\ncc @ottman @ottman - you may want to run your eyes over the above points. In particular the 'TBC' items.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-07T12:43:41.346Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T12:34:41.054Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T12:34:40.976Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark
