(Currently, I think that's just upvotes.)\n\nThe Friendly Captcha should execute in the background, and not require the user to click anything to execute beyond the initial engagement click.\n\nIf a Friendly Captcha fails, display a toaster message to the user communicating that their engagement looks like spam.\n\n\n\n- In order to implement this task it will be necessary to find a way to use the JS part of the friendly captcha and remove the need for the webview\n\n\n## QA\n\n\u003c!---\nConsideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed\n---\u003e\n\n\n## UX/Design\n\n(Need to define what happens when Friendly Captcha fails. If we're discounting the engagement, we need some transparency for users who may be engaging legitimately but still triggering a captcha failure.)\n\n## Personas\n\n- Users who earn rewards: By discounting inauthentic engagements, engagement rewards for authentic users should increase\n- Token manipulators: By discounting inauthentic engagements, manipulators will have fewer tools for gaming the engagement rewards.\n\n## Experiments\n\nI suggest rolling this out not as an A-B experiment, but in phases where we can understand the impact.\n\n- Phase 1: Execute friendly captchas on all upvotes and log the results, without impacting engagement scores. Use captcha-failed events to analyze the effectiveness of the method on identifying inauthentic engagement, and \n- Phase 2: If we're satisfied with the effectiveness, begin discounting engagements that fail the Friendly Captcha. At this point, we need to transparently communicate to users when it's failed.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Authentic engagements (upvotes) function as they do now -- there is no change to the user experience.\n- [ ] Inauthentic engagements trigger a toaster message disclosing the captcha fail.\n- [ ] Inauthentic engagements are otherwise still recorded.\n- [ ] Visualise to users that their vote is in progress\n- [ ] Still submit failed events\n- [ ] Snowplow 'proof of work' context to be recorded.

push notification for unseen top post","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nThe Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"Type::Feature\" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n## Goal\n\nIncrease content engagement and activity in the mobile app by sending a daily push notification to app users promoting an unseen activity post from their top feed.\n\n## What needs to be done\n\n- Automate a daily push notification personalized per user, promoting an unseen activity post from their top feed\n- Time the push notification at the time of day that user is typically active in the app\n- Add an option to the Notifications setting that allows users to disable this notification (`Top posts`)\n- Be able to measure how often these push notifications are used to launch or engage with the app\n\n| Post type                        | Category | Subtitle | Title

an experiment, targeting 50% of apps users. We want to measure impact on:\n\n- Sessions per user (per week)\n- Engagements per user (per week)\n- Content engagement rate (Tasman is building this metric)\n\nRun first on just android device to compare against iOS.
