user is navigated to the code-based `Verify Account` screen.\n- [ ] When the user is navigated to the code-based `Verify Account` screen, then the user's cursor is automatically positioned in the `Verification code` text field, and the keyboard defaults a numeric layout.\n- [ ] Given the user is on the code-based `Verify Account` screen, and the user inputs an invalid code, when the user taps `Verify` button, then the \"Invalid code\" error is displayed adjacent to the code field.\n- [ ] Given the user is on the code-based `Verify Account` screen, and the user inputs a VALID code, when the

vague and I think can be improved by always having a bit more context.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Enable notifications for `Top Posts`\n- Wait for a daily push top post push notification\n\n### Platform information \n\niOS, Mac + Chrome\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe push notification reads:\n\n\u003e @username posted\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nDepending on the type of post that's being promoted, more context is expected.\n\n| Post type (sample)               | Sample

When the user clicks `Resend` button, then a toaster is displayed with the message `TwoFactor is required`\n2. When closing the 2FA  modal, then a toaster is displayed with the message `TypeError: cannot read properties fo undefined (reading 'status')\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIssue #1:\n\n1. Log into an account that does NOT have app-based 2FA configured\n2. Navigate to Account \u003e Password screen (https://www.minds.com/settings/account/password) on web\n3. Start to change the password by filling in your current password + specifying a new one\n4. Click \"Update Password\" to generate the email 2FA modal\n5. Click the `Resend` button.\n\n----\n\nIssue \\#2:\n\n1. Log into an account that does NOT have app-based 2FA configured\n2. Navigate to Account \u003e Email Address (https://www.minds.com/settings/account/email-address) on web\n3. Change the email to anything else =\u003e fill in your password\n4. When the email 2FA modal pops up, dismiss it\n5. Notice the toast error that says `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')` (img 2)\n\n### Platform information \n\nMacOS + Chrome\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIssue #1:\n- A new verification email is sent, and the modal flashes, and the toaster message `TwoFactor is required` is displayed\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n~- A new verification email is sent and the toaster message communicates that the email was sent.~\n\nHandling in https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5512 - this is a wider issue than just the error message being incorrect.\n\nExpected behavior\n- Get rid of superfluous \"TwoFactor required\" message (as discussed in sprint planning)\n- Fix other error dev error message mentioned above\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\nClicking `Resend` generates `TwoFactor is required` toaster message.\n\n![image](/uploads/03635ef30d63b7ef233d94eece552757/image.png)\n\nClosing the modal generates this toaster message.\n\n![image](/uploads/c00e8f363594f19c948e038ab4ecde55/image.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-05-04T17:28:02.240Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T12:31:24.162Z","closed_at":"2022-05-25T12:31:24.131Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds Gitbot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3427199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mindsgitbot"},"labels":["Deployed::Canary/Production","Dev-team::Front","Priority::3 -

Tasman has identified a common pattern with these users:\n\n- They haven't verified their email address\n- They have multiple events showing them clicking the \"Resend\" button on email verification\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n- Verification emails end up in the user's spam folder and get missed\n- If a user clicks \"Resend\" and later finds the emails in their spam folder, they may follow a verification link in an older verification email -- which will have expired and give them an error.\n\n- [ ] Re-using the same verification link rather than generating a new one every time the user clicks \"resend,\" will result in a higher % of users who register. OR not expiring previous verification links after a new one is sent will have the same effect.\n\n### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?\n\nDaily registrations (email verifications) / Daily signups (new accounts created), can be measured in the [Growth Dashboard](https://analytics.minds.com/superset/dashboard/32/?native_filters=%28NATIVE_FILTER-jhvp9Gs1E%3A%28__cache%3A%28label%3AAuthentic%2CvalidateMessage%3A%21f%2CvalidateStatus%3A%21f%2Cvalue%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%2CextraFormData%3A%28filters%3A%21%28%28col%3Aaccount_type%2Cop%3AIN%2Cval%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%29%29%2CfilterState%3A%28label%3AAuthentic%2CvalidateMessage%3A%21f%2CvalidateStatus%3A%21f%2Cvalue%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%2Cid%3ANATIVE_FILTER-jhvp9Gs1E%2CownState%3A%28%29%29%29).\n\n### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?\n\nCurrently conversion is ~30%; 90%+ seems like a realistic goal for an action with such strong intent as signup.\n\n### Size estimate\n\n(Size estimate -- from Design + Dev -- required to deliver this change.
