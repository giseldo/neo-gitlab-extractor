[{"id":102943207,"iid":2965,"project_id":10152778,"title":"Register modal improvements","description":"We can improve the user experience with the Register modal -- and possibly improve signup conversions -- by addressing these UX issues with the production modal.\n\n[This Figma jam board](https://www.figma.com/file/Tf7tRLoUqUWFADEsoZAaQK/Register-modal?node-id=0%3A1) highlights some of the issues visually.\n\n1. Field validation warnings (e.g. `Must be at least 4 characters long` and `Invalid email`) change the height of the modal when they appear / disappear.\n\n---\n\n2. When inputting a password, the password rules overlay the fields below, including the `Confirm your password` field, making it unclear what the user should do after entering a valid password. (Note: The rules appear to disappear after the rules are successfully met.) On a mobile device, the rules are likely covered by the on screen keyboard.\n\n---\n\n3. On mobile devices, the `Switch to App` prompt overlays the Register modal.\n\n\n### Proposed changes to registration modal\n\n- [ ] Present `Password` and `Confirm Password` always. Currently `Confirm Password` only shows when `password` is not NULL\n- [ ] Always show CAPTCHA. Currently it only shows once passwords have been entered.\n- [ ] Position the captcha image and captcha input side by side as to save space vertically.\n- [ ] Remove / hide the `Switch to App` prompt when modals are displayed.\n- [ ] Reposition validation message to the same row as the form label, saving vertical space.\n- [ ] Remove header image from modal.\n- [ ] Position password rules above the input rather than below.\n- [ ] Check/Update Cypress testing to account for changes.\n\n* Large -\u003e https://www.figma.com/file/ZzhkGGO4ZDjQQfQLGqQEJ5/Marketing-Pages-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=165%3A580\n* Medium -\u003e https://www.figma.com/file/ZzhkGGO4ZDjQQfQLGqQEJ5/Marketing-Pages-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=209%3A508\n* Small -\u003e https://www.figma.com/file/ZzhkGGO4ZDjQQfQLGqQEJ5/Marketing-Pages-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=76%3A859","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-23T17:09:27.898Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T10:26:02.858Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T10:26:02.836Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Priority::1 - High","QA::Failed","Source::Team","Status::Requires Changes","Type::Feature"],"milestone":{"id":2443079,"iid":211,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::11 (Mar 2, 2022 – Mar 15, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-28T22:28:11.088Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T08:23:28.568Z","due_date":"2022-03-15","start_date":"2022-03-02","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/211"},"assignees":[{"id":4508086,"username":"fausto.arci","name":"Fausto Arcidiacono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4508086/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fausto.arci"},{"id":10220813,"username":"tanyatech","name":"Tanya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f21e9a039d1c26114cd0ccac696950cc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tanyatech"}],"author":{"id":9595725,"username":"markryansallee","name":"(Mark) Ryan Sallee","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9595725/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markryansallee"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4508086,"username":"fausto.arci","name":"Fausto Arcidiacono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4508086/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fausto.arci"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/2965","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778/issues/2965","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778/issues/2965/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778/issues/2965/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2965","relative":"#2965","full":"minds/minds#2965"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":204,"epic":{"id":446941,"iid":204,"title":"Growth event","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/204","group_id":4326131,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 15, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102652580,"iid":2958,"project_id":10152778,"title":"Email: Automate bring your friends post for 7 days after registration","description":"## Summary\n\nSend users an email one week after they sign up asking them to refer their friends.\n\n## Conditions\n- User has signed up for an account\n- User has verified their email\n- User has not already referred anyone\n- 7 days have passed\n\n## Subject\nFriends help friends get off big tech\n\n## Preheader\n@{username}, lead the charge to join Minds.\n\n## Copy\n@{username},\n\nWe hope you've enjoyed your first week on Minds!\n\nThe best way to grow the community is by referring your friends, family, and fans. \n\nNot only does each referral grow your network on Minds, it also qualifies you to earn a commission on any tips and membership revenue they earn.

See above design. It does not insert a new suggestion as it did before.\n* It has been advised by @markeharding that the context will not be able for the first iteration of recommendations. This will be addressed moving forward.\n* The sidebar channel recommendation widget should be removed from the newsfeed.\n* Clicking 'See more' will bring the user to `/discovery/suggestions/user`\n* When displaying the description, any line breaks should be removed. There should be a character limit of around 120 characters, allows two lines of text to be displayed on desktop.\n* Where there is no channel description or context, the channel name and avatar should align. See the example of a channel with no description in the figma link above.\n\n* Where a user has zero subscriptions, a single channel recommendation component should be displayed -\u003e https://www.figma.com/proto/c37p1Jz209IT8vRuc1AoFv/Recommendations?page-id=0%3A1\u0026node-id=129%3A2533\u0026viewport=241%2C48%2C1\u0026scaling=scale-down\u0026starting-point-node-id=2%3A981\u0026show-proto-sidebar=1\n\n## Acceptance\n\n### Interaction: Newsfeed has activity posts\n\n- Given the user subscribes to channels with past activity posts,\n- when the user visits the Newsfeed,\n- then the Channel Recommendations component appears after the third activity post in the Newsfeed.\n\n### Interaction: Newsfeed is empty\n\n- Given the user subscribes to NO channels with past activity posts,\n- when the user visits the Newsfeed,\n- then the Channel Recommendations component appears at the top of the Newsfeed, above the Boost Rotator.\n\n### Which channels are recommended (logic)\n\n- Given the user DOES subscribe to other channels...\n  - Include: Channels subscribed to by channels the user subscribes\n  - Filter out: Channels the user already subscribes to\n  - Order by: Prioritize channels by (1) mutual subscribers, (2) total subscribers, and (3) having activity on Minds within the past 7 days\n---\n- Given the user DOES NOT subscribe to other channels...\n  - Include: Channels subscribed to by @minds account\n  - Filter out: None\n  - Order by: Prioritize channels by (1) mutual subscribers, (2) total subscribers, and (3) having activity on Minds within the past 7 days\n\n----\n\nFrom the original Gitlab issue, but now will be separated into another task for another time:\n\n* ~~The same channel recommendation should only be shown once when viewing the newsfeed. If in 'impression 1', @userA is recommended, @userA will not appear in any future impression within that feed.~~\n* ~~It has yet to be determined how frequently we display these impressions. It makes sense to display quite quickly towards the top of the feed, then at wider intervals moving down the feed. e.g. `5th position`, then every 20 positions thereafter. Too many impressions could be quite noisy, so best not to overload the feed.

However, Minds users greatly value their traditional chronological \"Latest\" feeds. So we want to introduce a new default view of the Newsfeed that combines elements of \"Top\" with the traditional \"Latest\" feed.\n\nWe're mindful of potential backlash from a subset of Minds users who don't want the \"Top\" posts summary, so we'll offer them the option to view their old feed. For users who prefer the \"Top\" sorting, we'll give them the option to see a Newsfeed completely organized by \"Top,\" not just the condensed view of the default Newsfeed.\n\n### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?\n\n- Engagement on the Newsfeed (likes, comments)\n- Duration of sessions on the Newsfeed\n\n### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?\n\nUnknown\n\n### How does this change affect the desired metric?\n\nWith the new \"Top\" widget in the default Newsfeed view, we ensure that users see (a) content that they haven't seen before, and (b) content that is most likely to be engaging.\n\n### What counter metric will ensure that an increase in the primary metric is a positive for the product?\n\nWe should measure the % of users who set a preference for the \"Latest\"-only feed, as a measure of dissatisfaction with the new feature.\n\n### Size estimate\n\nUnknown\n\n### WIP Prototype\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/proto/hJWtzurKSdqE1LeznT487N/Newsfeed-%5BWeb%5D?page-id=0%3A1\u0026node-id=3%3A3333\u0026viewport=241%2C48%2C0.5\u0026scaling=min-zoom\u0026starting-point-node-id=3%3A3333","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-24T17:43:49.389Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T13:10:15.673Z","closed_at":"2022-02-25T13:10:15.656Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds Gitbot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3427199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mindsgitbot"},"labels":["Deployed::Canary/Production","Priority::3 - Low","Product::Newsfeed","QA::Passed","Source::Team","Status::QA","Team::Engagement","Type::Feature"],"milestone":{"id":2424693,"iid":209,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::9 (Feb 2, 2022 – Feb 15, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-19T10:33:55.180Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T13:14:41.507Z","due_date":"2022-02-15","start_date":"2022-02-02","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/209"},"assignees":[{"id":879922,"username":"manishoo","name":"Manish","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/879922/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manishoo"},{"id":10220813,"username":"tanyatech","name":"Tanya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f21e9a039d1c26114cd0ccac696950cc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tanyatech"}],"author":{"id":9595725,"username":"markryansallee","name":"(Mark) Ryan Sallee","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9595725/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markryansallee"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":879922,"username":"manishoo","name":"Manish","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/879922/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manishoo"},"user_notes_count":39,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/2917","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778/issues/2917","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778/issues/2917/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778/issues/2917/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10152778","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2917","relative":"#2917","full":"minds/minds#2917"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101161025,"iid":2916,"project_id":10152778,"title":"Visual bugs with latest top feed","description":"- [ ] In Light Mode, the \"Top Feed\" / \"Latest Feed\" labels and the feed toggle icon use the wrong colors\n- [ ] The tooltip highlighting the new feed toggle disappears quickly \u0026 automatically.
