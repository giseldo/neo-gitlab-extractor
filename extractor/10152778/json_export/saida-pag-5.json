testing for emailing campaigns","description":"Each time we change the design/text/timing of emails or notifications we need to measure the performance of the new settings.\n\nThe following steps are necessary to conduct a statistically well-founded A/B testing:\n\n*  **Splitting the user base**\n\n    The user base (or the users that we need to perform the experiment on) needs to be randomly split into disjoint groups, **Control** and **Treatment** (several Treatment groups can be created if needed, each one reflects a particular variant in the settings).\n\n   * The Control group will be targeted using the the old original settings before applying the changes.\n   * The Treatment group will be targeted with the new settings\n\n    Certain level selection can happens before the randomisation to guarantee a more effective testing (e.g. select the users only in the US).\n\n*  **Deciding the performance measure(s)**\n\n    For each experiment, we have to define the performance measure(s) we need to track. Example: in the welcome email, the performance measure could be the convergence rate (i.e. the ratio of users clicked on a link in the email to go to Minds).\n \n*  **Labeling and tracking actions**\n\n    Based on the performance measure(s), we will implement tracking mechanisms that allow us to perform the calculations (e.g. the group of the user and if clicked on a button or not).\n\n    *  Each setting and each user group needs to have a unique descriptor to allow identifying the experiment and measure the performance.\n    *  Each UI element involved in the tracking the performance has to record wether the user interacted with it or not.\n\n    No need to know user guid, we just need to know the group of that user and his actions.\n\n*  **Performing the experiment**\n\n    The more actions performed by the users in both groups the more the statistical significance will be accurate.\n\n    1,000 user participating from each group can be statistically sufficient to make a judgement.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-18T12:20:29.522Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T13:33:05.337Z","closed_at":"2020-06-26T13:33:05.115Z","closed_by":{"id":2350074,"username":"ramialbatal","name":"Rami Albatal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f596b3e3ac1b792fd4f967b20344b26b?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ramialbatal"},"labels":["Priority::2 -

When this post doesn't exist, the notification still comes through. \nThis results in all the notifications prior being erased, making the new notifications unresponsive and rendering the rest of the website unresponsive.\n\nThe notifications below the unassigned boost notification become empty, and the website becomes seemingly unresponsive, whatever you click on won't open. \n\nThe bug seems to be because of the unassigned 'Boost' notification. Because this specific notification is only visible in the 'all notifcation' tab, the other tabs (votes, subscribers, comments etc.) are not affected.\nWhen the unassigned 'Boost' notification gets burried by other notifications, the site will not break unless you load it by scrolling down to it.\n\nTo explain the bug in simple terms:\nWhen you boost a post, you can delete that post. The boost notification will point at a deleted post, find nothing and break the website through the notification system. \nBecause of the way minds caches posts, a deleted post can and will still be processed. After deleting the post you made a timebomb that will break your notification system.\n\n### Steps to reproduce:\n\n1.  Create a media post on your profile (image)\n\n2.  Boost the post on your profile (must be of type Newsfeed)\n\n3.  Delete the post permanently on your profile\n\n4.  Revoke the boosted post in the Boost Console (this will also happen if boost approved or rejected).\n\n5.
