https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#pep-563-postponed-evaluation-of-annotations\n\nThis means that we will no longer need to write annotations as quoted strings when the type is defined later ([example](https://gitlab.com/tildes/tildes/blob/master/tildes/tildes/models/model_query.py#L43)). However, we will have to add a `from __future__ import annotations` to every file where the quoted strings were previously necessary.\n\nThis change won't be possible until pyflakes updates to support it, since using it currently still causes a \"undefined name\" error from Prospector.
