Some of these reports are manifestations of https://gitlab.com/minds/front/issues/1366, users are definitely experiencing a different bug to this.\n\nI believe this to likely be related to state changes on the front-end.\n\nhttps://www.minds.com/newsfeed/994278672455299072\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to a comments thread\n2. Upload the below image\n![wp9](/uploads/1ecc518af51bfd3a35e978b09fac2dca/wp9.jpg)\n3.
