After opening the dropdown, clicking anywhere (the overlay) will navigate to the post.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- The following actions cause navigation instead of their default behavior\n  - dismissing the activity dropdown\n  - dismissing the Quote dropdown\n  - subscribing/unsubscribing from the channel publisher card\n  - clicking See more\n\n- also notice that the activity will keep being highlighted even after moving the cursor outside of the post\n\nPotentially a different issue, but still related to !2002 \n\n- The radius around buttons is small for upvotes, downvotes, comments, reminds, tips and boosts etc, so if you miss by 1-2 pixels, you open modal. We need to introduce a larger clickable area for most buttons on the activity\n- Clicking play on native videos was previously opening modal, now it goes to post page\n- Unlocking NSFW posts\n\n### Platform information \n\nbrowser\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n- clicking on the overlay causes navigation\n- activity is highlighted even though cursor is outside\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n- clicking on the overlay should dismiss the dropdown\n- activity should not be highlighted if the cursor is outside of it\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_10.32.02](/uploads/c52aa752e9b0fc8c3c256e7dd0be8a65/Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_10.32.02.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_10.59.54](/uploads/fcf94360e64d711c826562cf0471faa1/Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_10.59.54.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_11.01.38](/uploads/6fbad57bf25b39854a930b1b8e3322a4/Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_11.01.38.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-06T08:37:29.413Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T11:02:34.546Z","closed_at":"2022-09-09T11:01:25.548Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Ad hoc","Dev-team::Front","Priority::1 -

Here the user can confirm the targeted channel, define an offer amount and currency type.\n    * A user can pay in either tokens or cash.\n    * A user can only pay in cash where the producer has a bank account connected to their minds account.\n    * Where the producer does not have a connected bank account, the consumer will not see a cash option\n  * When a SuperMind request is made, there are a total of four response types. There are:\n    * Any reply (Text)\n    * Video Reply\n    * Image Reply\n    * Remind\n  * It is assumed that Twitter integration will not be required for the first iteration.\n  * Where a minimum offer value is present, a user can not submit a request where the minimum offer has not be satisfied.\n  * Once the user presses ‘Send Request’ a notice will display informing them that the request has been sent and when to expect a reply.\n  * [Responsive mobile composer - prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127\u0026node-id=825%3A17105\u0026viewport=-9081%2C5560%2C1\u0026scaling=min-zoom\u0026starting-point-node-id=825%3A17105\u0026show-proto-sidebar=1)\n  * [Responsive mobile composer](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=866%3A17125)\n\n**Create Request from Activity Post in Feed**\n\n* A new `S` SuperMind icon is to appear within the activity post interactions, replacing tip.
