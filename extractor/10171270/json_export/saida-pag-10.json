It is important that the varied nature of posts is presented as a clear and consistent structure as possible.\n* Boosted content distinguishes itself with a blue border and `Bosted Content` label at the top-left.\n* The total number of boosted posts is displayed top-right.\n* An animated countdown wheel shows when the next post will display. Duration TBC.\n* If the cursor enters any portion of the boosted post container, the posts will not transition. The timer will be *paused* and elapsed timer *set to zero*.\n* If the user starts typing a comment, the timer should be reset and paused.\n* We may introduce some subtle animation between posts, in order to make the change from one post to another less severe. TBC.\n* The first boosted post instance should not be the first item in a users news feed. First occurrence should be the second item.\n* Other instances of the boosted content should be displayed as the user continues to scroll through the newsfeed. Perhaps every 10 newsfeed items. Frequency TBC.\n* Given there will be multiple instances of the scrolling boosted posts, it is important that the user doesn’t see the same boosted content again and again.  The boosted content displayed should be as unique as possible to the user.\n* Given the consistent height of the boosted post container, we need to account for all the various permutations of content that could be displayed. See above InVision link.\n* Any comments are hidden by default.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-20T13:47:06.950Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T21:18:25.339Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T21:18:25.303Z","closed_by":{"id":3341487,"username":"ottman","name":"Bill

Links change on signup - possibly not the case in @eiennohi's hopepage redesigns (need to check).\n2. iPhone href - This is probably going to take some upgraded regex (it thinks the /p in the iphone link is telling it its one of our pages).\n3. https://www.minds.com and https://minds.com.\n\n@medworthy \n\u003e Before logging in, the side bar displays links in example 1. However, when refreshing or returning to the Newsfeed section, example 2 is displayed (note that I have tested this with Quantum and Blink based browsers).\n\n\u003e The iPhone href returns a blank page.\n\n\u003e Also within the minds.com/p pages (ie. dmca, terms, contact, bill of rights etc.), at the top of the left sidebar, there is a similar href (which again, displays the title “IPHONE”) that links to the same URL as above. \n\n\u003e I have also noticed that within the minds.com/p pages, some hrefs refer to URL’s that are prefixed with “https://www.minds.com/”, whilst other hrefs lack the www prefix (ie. “https://minds.com/”). This inconsistency looks unprofessional and needs to be resolved\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)\n\n### Platform information \n\nCross-platform web, tested Quantum and Blink based browsers by @medworthy\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n(What actually happens)\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\n(What you should see instead)\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![Screenshot_20191021_174153](/uploads/5738d25e9da52dae7ad296b55de560d9/Screenshot_20191021_174153.png)\n\nPlease review the following Minds Help and Support post and the corresponding secondary Gitlab ticket.\n\n\u003cb\u003eReference:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n* Associated H\u0026S Enquiry\u003cbr\u003e\nhttps://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1033073486049923072\n\n* Group Based Table Of Contents\u003cbr\u003e\nhttps://www.gitlab.com/minds/front/issues/2132\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)\n\n/label ~\"T \\- Bug\" ~\"S \\- Triage:new\" \n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-21T17:40:48.921Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T14:01:59.095Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T13:43:13.418Z","closed_by":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"labels":["Platform::Browser","Priority::1 - High","Product::Platform","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":1118399,"iid":78,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::01/01 - Xerothermic Xenartha","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-09T14:56:48.456Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T10:25:04.895Z","due_date":"2020-01-14","start_date":"2020-01-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/78"},"assignees":[{"id":3346638,"username":"brianhatchet","name":"Brian Hatchet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3346638/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brianhatchet"},{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},{"id":4581821,"username":"xander-miller","name":"Xander Miller","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a01b987e1227664d83677dbb09eabbe2?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/xander-miller"}],"author":{"id":3351173,"username":"medworthy","name":"Mark Edworthy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3351173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/medworthy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3346638,"username":"brianhatchet","name":"Brian Hatchet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3346638/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brianhatchet"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/2133","time_stats":{"time_estimate":14400,"total_time_spent":34200,"human_time_estimate":"4h","human_total_time_spent":"9h 30m"},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2133","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2133/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2133/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2133","relative":"#2133","full":"minds/front#2133"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26092697,"iid":2128,"project_id":10171270,"title":"Handle implicit Plus subscription from Pro on /plus","description":"Is this a bug?
