But we probably need to specify the return URL and error url. \n\n\n@markeharding and @ottman opening a new tab and keeping our site open might create this situation.  Tab A is minds with the wire dialog. Tab B is the new sendwyre pay functionality. I bet you two dollars that the SendWyre buttons will redirect Tab B back to whatever URL we specify, so that will mean Tab A and Tab B will remain open with our site.\n\nIt might be a smoother experience to open in the original Tab A, but that runs the risk of them closing it. @benhayward.ben is going to test the interaction to verify.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-07T19:03:20.225Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T08:27:02.482Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T08:27:02.412Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Product::Wallet","Source::UserReported","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":1149241,"iid":84,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::04/08 - Fantastic Flamingo","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-07T17:23:47.795Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T10:13:21.241Z","due_date":"2020-04-21","start_date":"2020-04-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/84"},"assignees":[{"id":3346638,"username":"brianhatchet","name":"Brian Hatchet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3346638/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brianhatchet"},{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"}],"author":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3346638,"username":"brianhatchet","name":"Brian Hatchet","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3346638/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brianhatchet"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/2822","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":28800,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":"8h"},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2822","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2822/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2822/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2822","relative":"#2822","full":"minds/front#2822"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":33006821,"iid":2821,"project_id":10171270,"title":"Rollout 2020 Top Discovery Feed Not working","description":"### Summary\n\nTop Discovery Feed doesn't work on the 2020 Rollout\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.
