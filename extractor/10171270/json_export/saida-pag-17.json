What is the difference between the \"SEARCH POSTS\" button and the \"SEARCH MINDS\" button? I'm pretty sure the \"SEARCH POSTS\" button used to display posts which contain the search term(s) in the title or description and the \"SEARCH MINDS\" button displayed a list of channels which have the search term(s) in their display names or usernames. Currently the \"SEARCH MINDS\" button seems to be doing what the \"SEARCH POSTS\" button used to do while the \"SEARCH POSTS\" button is broken.\n\nIt may be that the \"SEARCH POSTS\" feature has been removed and replaced with the \"SEARCH MINDS\" button but if so, it should no longer be appearing in the search drop down menu.\n\nNOTE: Canary mode is turned on.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to the newsfeed.\n2. Type \"test\" into the search box and click the \"SEARCH POSTS\" button.\n\n### Platform information \n\nWindows 10 / Chrome (Version 73.0.3683.86)\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe \"SEARCH POSTS\" button in the search drop down menu doesn't work.
