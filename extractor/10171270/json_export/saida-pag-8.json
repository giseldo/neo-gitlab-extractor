I tried every time I got an email from you.\nthe page that loads after clicking on \"Unsubscribe\" link in the email shows empty @ handle currently. \nIf I have to try once more to unsubscribe from your list, I'll report you to whatever authority this falls under.\nI am sure you realize how bad you look if such simple thing cannot be handled properly by your developers. I have no trust in you as software platform.\n\n\nBrave browser, on android phones, also on different computers. \nThe page after loading says that I am successfully unsubscribed (!) but the handle it displays stays empty in my case. My guess is that using special characters in username is an overkill for your developers. Why do you allow these characters if you dont encode them? Why did no-one write unit tests for these things? Or even worse, did anyone?\nI repeat that i was trying to unsubscribe for probably over a year now - isn't that pretty bad experience?\n\nusername

about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen using a browser that is based on the Blink rendering engine (ie. Chromium based), videos that are using the Minds video player fail to display volume control.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nAccess the following URLs within a Blink based browser.\n\n### Platform information \n\nTested with:\n* Chromium (x86_64 - v79.0 - Blink)\n* Opera (x86_64 - v65.0 - Blink)\n* Brave (x86_64 - v1.0.1 - Blink)\n* Firefox (x86_64 - v70.0 - Quantum)\n* Midori (x86_64 - v69.0 - Webkit)\n\nFirefox and Midori works fine. Chromium, Brave and Opera fails. Suspect that all Blink / Chromium based browsers are affected with this issue.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nVolume control appears and then suddenly disappears, which results in no access to said control / UI element.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nVolume control / UI element should be accessible\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n* https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1068760255372918784\n* https://www.minds.com/media/1069342265038675968\n\n![audiobug](/uploads/004c5f2e690b9e3305ea532a8bc705a8/audiobug.mp4)\n\n### Possible fixes\nSuspect possible CSS issue. Possibly caused by a stylestyle that contains something similar to the following code:\n`.element{display:none;}`\n\nAlternatively, some php or javascript issue which results in the above outcome.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-31T04:44:47.671Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T21:28:21.114Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T21:28:21.042Z","closed_by":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"labels":["Priority::2 - Medium","Product::Video","Source::Community","Source::UserReported","Status::Backlog","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":1149236,"iid":82,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::03/11 - Dedicated Dog","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-07T17:21:46.377Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T17:03:19.943Z","due_date":"2020-03-24","start_date":"2020-03-11","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"}],"author":{"id":3351173,"username":"medworthy","name":"Mark Edworthy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3351173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/medworthy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/2572","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":600,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":"10m"},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2572","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2572/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/2572/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2572","relative":"#2572","full":"minds/front#2572"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30128978,"iid":2514,"project_id":10171270,"title":"Feature flags admin panel","description":"Is this a bug?
