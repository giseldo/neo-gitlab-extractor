My think was that we could display the top three posts, that a user has not yet seen, or if this is not possible, a randomised top three posts.

Once the cache has expired, the query would run again and new posts displayed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-09T09:59:36.018Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T10:42:48.404Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T10:42:48.386Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Dev-team::Front","Priority::2 - Medium","Product::Newsfeed","Source::Team","Status::Follow Up","Team::Engagement","Type::Feature"],"milestone":{"id":2406071,"iid":205,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::7 (Jan 5, 2022 – Jan 18, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-06T09:36:41.718Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T10:20:41.310Z","due_date":"2022-01-18","start_date":"2022-01-05","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/205"},"assignees":[{"id":879922,"username":"manishoo","name":"Manish","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/879922/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manishoo"},{"id":10220813,"username":"tanyatech","name":"Tanya","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f21e9a039d1c26114cd0ccac696950cc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tanyatech"}],"author":{"id":4324284,"username":"michaelfbradley","name":"Michael Bradley","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1521a09312896c9f8a35d1e8e09faa53?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelfbradley"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":879922,"username":"manishoo","name":"Manish","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/879922/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/manishoo"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/4998","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":2},"weight":20,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/4998","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/4998/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/4998/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4998","relative":"#4998","full":"minds/front#4998"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93341989,"iid":4997,"project_id":10171270,"title":"Bring sanity to our modals","description":"Our modal system is very confusing.

shown\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nCan we grab the currency purchased back from Transak? If we cannot we should remove the amount.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/d06aafe8806335ef134abcba4ee990b2/image.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-22T10:15:10.084Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T14:51:12.601Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T14:51:12.581Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Priority::2 -
