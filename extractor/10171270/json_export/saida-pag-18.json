Also, they are allowed to post a comment even if it exceeds the character limit. This causes the comment to get cut off with \"...\" at the point where the character limit was reached.\n\nI suggest making the character limit much longer (like 5000), adding a \"See More\" button after a certain number of characters (like 500) and informing users that their comments have surpassed the character limit by turning the text red and adding a negative number in red (for the number of characters which surpass the character limit) to the bottom right corner of the comment input field plus showing an error message if users try to post a comment which surpasses the character limit.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Post a really long comment, one which exceeds the current character count for comments (whatever it is)\n\n### Platform information \n\nChrome/Win10\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nLong comments are getting cut off (even ones from long ago) and users are not being informed when their comments surpass the character limit. Also, they are allowed to post a comment even if it exceeds the character limit. This causes the comment to get cut off with \"...\" at the point where the character limit was reached.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI suggest making the character limit much longer (like 5000), adding a \"See More\" button after a certain number of characters (like 500) and informing users that their comments have surpassed the character limit by turning the text red and adding a negative number in red (for the number of characters which surpass the character limit) to the bottom right corner of the comment input field plus showing an error message if users try to post a comment which surpasses the character limit.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![11](/uploads/30fafa8ad3e10778c9cef08db6122e55/11.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-01T19:02:33.392Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T17:36:36.533Z","closed_at":"2019-06-11T11:13:21.786Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Priority::1 - High","Product::Comments","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":895281,"iid":22,"group_id":4326131,"title":"sprint: Giddy Giraffe","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-04T15:14:37.104Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T10:06:21.321Z","due_date":"2019-06-19","start_date":"2019-06-05","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/22"},"assignees":[{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"}],"author":{"id":3341806,"username":"JakePassi","name":"Jake Passi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3341806/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JakePassi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/452","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/452","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/452/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/452/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#452","relative":"#452","full":"minds/front#452"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":18713392,"iid":439,"project_id":10171270,"title":"(feat): Search should render inside of new discovery tab","description":"Is this a bug?

Please fix it asap. Every time a new message is received in messenger in real-time it copies the previous 11 or so. It is copying both sent and received messages. I think it's treating it as if it's the first time the chat window has been opened, simply loading the previous 11 sent/received messages but not realizing that those previous messages have already loaded. It should only load the new message(s).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Log in to your primary account in Chrome.\n2. Log in to your secondary account in Firefox.\n3. Send 13 numbered messages (test1, test2, test3, etc.) from your secondary account to your primary account.\n4.

If the password doesn't meet the requirements, you can still click \"SAVE\" which turns blue so long as the passwords match but it will just keep spinning forever.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to settings in the web app.\r\n2. Go down to \"Account Password\" and type in your current password.\r\n3. Type \"minds\" in both new password fields.\r\n4. Click \"SAVE\".\r\n\r\n### Platform information \r\n\r\nChrome/Win10.\r\n\r\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\r\n\r\nNo error message is displayed. The loading icon where the \"SAVE\" button used to be just keeps spinning forever.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\r\n\r\nAn error message should be displayed which reads \"Your new password does not meet the requirements.\" The \"SAVE\" button should not turn blue and should not be clickable until the new password entered into both fields meets the requirements. Also, the question mark icon which displays the password requirements should be present at the right of the \"Your new password\" input field.
