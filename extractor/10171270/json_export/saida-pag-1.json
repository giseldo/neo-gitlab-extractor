if this is a success, continue to migrate images around the site.\n\nhttps://www.landsend.com/ migrated in a lab experiment as saw a 75% increase in LCP - we should definitely experiment to see if we get similar results.\n\n## What needs to be done\n\nImplement new [Angular Image directive](https://angular.io/guide/image-directive) on the homepage - **need to discuss whether this is scoped to both variants of the homepage or just the old one for testing purposes**. This directive is new out of developer preview with Angular 15.\n\nFeatures of note include:\n\n- Intelligent lazy loading based on for example, page visibility\n- fetchPriority control \n- Experimental “fill” mode so that it pre-occupies space\n- Image loader strategies so that correctly sized images are loaded automatically based on the viewport.\n\nWe need to consider what to do with Blurhash and check whether it is compatible, or even needed anymore.\n\n## QA\n\nTest homepage(s?)\n\n## UX/Design\n\nThere should be no design changes\n\n## Mobile\n\n- [ ] Is Mobile Required?\n\n## Personas\n\nInitially targeting an improved experience for crawlers while we learn to use the new directive optimally.\n\n## Experiments\n\nN/A - note though the guest mode experiment controls which homepage that you see for testing.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Learn about the directive via [the docs](https://angular.io/guide/image-directive) - figure out best practices and relay information to the team - possibly add to documentation for bonus points.\n- [x] Explore whether we are in a position without engine changes where we can implement an [image loader strategy](https://angular.io/guide/image-directive#built-in-loaders) which will request images of the correct sizes for the viewport automatically - if this is too big of a task, break it out into another one.\n- [x] Switch the homepages images to use the new image directive, following best practices, and sensible priorities.\n- [x] Determine the best strategy for the homepage for preload hints for SSR and implement.\n- [x] Determine what to do with Blurhash.\n- [x] If it is possible (perhaps through a loader?) have it so that we only have to specify paths to the image in our CDN (are all images through our  CDN?) e.g. `ngSrc=\"/assets/image.jpg\"` rather than currently `[ngSrc]=\"${this.cdnAssetsUrl}/assets/image.jpg\"`.\n\n## Definition of Ready Checklist\n\n- [x] Definition Of Done (DoD)\n- [x] Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Weighted\n- [x] QA\n- [x] UX/Design\n- [x] Personas\n- [x] Experiments","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-02-03T12:00:08.182Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T16:18:15.990Z","closed_at":"2023-03-08T16:18:15.929Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds Gitbot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3427199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mindsgitbot"},"labels":["Deployed::Canary/Production","Dev-team::Front","Priority::2 -

Make sure to unit test to cover this well.\n\n## Definition of Ready Checklist\n\n- [x] Definition Of Done (DoD)\n- [x] Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Weighted\n- [x] QA\n- [x] UX/Design\n- [x] Personas\n- [x] Experiments","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-06T13:04:23.172Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T08:49:59.585Z","closed_at":"2023-01-09T08:49:59.553Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Dev-team::Front","Priority::1 - High","Product::Boost","QA::Passed","Source::Team","Status::QA","Type::Feature","gitbot:backlog-but-no-weight"],"milestone":{"id":2803291,"iid":246,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Dev::31 (Dec 7, 2022–Dec 20, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-28T07:24:16.386Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T09:14:44.727Z","due_date":"2022-12-20","start_date":"2022-12-07","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/246"},"assignees":[{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"}],"author":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5854","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":11,"completed_count":6},"weight":0,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/5854","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/5854/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/5854/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5854","relative":"#5854","full":"minds/front#5854"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":293,"epic":{"id":644898,"iid":293,"title":"Boost: Introduce dynamic pricing to boost","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/293","group_id":4326131,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 5, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119882110,"iid":5853,"project_id":10171270,"title":"Uniqueness verification flow for web","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nThe Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"Type::Feature\" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n## Goal\n\n\u003c!---\nClearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it\n---\u003e\nAs a web user, I should be forwarded to the mobile verification flow so that I can join the reward program.\n\n## What needs to be done\n\n\u003c!---\nClearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above\n---\u003e\nImplement the designs from https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/3604\n\n\n## QA\n\n\u003c!---\nConsideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed\n---\u003e\n\n\n## UX/Design\n\n\u003c!---\nSufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team.

Anything we can do to improve naming consistancy would be very much appreciated on the data side, so if they could regex out all `submit-button`'s, that'd be ideal. This is not neccesarily something easy to do cleanly but a clear definition helps\n  - Bounce the proposal off @michael4tasman and @markryansallee before chiseling the rule into stone.\n- Get rid of `data-minds` section of tag name - it's useless\n- Update existing Codecept / Playwright E2E tests\n- Update existing tags that are not already in use to abide by the convention.\n \n# Definition of Ready Checklist\n\n- [x] Definition Of Done (DoD)\n- [x] Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Weighted\n- [x] QA\n- [x] UX/Design\n- [x] Personas\n- [x] Experiments","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-09T17:22:49.904Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T12:04:12.346Z","closed_at":"2023-01-03T12:04:12.316Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds Gitbot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3427199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mindsgitbot"},"labels":["Deployed::Canary/Production","Dev-team::Front","Priority::2 - Medium","Product::Development","QA::Passed","Source::Team","Status::QA","Type::E2E","gitbot:backlog-but-no-weight"],"milestone":{"id":2803291,"iid":246,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Dev::31 (Dec 7, 2022–Dec 20, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-28T07:24:16.386Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T09:14:44.727Z","due_date":"2022-12-20","start_date":"2022-12-07","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/246"},"assignees":[{"id":3419130,"username":"omadrid","name":"Olivia Madrid","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3419130/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/omadrid"}],"author":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3419130,"username":"omadrid","name":"Olivia Madrid","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3419130/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/omadrid"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5830","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":6},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/5830","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/5830/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/5830/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5830","relative":"#5830","full":"minds/front#5830"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":296,"epic":{"id":650258,"iid":296,"title":"Codecept / Playwright E2E updates","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/296","group_id":4326131,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 20, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118156053,"iid":5822,"project_id":10171270,"title":"Remove 'minds-2263-clustered-recs' and 'minds-2933-channelrecs' experiment flag","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nThe Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"Type::Feature\" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n## What needs to be done\n\n\u003c!---\nClearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above\n---\u003e\n\nRemove 'minds-2263-clustered-recs' experiment flag and cleanup old code\n\n## QA\n\n\u003c!---\nConsideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed\n---\u003e\nTBD\n\n## UX/Design\n\n\u003c!---\nSufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team.
