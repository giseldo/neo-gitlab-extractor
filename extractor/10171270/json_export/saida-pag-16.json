The translate works fine. Also repeated this for Deutsch/German and got the same results.\n\nSo I'd presume there is a common factor linking the two example posts above. One of them has a 'Clover' character that could be messing things up, the other doesn't really appear to have any special characters (plenty of non-English but all pretty standard characters) but is long.\n\nI wonder whether there's an error being thrown and not being reported.\n\n/label ~\"T \\- Bug\" ~\"S \\- Triage:new\" \n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-25T15:21:32.297Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T13:24:14.305Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T13:24:14.203Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Priority::1 - High","Product::Localization","Status::Review","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":881899,"iid":21,"group_id":4326131,"title":"sprint: Funny Frog","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-21T15:56:08.177Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T09:44:48.813Z","due_date":"2019-06-05","start_date":"2019-05-22","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/21"},"assignees":[{"id":1287724,"username":"eiennohi","name":"Marcelo Rivera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b7d099e9c56b3553be6eba6e1c4517d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eiennohi"}],"author":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1287724,"username":"eiennohi","name":"Marcelo Rivera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b7d099e9c56b3553be6eba6e1c4517d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eiennohi"},"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/1156","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/1156","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/1156/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270/issues/1156/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171270","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1156","relative":"#1156","full":"minds/front#1156"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":20315625,"iid":1154,"project_id":10171270,"title":"(fix): moreData set to false when all entities in the subset are unreadable","description":"Is this a bug?

This group loads on the feed automatically for me, others continuously load on the chat. Makes no rhyme or reason. I have found that on iphone I just hold and pull down the feed will load. This is only in browsers and not in the app, btw.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a group called GROUP CHAT DEFAULT, and set the default view to chat.\n2. Create the counterpart FEED CHAT DEFAULT and set the default chat to feed.\n3. Click between the two groups, observe and scroll down.\n\n### Platform information \n\nreported for iPhone Xs iOS 12.2 in Safari. \ntested S7 edge - Android 8.0.0 in Brave.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIt's hard to tell because there is one issue masking things a bit, where it seems if the default is set to feed, it shows the chat until you scroll down.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe default view should just be the one loaded.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)\n\n/label ~\"T \\- Bug\" ~\"S \\- Triage:new\" \n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-13T23:27:48.141Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T12:47:07.364Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T12:12:00.339Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Platform::Browser::Mobile","Priority::1 -
