behavior?\n\nJury process can easily be manipulated by editing flagged post.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nJurors should see a copy of the entire post as the admin say the post when the community guideline strike was given.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/17cf39715209ebee79fa6eb988ff0521/image.png)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nOn the creation of a community guideline strike create a copy of the content for the jury to review so a jury will see exactly what the admin saw when the community guidline strike was given. This archive of violation flagged content could also be useful for future assessments consistency of rule application.\n\nNote the attached backend card to make this possible.\n\nOn the current moderation admin screen, we want to empower the admins to make better decisions by displaying the original offending post and the current version\n- [ ] Display the saved copy on 1323 as \"original\"\n- [ ] Display the current post as \"current\"\n\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-09T14:33:08.309Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T20:45:16.591Z","closed_at":"2020-05-01T10:40:51.875Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark
