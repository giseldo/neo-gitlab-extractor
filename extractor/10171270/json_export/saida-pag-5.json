features for videos shared from Odysee and Rumble, on Minds.\n\nAlso reported previously by @MindsGaming here https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/4109\n\n### Current behavior\n\nIf a user shares an Odysee or Rumble URL via an activity post, we pull in the the thumbnail and headline of the linked video.\n\nIf a user shares an Odysee or Rumble URL via a blog post, we simply display the URL.\n\n### Desired behavior\n\nIf a user shares an Odysee or Rumble URL via an activity post OR a blog post, we display a playable rich embed that allows the user to watch the video on Minds.\n\n### Debug notes\n\nData is there in iFramely but is not displayed on our site.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nPossibly being filtered by anti-XSS measures?\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] When sharing an Odysee or Rumble URL via an activity post, the video is playable from the activity post without having to click off of Minds to another site.\n- [ ] When sharing an Odysee or Rumble URL in a blog post, the URL is replaced with a playable, rich embed that allows a reader to watch the video without having to click off of Minds to another site.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T13:31:26.626Z","updated_at":"2022-12-20T16:04:04.762Z","closed_at":"2022-04-20T09:09:15.636Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds

it creates a copy of the original entity, down to the GUID.\nThis causes strange behaviours around the area of commenting and notifications - if you delete it also breaks things. If you delete the secondary post, it leaves the original post but removes the actual media.\n\nIf you do it with text in the remind box, it actually saves as the description of the new post. It is getting posted to the api/v2/newsfeed/remind/x endpoint.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Make a post with an image\n2. Click timestamp to go to newsfeed page\n3. Remind\n4. Check your channel, see the post is cloned, not a remind.\n5. Mouse over the timestamps to see the guids in the URLs are identical.\n\n### Platform information \n\nInitially reported on iOS Safari tablet \nReplicated Firefox Ubuntu\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nPost is cloned, not reminded\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nReminding should work like everywhere else on the site.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\nv
