Upon attempting to complete the order, they received the error:\n\n\u003e {\"last_name\":[\"can't be blank\"]}\n\nThis prevents the purchase, and resulted in a support ticket. The workaround was for customer to create a customerDot account, and proceed with purchase in the traditional manner.\n\nI'm opening this bug on the gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com project for now because it's not fully clear to me yet where exactly the bug is at, though I suspect it's on the .com side. We can move it as needed.\n\nMy suspicion that this is a .com bug is based on a few factors:\n\n1. [Quite some time ago](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13661), gitlab.com began [experimentally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/engineering/-/issues/64) requiring a \"Last Name\" field for new user registration\n   1. A [separate MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42346) recently began to \"split\" legacy names into a first and last name field. If I understand the design in that MR, it *can* cause an empty string for a last name\n1. [Kibana log](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7e98fff77a38dda1a9a7ed869137d7d2) of the customer hitting `SubscriptionsController#create` via `/-/subscriptions/new` on GitLab.com.  There is no associated Sentry errors for customer.gitlab.com that I can locate\n1. Prior to the support ticket being created, customer never had a customersDot account, so it's not possible that they would have attempted a purchase from customer portal. However, I'm unfamiliar with the behind-the-scenes code, so it's possible group billing page is calling out to customerDot to process the transaction. To the best of my knowledge, purchases from customersDot do require a `last_name` field.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPresumably using any GitLab.com user without a `last_name` (or a blank one), from any group not currently on a paid tier, navigate to Settings \u003e Billing page, click \"Upgrade\" under any of the 3 paid tiers. Note, \"Upgrade\" is displayed regardless if it's a new subscription or an actual upgrade from a lower tier.\n\nProceed normally by filling in details.\n\nPurchase fails.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNew purchase workflow from GitLab.com UI results in inability to purchase.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nA successful transaction\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Use customersDot.\n* *Possibly* edit GitLab.com user profile `name` field to be two \"words\", causing the name to split into a first and last name. This was not confirmed\n  * It is currently [not possible](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CDLCBGEDV/p1603382908188600?thread_ts=1603381169.185600\u0026cid=CDLCBGEDV) to edit one's profile and manually enter a Last Name, nor is it possible for an admin to enter one.\n\n### Related Issues / Epics\n\n1.

Both will be gathered on a routine basis (daily) and contain information on max historical user count and license key.  Given that there is this duplication, we should be able to retire Seat Link eventually in favor of License Sync.\n\nWe don't have all the specifics worked out yet but we feel confident that we can get quarterly co-terms working with license sync. Basically the idea would be to use the data from the license sync requests to feed the Reconciliation model, instead of using the seat link requests. It's a pretty simple concept from that standpoint, but there are still some details to be worked out such as:\n\n* Ensure the license sync data contains the data points that are required by Reconciliation (e.g. report date, license start date, license end date, max historical user count)\n* For seat link requests, the request received on day X contains data from day X-1. For license sync requests, I'm not sure it necessarily has to be that way, but there are good ways to keep with that same method. A day offset gives the rake task the opportunity to capture the user count information from HistoricalData after it has a chance to retry if necessary.\n* Figure out the handoff for which data input feeds the reconciliations (seat link vs license sync). Maybe both would be fine as it should be the same data, but that needs some thought.\n* Seat Link has been on for a while (introduced in an earlier version of GL) and by default SM instances opted in.  For License Sync, this has to be activated so we might not be gather as much data through this method, at least to begin with.  Determine if the business is okay with this. The handoff discussed int the above bullet point might inform this decision too.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis issue is dedicated to sorting out some of these details and adding it to the proposal document

Make sure to check if this issue has already been raised by someone else first to avoid duplication. \n\nFor each section below, please add screenshots or links or anything that may help visual learners understand the problem better, even if this takes you an extra minute or two this is a great help to some folks.\n\nhttps://www.learning-styles-online.com/style/visual-spatial/\n\n--\u003e\n\n### Problem\nAfter learning that our Web direct code is based entirely off the generated invoice of a Zuora transaction we need to convert the Zuora Invoice Id to its related Invoice Items and then to the correct Amendment, Rate Plan and Rate Plan Charges. The data sent differes for the different transaction types.\n\n### Proposal\n\nHere is how we will map invoice items to the data to be created:\n\n#### New Orders\n\n| Invoice Item    | Amendment to Create | Rate Plan To Create                                 | Rate Plan Charge To Create

|\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Positive Charge (New Product) | NewProduct           | Invoice Item's Related Rate Plan Charge's Rate Plan | Invoice Item's related Rate Plan Charge |\n| Negative Charge (Old Product) | RemoveProduct        | Invoice Item's Related Rate Plan Charge's Rate Plan | **No Charge, but the Zuora Id of the Rate Plan that is being removed must be entered into the Quote Rate Plan Charge's zqu__SubscriptionRatePlanZuoraId__c field**                                    |\n\n#### Renewal\n\n| Invoice Item                       | Amendement to Create | Rate Plan To Create                                 | Rate Plan Charge To Create              |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Positive Charge (Renewal)

Invoice Item's related Rate Plan Charge |\n\nFor all of the Rate Plan and Rate Plan Charge data we will create a 1:1 mapping of the Zuora Fields to the Zuora CPQ fields in Salesforce. @jpetr I will ask you to just make a simple table to map: \n\n#### Amendment\n\nSFDC: https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01I61000001QLnk?setupid=CustomObjects\n\nZuora:

However, as mentioned in the discussion below, it was difficult to add test coverage for this case because it required creating some test objects in Zuora (products, rate plan charges, etc) rather than mocking. This is because the [`amend_subscription_service_spec.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/755f660e602579136967dd818dc9049e782c2eaa/spec/services/amend_subscription_service_spec.rb) and [`renew_subscriptions_pajamas_spec.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a8eea433e2c8d5a2ae9cc8f4c94711ee22d62f7c/spec/features/renew_subscriptions_pajamas_spec.rb) use VCR.\n\n# Proposal\n\nEnsure proper test coverage for renewals in scenarios that should use list price and discounted price.\n\n## Follow-up from Discussion\n\nThe following discussion from !2057 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @tyleramos started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2057#note_429012271):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e **Question:** Should we add some additional tests to cover these new cases?

Make sure to check if this issue has already been raised by someone else first to avoid duplication. \n\nFor each section below, please add screenshots or links or anything that may help visual learners understand the problem better, even if this takes you an extra minute or two this is a great help to some folks.\n\nhttps://www.learning-styles-online.com/style/visual-spatial/\n\n--\u003e\n\n### Problem\n\nOrders within Subscription App are meant to be a 1:1 mapping to Zuora Subscriptions and be in sync.\n\nHowever some times the orders and the subscription that originated them diverge, whether because the subscription was cancelled/refunded and our app was lacking the logic to react to that scenario or because the callouts from Zuora never happened or all failed, Zuora is down, Subscription App is down... (so many possibilities)\n\nSo although we can create better mechanisms to account for each of this origins (and we are and should continue to do so), these are two independent systems and keep them in sync is not possible:100:% of the time.\n\nThat is why we want to put up for consideration to proactively fix these sync gaps when those are uncovered.\n\nBy:\n- Identifying a set of Zuora errors we get consistently.\n- Set up corrective reactions within the Subscription App.\n\n### :warning: Sync no more, soon...\n\nOur final goal is to make Zuora the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for CustomersDot and we want to keep that present and work towards that whenever possible. This translates into us writing any future code considering to actually rely on Zuora instead of reusing what is saved in `orders`. *Not only for this but all issues.*\n\n[Transition to Zuora as the SSoT Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4664) will group all the effort to accomplish this, it aims \"to reduce the data duplication in CustomerDot with Zuora and move us closer to calling Zuora the SSoT\". This is a big effort and in the meanwhile we want to still alleviate some of sales blockers if possible and that is what this issue is about.\n\n### What we want to solve\n\n**SITUATION:** Customer is purchasing a .com plan for a namespace that has a refunded subscription associated to this.\n\n**WHAT HAPPENS TODAY:** Customer is unable to proceed, contacts support, support deals manually with the order's state, support creates a ticket, the ticket is prioritized and ultimately an engineer will pick it up and try to find out the cause for this out of sync state (this cause is at this point not relevant, maybe the order is for a moment in time we didnt have logic to reset the order, maybe Zuora's profile was in silence mode, maybe callouts failed...) This is a lot of effort.\n\n**WHAT THIS ISSUE PROPOSES:**\nWhen Subscriptions App gets an error that **looks like the one for that **might** be related to this case, instead of raising right away and triggering all the response above, we can take a step to the side and:\n- Attempt to fix! In this case: Query Zuora for the state of the subscription associated to the order\n- **IF** it is cancelled\n  - Reset the order's subscription data via `ProcessInactiveSubscriptionService`\n  - Reattempt the user action (best case scenario customer purchased and it is happy)\n- **ELSE** fail like we do today\n\n\n### Result\n\nBy \"closely\" reacting to the identified (known) errors such as the one outlined and correcting the data we are saving a lot of time to support and removing many future duplicated issues that are created as a result.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-06T16:14:21.115Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T09:32:46.437Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T09:32:46.330Z","closed_by":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu

Currently, this Zuora process requires manual intervention. While there is a possibility of automating this in Zuora, we may find that the timing and LOE is so large that we will not see manual process relief for some time.\n\n### Manual effort estimation\n\nCurrently the billing team is spending an average of 110 hours monthly processing autorenewals (just those which actually renew, not those which must be cancelled due to non-payment) with a volume of over 560 subscriptions per month.\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's explore what the dev effort would be to automatically process the renewal via customers.gitlab.com similar to what we will do with [Quarterly Coterms](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/27470) so that customers.gitlab.com processes the renewal and charging of credit card.\n\n### Considerations\n\n1. Where the original subscription was sourced by Web Store, we should only process and offer the autorenew feature for subscriptions with a valid credit card on file.\n1. Where the original subscription was sourced by a sales-assisted order form, we should allow autorenew in any case. For those which have no credit card on file, we should generate the subscription and send an invoice.\n1.

The functionality is limited to updating the subscription and we do not check their current usage.\n\nFor this iteration, we should check the `Seats currently in use` count on gitlab.com. \n\nWith this check, we are trying to encourage the customer to pay for their current usage, instead of just adding the seats they think they need. The customer is not obliged or guided to settle their usage during their subscription period, so this check is an opportunity to settle their true usage of seats. \n\nBecause there is no automatic trueup charge on gitlab.com today (December 2020), we forfeit any seat usage money above their paid seats if the customer does not take any action to add and pay for seats. By checking for their current usage, there is a better chance that those seats will be accounted for.\n\n**Happy path:**\n1. Given the user has a subscription \n1. And the subscription is linked to the group namespace\n1. When the user selects the `Add more seats` button on their subscription card\n1. Then a check for the `Seats currently in use` count on gitlab.com will be triggered\n1. The user should be prompted to purchase a minimum number of seats to cover their current use\n\n#### Example\n\n1. Current subscription seat quantity = `10`\n1. Current seats in use = `15`\n1. When user selects `Add more seats`, the default the minimum `Add additional seats` quantity should be `5`\n1. The user should not be able to enter less than `5` additional seats and be able to checkout\n\n----\n\nConsiderations for the check failing:\n- the group and subscription are no longer linked because the group has been deleted\n- the group and subscription are no longer linked because the gitlab.com user no longer has Owner access to the group\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

a `type` column to the table and leverage that to determine the actual plan zuora is sending back - by changing the way we store this data for retrieval, we could simplify things here a bit.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e For instance:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e Adding a table with `product_rate_plan_id` as `id` and `type` and `year`(1, 2, 3 or 5 if needed).  We could then have STI models where we have `StarterRatePlan`, `UltimateRatePlan`, etc... with a `RatePlan` model that base off of this one - we could also create multiple tables if wanted instead of STI and have a similar concept.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e \n    \u003e We then would be able simplify the case statement you have below - probably change the concept a bit more here by leveraging something like `RatePlan.find_by(id: product_rate_plan_id).type`, where type would be `starter`, `premium`, etc\n    \u003e \n    \u003e food for thought as an alternative here...could likely also achieve similar code simplification perhaps be a slight restructure of the plans in the `application.yml` and then leverage includes and other enumerable tools.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-04T13:24:09.199Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T14:22:05.878Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T14:22:05.801Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"labels":["backend","devops::fulfillment","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3841241,"username":"dstull","name":"Doug Stull","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d7b8532bca28f593b193b012841a40?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dstull"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1921","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1921","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1921/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1921/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1921","relative":"#1921","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1921"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70694537,"iid":1920,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Follow-up from \"Add UI for adding seats to a dotcom subscription\"","description":"The following discussion from !1830 should be addressed:\n\nIn a review comment for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1830#note_406673174 it was brought up that the partial names that are rendered in the `subscriptions#edit` action can be misleading.

Why do we reset the subscription start/end date when we downgrade someone to free?","description":"# Overview\nAs part of the .com downgrade effort, we have a banner that is intended to display if the customer is past their subscription end date AND on a free plan. \n\nDuring testing we realized that the downgrade code initiated through Zuora as well as the Customers Portal reset the subscription start date to the date of the downgrade and clears out the end date. \n\n\nWe would like to understand why this is the case and if there would be any unforeseen consequences if we were to change it. \n\nPlease discuss. \n\nCC @amandarueda @chris_baus @jameslopez @pcalder @jejacks0n
