Inform the customer that they have more users than purchased seats.\n2. Propose the following options:\n   1. Contact their purchase partner to purchase more seats.\n   2. Deal with overages at the end of the subscription term (via True-Ups).\n   3. Remove excess users.\n3. Depending on what option was selected, wait for the daily sync job to run and re-calculate the Billable users count.\n4. Link the subscription and confirm there are no overages recorded.\n\n## Proposal\n\nUpdate the `Change Linked Namespace` flow for a subscription that is purchased via a reseller.\n\n- **If they have more users in their group than purchased seats**, display a message about the overage and let the user know that they will be charged for the overage at the end of their subscription term. Allow them to associate the subscription to the namespace regardless of overages.\n- **If there is no overage** for a reseller customer, we will use the current flow (no changes needed).\n\n| Current

meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YbxNCo3KXK1-KdIZTgSvmU9kIslYjQnFZAmmu1DSqQ/edit#heading=h.lif00r71v2kb), it was suggested that the `Account` model name could be improved by renaming to `BillingAccount`.  This should avoid confusion in thinking an `Account` in CustomersDot is the same as a GitLab `Organization`.\n\nWe also want to standardize naming across our Order to Cash systems in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9018.  Given this, we've identified the column name `BillingAccount.name` should be `BillingAccount.zuora_account_name` to avoid confusion.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRename the `Account` model to `BillingAccount` avoid confusion.  Given we are renaming `Account`, let's also rename `AccountMembership` as well.\n\n- Rename model `Account` to `BillingAccount`\n   - Rename DB table `accounts` to `billing_accounts`\n- Rename model `AccountMembership` to `BillingAccountMembership`\n   - Rename DB table `account_memberships` to `billing_account_memberships`\n\nAlso rename the column `BillingAccount.name` to `BillingAccount.zuora_account_name`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-14T18:15:25.767Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T21:16:54.576Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T15:13:47.884Z","closed_by":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Fulfillment Platform","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","section::fulfillment","workflow::in review"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4985","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4985","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4985/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4985/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4985","relative":"#4985","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4985"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8950,"epic":{"id":621714,"iid":8950,"title":"Iteration 1A: Align CustomersDot BillingAccounts and Users to Zuora objects","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":116852923,"iid":4980,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Investigate: `invoice.DMRC` mismatch during Renewal+Upgrade","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

As discussed in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331+, this is a problem for a few reasons, leading to a variety of bugs. The ~\"group::fulfillment platform\" team is working to correct this by introducing new data models to allow for Accounts and Account Memberships (and renaming Customers to Users to reduce confusion). Multiple Users in CDot should be able to be associated with a BillingAccount. On the flip side, one User record should be able to be associated with multiple BillingAccount (through BillingAccountMemberships).\n\nThe UI for CustomersDot currently only supports one User per BillingAccount and one BillingAccount per User. As we work on updating the data structure, we need to think about IA and navigational changes to allow an Account to have multiple billing managers and a User to have multiple BillingAccountMemberships.\n\n## Proposal\n\nExplore how the new data structure will impact the IA and navigation of CDot.\n\n- How/where do Users manage their personal user data vs data associated with an BillingAccount(s)?\n- How/where do Users associate additional Customers with an BillingAccount?\n- If a User has multiple BillingAccount memberships, how does the choose which BillingAccount they are managing before the normal operations and features are shown, like Managing Purchases or Editing Account information?\n\nWhile the output of this issue will be the final design/specs of the navigation for a customer with a single BillingAccount only, this issue will also explore, design, and validate navigation for customers with _multiple_ BillingAccounts (because we want to make sure that the navigation will scale to that use case).\n\n### Information architecture\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nI wanted to understand how the new User/BillingAccount data architecture and IA will impact CDot navigation. \n\n:art: [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/6eubaRn3G9YP5PmVsHijlr/Navigation-for-CDot-to-represent-new-Customer%2FAccount-data-structure?node-id=0%3A1) for the explorations\n\n#### Process\n\nTo start, I did a site map of the current state of CDot. I wanted to understand which information that currently lives under the User model will be moving to the BillingAccount model. Based on information in this [thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4799#note_1100958075) and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4799 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4793, I highlighted all affected information/pages in blue. \n\n![image](/uploads/bf7ceeed3af0db542495d2969e15821c/image.png)\n\nFrom there, I started reorganizing and grouping the information, making a clearer distinction between what information lives on the User model and what information lives on the BillingAccount model. The team has already ironed out these details as part of spike/exploration work in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331, so this is really just a visualization of that work and thinking through how a user might access it and interact with it.\n\n![image](/uploads/061023388554b5acf03dd127f70ce8da/image.png)\n\nBecause it's important to think about the navigation and IA holistically, the site map is based on the end state of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331+. However, I also wanted to think about how this work breaks down and how it fits into the iterations that we've outlined in that Epic. \n\nI mapped out which parts of the experience would be tackled as part of each iteration (and other key Fulfillment projects like https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8905+).\n\n![image](/uploads/ea4cd5f8b93442fa5ee5c5ed3d824d8a/image.png)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Wireframes\n\n**:clapper: Check out the [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/pbT0Wn4kWJQ)! (5 1/2 minutes)**\n\nTopics addressed in the video:\n\n* How does the introduction of the BillingAccount impact the *current* information architecture of CDot?\n* How will the information architecture change to support the BillingAccount structure?\n* What navigation options have been explored to represent that BillingAccount relationship to the user?\n* What are the next steps and how can I give feedback?\n\nSee [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4973#note_1285983310) for more details about the wireframes and how to give feedback.\n\n### Visual designs\n\nBased on the feedback on the wireframes, I explored a variety of different visual designs for the navigation. There were two different designs that moved forward into solution validation.\n\n| Option 1: Dropdown switcher in the left sidebar | Option 2: Account info page header with button to switch Accounts  |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| ![image](/uploads/58178fbb675257b75fd0542ad5378707/image.png)  | ![image](/uploads/db830f150dd55f4350d26b7e9e0bf12a/image.png) |\n\n### Prototypes\n\nEach of the two visual design options were built out into full prototypes for user testing.\n\n**Important note:** The content and design of many of the pages (such as the My accounts page, the Account details page, and the Billing managers page) is **not final or finished**. There are separate UX issues open to fully design and test these pages. But in order to test the navigation, there needed to be _something_ on those pages, so I threw together quick mockups for the purposes of the user test. \n\n**Prototype links**\n  * [Navigation Option 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/iCqd9J7DOCTS7Q3CDcKdPX/Subscription-management?page-id=33%3A17506\u0026node-id=87%3A27374\u0026viewport=-22%2C1031%2C0.13\u0026scaling=scale-down\u0026starting-point-node-id=87%3A27374\u0026disable-default-keyboard-nav=1\u0026hotspot-hints=0\u0026hide-ui=1)\n  * [Navigation Option 2](https://www.figma.com/proto/iCqd9J7DOCTS7Q3CDcKdPX/Subscription-management?page-id=33%3A17506\u0026node-id=125%3A36077\u0026viewport=-20%2C2321%2C0.13\u0026scaling=scale-down\u0026starting-point-node-id=125%3A36077\u0026disable-default-keyboard-nav=1\u0026hotspot-hints=0\u0026hide-ui=1)\n\n### Solution validation \n\n**:clapper: Want a quick(ish) overview?** I put together an [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq4Ywc58ISk) (7 mins) walking through the goals of the research, the prototypes we tested, and the results.\n\n**:book: Want to dig into the findings?** If you're interested in the more detailed insights, check out the solution validation [issue description](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2149#what-did-we-learn).

That seems like the desired behavior. We would have no need to send the `bill_to_id` at that point too, so it would be some simplification of the code and the params in the configured callouts.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n* Reference to code that triggers the welcome email: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a370c2b4b1a4fec50a6be2291c7b0ec7c73e0cd7/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L79\n* Reference to code where `billable` is set: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a370c2b4b1a4fec50a6be2291c7b0ec7c73e0cd7/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L62\n\n### Result\n\nAll customers that purchase directly from GitLab (not Reseller) will receive a [Welcome email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/92e7ac101afa342c73a8896285e83ef6/welcome-to-portal-email.png).\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-12T18:41:58.156Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T19:52:33.189Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T18:18:54.174Z","closed_by":{"id":8110789,"username":"tgolubeva","name":"Tatyana Golubeva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8110789/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tgolubeva"},"labels":["Category:Billing \u0026 Payments","Deliverable","Track Health Status [DEPRECATED]","backend","bug::functional","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::billing and subscription management","priority::1","section::fulfillment","severity::1","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[{"id":11649502,"username":"aluthra2","name":"Aman Luthra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11649502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aluthra2"}],"author":{"id":8110789,"username":"tgolubeva","name":"Tatyana Golubeva","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8110789/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tgolubeva"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11649502,"username":"aluthra2","name":"Aman Luthra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11649502/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aluthra2"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4957","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4957","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4957/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4957/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4957","relative":"#4957","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4957"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":86630,"iid":151,"sequence":2,"group_id":9970,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-10-04T21:31:23.242Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T00:05:02.385Z","start_date":"2022-11-03","due_date":"2022-11-17","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/iterations/86630"},"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":116773583,"iid":4956,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Create proposal doc with ERD","description":"### Background\n\nWe would like to create a proposal document that lives in the customers-gitlab-com project.

What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWhen enabled, this feature will prevent the `SendSeatOverageNotificationJob` from being enqueued for specific GitLab namespace ids (currently just `10782951`).  See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5582 for more info.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nThe feature flag should make it easier to toggle this blocking logic.  If it doesn't work, it's possible that the `SendSeatOverageNotificationJob` doesn't get blocked properly for the specified namespace.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nWe can monitor problems [in Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/) or [in Sidekiq](https://customers.gitlab.com/sidekiq/).\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.\n- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.\n- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4934) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable\n\n### Global rollout on CustomersDot production\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)\n- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.\n- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment\n- [~] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4934) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Ensure https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358080 has been resolved before removing the feature flagged code.\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `block_seat_overage_notification` feature flag\n  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production\n- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected\n- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:\n  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/165/edit)","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-11T13:08:07.848Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T12:34:09.730Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T12:34:09.691Z","closed_by":{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana Zubova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9299375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzubova"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Billing and Subscription Management","devops::fulfillment","feature flag","frontend","group::billing and subscription management","maintenance::removal","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2745650,"iid":84,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.9","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:02.303Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:02.303Z","due_date":"2023-02-17","start_date":"2023-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/84"},"assignees":[{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana Zubova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9299375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzubova"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana Zubova","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9299375/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/dzubova"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4948","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":25,"completed_count":23},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4948","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4948/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4948/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4948","relative":"#4948","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4948"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":116614517,"iid":4946,"project_id":2670515,"title":"[Reseller] Hide subscription management buttons for a subscription purchased via a reseller","description":"## Problem\n\nSubscriptions purchased via a Reseller should not be amended via the Customers Portal. \n\nAny subscription changes should be done via the Reseller (and not the customer), since Resellers are responsible for paying the related invoices.\n\nFor screenshots of the current experience for Reseller customer (if they were able to login) see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/809+.\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nHide the following buttons on the subscription card if the subscription is managed by a reseller:\n\n- Add Seats\n- Upgrade\n- Resume\n- Cancel\n- Renew\n- Buy additional CI Minutes\n- Buy additional Storage\n\nLooks like we have a `subscription.managed_by_reseller?` method in the code.\n\n### SM Subscription card\n\nAll buttons should be removed. \n\n![cdot-sm-subscription-card-crossed](/uploads/268a4f53a15dd0972e6512e9a0559ac0/cdot-sm-subscription-card-crossed.png)\n\n### SaaS Subscription card\n\nThe only button we need to keep is `Change linked namespace`\n\n![cdot-saas-subscription-card-crossed](/uploads/0eba0eec5a61f0a15a8f87d25d623860/cdot-saas-subscription-card-crossed.png)\n\n**Note:** Hiding the `Buy new subscription` button will be tackled in this issue -

Create activation codes for subscriptions on legacy licenses pre-SCL","description":"## Background\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/589+ defines the process for customers to activate with Cloud Licensing mid-term if they already have an active legacy license subscription. For most customers, a Support ticket is required to move to Cloud Licensing.\n\nTo make it easier for these customers to self-activate with Cloud Licensing, this issue will evaluate the possibility of mass-generating activation codes for customers that do not have one.\n\n## Details\nToday, the Customer Portal subscription activation display banner for `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `null` has a dependency on if an activation code exists.\n* If activation code exists: display legacy download option only\n* If activation code does not exist: display activation code only\n\nAs of September 2022, we are creating activation codes for all subscriptions where `TurnOnCloudLicensing` is not = `No`. However, prior to SCL launch (July 2022), we did not create activation codes for these subscriptions.\n\n## Proposal\n1. Query the subscription names with `TurnOnCloudLicensing` set to `null` and `Status = \"Active\"` in Zuora (with a Data Query, [example](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/platform/data-query/queries/20e2a75f-8e30-4ea6-b922-a0a73c80efde)) and then cross check those with existing cloud activations. \n2. If no cloud activation exists for the subscription name, create one.\n3. In doing so, ensure we do NOT send customers emails with the activation code (to avoid confusion).\n\n## Result\nAll customers (who did not explicitly opt out of Cloud Licensing, `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `No`) will have a cloud license activation code available for download visible in the Customer Portal, allowing for mid-term activations of cloud licensing without the need for a support ticket.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-29T16:29:57.567Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T17:03:19.757Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T14:56:21.030Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"labels":["Category:SM Provisioning","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","maintenance::refactor","missed:15.5","missed:15.6","priority::4","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"}],"author":{"id":7964536,"username":"courtmeddaugh","name":"Courtney Meddaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7964536/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/courtmeddaugh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4892","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4892","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4892/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4892/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4892","relative":"#4892","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4892"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8864,"epic":{"id":612983,"iid":8864,"title":"[Iteration 2] Increase Opportunities for Mid-term Activation of Cloud Licensing for Pre-SCL Customers","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8864","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":115954457,"iid":4887,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Perform Post Order creation steps for amendment","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

Since we don't have log.gitlab.net for CDot this will take some manual effort.\n\nEngineering-wise, we can look into reducing seat link time. \n\nThe peak probably means a large number of self-managed instances are concentrated in the same timezone. We may also look into spreading the sync time further apart. \n\nProduct management-wise: we may have to consider increase the request threshold (urgency). According to [Rails request Apdex SLI doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#decreasing-the-urgency-setting-a-higher-target-duration), automated process is not user face therefore it makes sense to have a lower urgency.\n\n### Result\n\nReduce the number of apdex errors.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?\n\nA healthier [apdex percentage](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/customersdot-main/customersdot-overview?orgId=1\u0026viewPanel=23\u0026from=now-7d\u0026to=now) of less than -5%.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-28T04:27:03.423Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T20:38:34.930Z","closed_at":"2023-01-18T07:58:33.644Z","closed_by":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"labels":["Error Budget Improvement","[deprecated] Category:Provision","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","maintenance::workflow","missed:15.6","missed:15.7","priority::2","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":2745648,"iid":83,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:57:34.875Z","due_date":"2023-01-17","start_date":"2022-12-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/83"},"assignees":[{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"}],"author":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"user_notes_count":37,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4884","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4884","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4884/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4884/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4884","relative":"#4884","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4884"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9397,"epic":{"id":671622,"iid":9397,"title":"Provision Error Budget Improvements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9397","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e month remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"at_risk"},{"id":115885543,"iid":4881,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Update the admin_access feature spec","description":"### Summary\n\n`spec/features/rails_admin/admin_access_spec.rb` Covers the actions an Admin has access to per model via the Admin app.\n\nThis test is out of date.

Is this something you have seen reported in the last month or since the release of cloud activation?\n\nHowever, in some cases when the following conditions are also true:\n\n1. A future-dated renewal amendment exists\n2. The current, pre-renewal version of the subscription has true-ups\n\nThe cloud license being generated is failing to activate until at least the start date of the renewal term when the license gets generated with the most recent version of the subscription.\n\nIt seems to be related to true-up checking (documented in at least 2 of the reported examples), and possibly current billable users since the trueup logic includes a [fallback check on current users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/066245b248aa8df95958302656b252705d0f74fc/ee/app/models/license.rb#L507-508) that would normally be skipped in cloud licenses.\n\nCurrently unknown why the true-up logic would be failing, even for the current (non-renewal) term; in theory it should be generating a license that works the same as it did at the start of the current term.  It's using `trueup_from` and `trueup_to` of the current period, in other words, `trueup_from == current_starts_at - 1 year` and `trueup_to == current_starts_at`\n\n[example ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/329201)  \n[example customer](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/205112/edit)  \n[example cloud license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1043282)\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Be on legacy license\n2. Have your current term subscription include true-ups\n3. Adjust user counts in a way that prevents your current license from being reactivated\n   - Either increase your billable users count, or your max historical (for current term)\n4. Try to convert to cloud license prior to renewal\n\n## Proposed fix\n\nIt's really the trueup logic at fault here, since that both re-validates current term trueups and also contains a current users check (which would be skipped without `License#check_trueup` being called).  Because these numbers can change over the course of a year, re-activating the current term license may be impossible.\n\nSidenote: Perhaps this highlights the [discussions in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/511).\n\n1. Skip all of `License#check_users_limit`, `License#check_trueup`, and `License#check_restricted_user_count` when renewing or prior to renewing from legacy to cloud license the first time.\n \n## Workarounds\n\n1. Wait until start date of the renewal period\n\n## Reported examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/329201\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/325200\n1.

True-ups?\n\nTrue-ups are the outstanding overage of maximum users exceeding the users/seats in a license of a self-managed subscription. Any overages during the subscription term need to be resolved by purchasing additional seats for the subscription. True-ups are handled as an add-on product to the subscription during renewal. They are validated when the new license is applied to a self-managed instance.\n\n### How to find the overage\n\nThere are two places within a self-managed instance where the overage is displayed:\n1. Visit the admin dashboard (`/admin`) and look for the `License overview` section. A box displays the overage number as `USERS OVER LICENSE`.\n   \u003cdetails\u003e\n   ![admin_dashboard](/uploads/2a4e2bffda091bdafcff3611f1423935/admin_dashboard.png)\n   \u003c/details\u003e\n2. Visit the subscription page (`/admin/subscription`) to find a similar box as on the admin dashboard that displays the overage number as `USERS OVER SUBSCRIPTION`.\n   \u003cdetails\u003e\n   ![subscription](/uploads/e5f7c8f6201814dd0112d90a6ef6f34d/subscription.png)\n   \u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n## Quarterly reconciliations\n\nQuarterly reconciliations is a feature that is offered within Cloud Licenses. If enabled, a self-managed instance will send seat link information to CustomersDot on a daily basis. This information includes a count of active users and a historical maximum user count.\n\nThe manual true-up process is replaced by an automated quarterly reconciliation process which uses the information from the daily seat link sync to amend subscriptions with any additional users added within the past quarter.\n\n### Difference to quarterly reconciliations (QSR)\n\nTrue-ups are an annual process which means that users over the license needs to be paid for the whole subscription term. When the users were added is not important for this.\n\nQuarterly reconciliations are performed quarterly. Any users over the license needs to be paid for for the remaining subscription term only. This process can result in substantial savings.\n\nSee [this documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.html) for an example on the difference in costs.\n\n## CustomersDot\n\n### Subscription renewal\n\nWhen renewing a self-managed subscription, a section for true-ups will be displayed. The customer is required to enter their current users over the license. Otherwise the license created for the renewal might not work on their instance (might will be explained in the GitLab section).\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n![renewal](/uploads/966d6de03d0ed59abbf4b6a3a2663599/renewal.png)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nTrue-ups are handled as an add-on product to the subscription. [This code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0bd9c8aa410b0e3c924d17a9240db2644ff2e1b/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L162-186) applies the true-up product if required.\n\nWhen the license is created for the renewal, [the code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0bd9c8aa410b0e3c924d17a9240db2644ff2e1b/app/models/license.rb#L82) checks if true-up info needs to be set. This is only the case if the true-up quantity is greater than 0 and the license has a term end date. If it is the case, the true-up date range [is automatically set](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0bd9c8aa410b0e3c924d17a9240db2644ff2e1b/app/models/license.rb#L160-165) to the year prior to the current subscription term.\n\n### Manual license creation\n\nWhen creating a license manually in the Admin, the true-up count can be filled in during the creation as an optional field. Similar to the renewal process, the overage number has to be sufficient to cover the current overage of an instance.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n![license_creation](/uploads/811e3e93dc56cb71dcb2769c9290ae3f/license_creation.png)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n## GitLab\n\nWhen applying a license to a self-managed instance, [a validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ba33e30e7295c3528e0eda559dc6768c3c90a257/ee/app/models/license.rb#L36) checks for a sufficient true-up count. This check is only executed if the true-up info is set and the flag `reconciliation_completed` (license restriction attribute) is not set to `true` in the license. If the latter is set to `true`, true-ups will be skipped due to a successful Q3 quarterly reconciliation.\n\nThe historical max during the given true-up date range is used for this validation ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/ba33e30e7295c3528e0eda559dc6768c3c90a257/ee/app/models/license.rb#L502)). If a previous user count (license restriction attribute `previous_user_count`) is present in the license, the historical max subtracted by the previous user count equals the expected true-up count. If the previous user count is missing, the daily billable users count is used instead (there's a reported bug for this fallback in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361345).\n\nThe expected true-up count is then compared to the true-up count set in the license plus an additional 10% overage threshold (hence the \"might not work\" phrasing in the CustomersDot section). The threshold part is only available in versions \"%14.2\"+. If it's greater or equal the restricted user count (license restriction attribute `active_user_count`) is validated. This validation adds an error to the user count if the restricted user count plus a 10% overage threshold is less than the restricted user count in the license. If the expected true-up count is less than the true-up count set in the license plus an additional 10% overage threshold, the true-up validation results in an error that is added to the base errors (errors that are not associated to a specific attribute).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/aaa552b248b3af6dd2a4de88173fff7bfe85f4e1/doc/subscriptions/self_managed/index.md#users-over-license\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/30adf0ce90db1326e9e53388aae26b3266651033/doc/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.md#quarterly-reconciliation-and-annual-true-ups\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/510+\n- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/quote-to-cash/troubleshooting/#true-ups-adding-seats-users\n\n## Possible improvements\n\n1. No documentation about true-ups in CustomersDot. Is documentation in GitLab already sufficient?\n1. Consolidate different spellings of true-up. GitLab, CustomersDot and the handbook use a mix of `true-up`, `trueup` and `true up`. It looks like `true-up` is the spelling that is used for customer-facing content.\n   * **Here's one merge request that refactors the spelling in CustomersDot docs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6225+**\n1. A previous investigation suggested to loosen the true-up validation for Cloud Licenses or even skip it entirely. This is still under discussion though, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362076+.\n\n\n## Knowledge sharing

These CDot services that integrate with Salesforce use `Customer` (later to be renamed `User`) information stored in the CDot database like company name, first and last name, email, country, state, zip to create the Salesforce objects.\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331, Fulfillment is looking at improving the data architecture of CDot, in particular the `Customer`/`BillingAccount` alignment.  We are focusing on simplifying the `Customer` model, and treating this more like a \"User of the Customer Portal\" (later to be renamed `User`), persisting mainly email address, first name and last name.  These `Customer`s (later renamed `User`s) would have memberships to `BillingAccount`s, which represent Zuora Accounts.  Much of the data that is pulled from `Customer` currently, could be pulled directly from Zuora (and potentially cached in CDot in later iterations) via the Zuora Account and the Sold To Contact for the `BillingAccount`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nInvestigate whether CustomersDot can use the Sold To Contact from the Subscription's Zuora Account, instead of `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) data stored in

Make sure to check if this issue has already been raised by someone else first to avoid duplication. \n\nFor each section below, please add screenshots or links or anything that may help visual learners understand the problem better, even if this takes you an extra minute or two this is a great help to some folks.\n\nhttps://www.learning-styles-online.com/style/visual-spatial/\n\n--\u003e\n\n## Background\nToday, not all cloud licensing subscriptions are generated for the full subscription term.\n\nThe logic defined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b555261242ad22c16a988161f2615b8aa07cb78f/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L7-20) defines license end date upon creation of a license. The way this logic is written, if a customer purchases a multi-year subscription and is:\n\n1. On Cloud Licensing AND (QSR OR Ramp): license is issued for the full term purchased for :white_check_mark:\n1. On Cloud Licensing AND **(NOT on QSR and Not on Ramp)**: license is issued for one year only :exclamation:\n\n\nThe thinking for this was that it provides sales with the opportunity for checking for true-ups prior to the start of a new year.\n\n## Problem\nWith this logic, all Cloud Licensing Multi-Year Subscriptions where the customer is not on QSR will expire after 1 year. This will result in the customer losing access entirely at the start of the second year, unless: \n* Sales creates a new $0 quote for the second year, it is synced to Zuora/CDot, and then the customer receives a new activation code? :thinking: this is the only way to avoid this I can think of.\n* This is definitely not a process sales is familiar with.\n\nRelated to this, because of the logic of `term start date` + `1 year`, we are actually creating expired activation codes on year 2. Separate issue for this specifically created here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4815\n\n### What is the Impact?\nWe expect the majority of customers who are on Cloud Licensing to also have QSR enabled, however, the following categories of customers are currently opted out of QSR by default, but not out of Cloud Licensing:\n1. Channel customers\n2. PubSec customers\n3. PO Required customers\n4. MSA customers\n5. Legacy Ramp customers\n6. Customers on non-standard terms\n\n\nA quick report of new/renewal quotes sent to Zuora with a `Close Date` in 2022, `Initial Term` \u003e `12`, `TurnOnCloudLicensing__c` = `Yes` and `TurnOnSeatReconciliation__c` = `No`:\n* 40 quotes\n\nLooking at this same criteria but New quotes (not yet sent to Zuora), we see:\n* 92 quotes\n\nHowever, with SCL launch having only happened 2 months ago, we can expect this number to continue to increase at a higher rate as all customers are set to `TurnOnCloudLicensing__c` = `Yes` by default.\n\n### Reported Examples\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/331005\n2. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/336134\n3. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/340677\n4. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/343223\n5. A [Mid-Market Customer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001kHwnHQAS) has encountered this after the first year of their 3-Year contract resulted in an \"expired\" cloud activation. [Ticket for reference](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/351591).\n\n## Proposal\n\n**Summary:** Update license creation logic to generate all cloud licenses for the full term\n\nWe can remove the dependency on QSR for generating a full term license.

In this issue, the following should be covered:\n\n- [x] Add `billing_account_id` column: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5732\n- [x] Start setting `billing_account_id` in application logic (e.g. when creating a `License`) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5747\n- [x] Use new `billing_account` relationship instead of `customer` when `account_data_structure` [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867) is enabled https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5798\n- [x] Introduce rake task to backfill `billing_account_id` for existing `License` records https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5967\n   - ~~If it's easier, this could be added to the rake task from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4798.  Or it could be a standalone task.~~\n\n### Result\n\n`billing_account_id` will be populated similar to how `customer_id` is set currently.  `customer_id` will continue to be populated to ensure compatibility and allow us to revert if needed.  When the feature flag is enabled, the new `billing_account_id` will be used instead of `customer_id`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-13T15:03:37.936Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T10:34:03.295Z","closed_at":"2022-12-01T13:40:56.882Z","closed_by":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Fulfillment Platform","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","missed:15.6","quad-planning::complete-no-action","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4192493,"username":"ebaque","name":"Etienne Baqué","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4192493/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ebaque"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4802","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":4,"completed_count":4},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4802","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4802/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4802/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4802","relative":"#4802","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4802"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8950,"epic":{"id":621714,"iid":8950,"title":"Iteration 1A: Align CustomersDot BillingAccounts and Users to Zuora objects","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":114965413,"iid":4800,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Add billing_account_id to CloudActivation","description":"### Problem\n\nThe `CloudActivation` model currently has an association with an individual `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) via foreign key `customer_id`.

However, there are still places where the `BillingAccount` and/or `BillingAccountMembership` should be created outside of this workflow.\n\n- Sales-assisted purchases\n- Renewals\n\nIn these cases, CustomersDot processes the callout from Zuora in order to update the `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) and provision the subscription.  The Zuora callout code in CustomersDot needs to be updated to handle `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` creation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIn this issue, the `FindOrCreateCustomerService` should be updated to create an `BillingAccountMembership` for a `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) when the `zuora_account_id` attribute is present.  It should also consider creating the `BillingAccount` if it doesn't already exist.\n\nIf an existing `Customer` is found, but the `Customer` is not associated with the `BillingAccount` matching `zuora_account_id`, a new `BillingAccountMembership` (and potentially new `BillingAccount`) could be created.  \n\nWe've decided for this first iteration (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950), that we want to ensure only one `BillingAccountMembership` for a Customer.  This is to keep the same behavior as before, allowing us to step into the new data architecture and roll out the changes more effectively.  See the description in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950#purpose for more info.\n\n#### Feature flag\n\nThis logic will be feature flagged in the short term using [the `:account_data_persistence` flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/171/edit). Here is the rollout issue for it: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5060+. Once we confirm the data is being created as expected and doesn't have any negative effects with the existing creation behavior, we will remove this feature flag.\n\nAs this is just creating data in the new models but not using it yet, we shouldn't need to use the `:account_data_structure` [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/160/edit) for this logic. Eventually, the code setting `customer.zuora_account_id` will be removed but for now both will be set.

'TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS' functionality in the following ways:\n\n(1) Add method `#check_terms_and_conditions` to `Orders::Amendment::ActionTypesGenerator` (see `#check_renewal` for implementation structure). The method returns based on the `params` whether a product is being added to subscription. Use existing logic from `AmendSubscriptionService`.\n\n(2) Add method `#terms_and_conditions` to `Zuora::Orders::FeatureAvailability`. This checks if `Unleash.enabled?(:use_orders_api_terms_and_conditions_workflow)` is enabled. Add `terms_and_conditions` to `SUPPORTED_TYPES` constant\n\n(3) Create validator `Zuora::Orders::Amendment::Validators::TermsAndConditions`. Implement `#validate` method that validates if the request for updating terms and conditions is valid. (see `Renewal validator` for implementation structure).

As a result, this was removed as part of this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4688\n\n## Problem\nSince this update, we have identified that the activation code logic still includes the check that a purchase was completed through a self-service path. With the SS logic removed, this is now preventing activation code creation for _all_ sales assisted Self-Managed purchases.\n\n_Note: self-service purchases are still working as expected_\n\n####

Proposal\n\nRemove the `self_service?` check altogether from the activation code logic.\n\n\n### Result\nCloud activation codes will be created for all Self-Managed subscriptions who do not have

So the below description uses `Arrow` to describe the scenario. However, this scenario applies to all Marketplace orders. It does not limit to Arrow.\n\nPreviously Arrow system talks to Gitlab Platypus API endpoint(and then Platypus talks to CustomersDot). We will remove Platypus in this communication chain.\n\n* previously(as of today): `Arrow -\u003e Platypus -\u003e CustomersDot`\n* after removing Platypus, Arrow will directly talk to CustomersDot: `Arrow -\u003e CustomersDot`\n\nIn order to achieve this, there are several changes required on CustomersDot side.\n\n1. implement OAuth provider in CustomersDot. This allows secure API access control. We propose to use `doorkeeper` gem.\n1. add required data mapping in CustomersDot. This maps some Arrow payload data to the CustomersDot/Zuora/SFDC required values.\n1. track the Arrow order status. The status is used to:  allow Arrow to poll the order status; validate duplicate requests; ensure to take action safely only on the right order status.\n1. provide API endpoint for Arrow to poll the order status.\n\nFor more information, refer to the task breakdown at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4637#note_1062429151.\n\n### This issue's scope\n\nThis issue covers the thrid task `track the Arrow order status`\n\n#### Proposal\n\nCreate a table `MarketplaceOrders`(columns: `external_subscription_source, external_subscription_id, payload, status(:creating, :failed, :created, :provisioned)`. This has the benefit to prevent duplicated API requests from Arrow.\n\n* An Arrow create order request comes\n* If there is a validation error, return failure without tracking this order.\n* Check the existence of `external_subscription_id`/`external_subscription_source`. \n   * If does not exists, create new `marketplace_orders` record for this `external_subscription_id`/`external_subscription_source`, and mark the status as `:creating`. Continue\n   * If exists and the status is `:failed`, reset the order(status to `:creating`, payload to new payload). Continue.\n   * If exists and the status is not `:failed`, return duplicated order error.\n* Start to create the customer/subscription/order/sfdc..\n* If the CDot failed to create the subscription, mark the status as `failed`\n* When customer/subscription/order are created, mark status as `:created`\n* After notify_customer(this is currently in ZuoracallbackWorker), mark the status as `:provisioned`.\n\n#### Where does the `check duplicate marketplace order` sit in the process flow.\n**NOTE**: this is a simplified flowchart. It does not contain some steps like `map payload`, `check Visual compliance`, `check customer existance`. We could also consider all of these as part of the general `create subscription` node.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A(Start) --\u003e|POST order request received| B[Authentication]\n    B --\u003e C{Authenticated?}\n    C --\u003e|No| D(Reject request)\n    C --\u003e|Yes| E[Validate payload]\n    E --\u003e F{valid payload?}\n    F --\u003e|No| D\n    F --\u003e|Yes| G[check existing order record]\n    G --\u003e H{order exists?}\n    H --\u003e|No| L[Create order record]\n    L --\u003e I[Create subscription]\n    H --\u003e|Yes|J{existing order failed?}\n    J --\u003e|No| D\n    J --\u003e|Yes| K[Reset order status]\n    K --\u003e I\n    \n```\n\n#### State transition diagram\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --\u003e creating\n    creating --\u003e created: Customer/Order/ZuoraSubscription created\n    creating --\u003e failed: Encounter error\n    failed --\u003e creating: Receive the order request again\n    created --\u003e provisioned: Customer notification sent\n    provisioned --\u003e [*]\n            \n```\n### Problem\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~\"Enterprise Applications\" team if Zuora business logic is involved. --\u003e\n\n### Result\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-30T06:25:46.935Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T16:02:19.010Z","closed_at":"2022-10-07T12:15:15.827Z","closed_by":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"labels":["Category:Fulfillment Integrations \u0026 Visibility","devops::fulfillment","feature::addition","group::provision","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453027,"iid":77,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.5","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:29:56.909Z","due_date":"2022-10-17","start_date":"2022-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/77"},"assignees":[{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"}],"author":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4732","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4732","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4732/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/4732/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#4732","relative":"#4732","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#4732"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8666,"epic":{"id":594198,"iid":8666,"title":"Remove Platypus from the E-Disty marketplace architecture","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8666","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 18, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
