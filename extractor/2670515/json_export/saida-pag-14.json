This phase is run during `pre-compile assets` when building an image for Auto DevOps.  Unfortunately, when the image is being built there is no environment. The image hasn't been deployed to production, staging, or a review app yet.  This causes the build to fail.\n\nThe specific piece of code causing the failure is this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/config/application.rb#L65\n```ruby\n# Load all the plans from Zuora and initialize Plan model in an instance variable.\n# Avoid load in test environment as the call from Zuora is been preloaded via VCR cassette.\nconfig.after_initialize do\n  PlansFinder.eager_load unless Rails.env.test?\nend\n```\nThe failure happens in the `pre-compile assets` phase.  Here is an example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/jobs/419644471#L830\n\n```\nD, [2020-01-29T23:28:23.810172 #2617] DEBUG -- : could not connect to server: Connection refused\nIs the server running on host \"127.0.0.1\" and accepting\nTCP/IP connections on port 5432?\nexcluded from capture: DSN not set\nrake aborted!\nPG::ConnectionBad: could not connect to server: Connection refused\nIs the server running on host \"127.0.0.1\" and accepting\nTCP/IP connections on port 5432?\n```\n\nThis is expected at this point because the image is being built for any environment and is not yet deployed to any of them.  Anything which requires a database connection must happen later - outside of the `pre-compile assets` phase. Specifically, the initializers are run during the `pre-compile assets` phase.\n\n### Proposal\n\n[This test commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/525/diffs?diff_id=75038595\u0026start_sha=e163aa1414572313a8deeeb61f326c61c4c09f76) fixes the problem and allows the image to be built and the application to start up.  However, since the plans are no longer pre-loaded, the app throws an error when accessing the login page.\n\nI'm proposing moving this code to a more appropriate place rather than deleting it.  Perhaps it can be run on first use, or at some other time after the application has already started up.\n\nI was unable to find a way to leave it where it is but wrap it in a conditional which would cause it to not run during an image build but run during normal app startup.  If anyone has an idea how to do that, it could be an alternate solution.\n\n### Result\n\nThe result should be that no database connections should happen during the `pre-compile assets` phase of the image build.  However, the plans must be loaded when a user connects to the login page.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\nThe next step is to get some ideas for the best way to do this, and discuss the best one.  At that point, we should create an MR against the default branch to implement that idea, and also test the change in the review branch here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/525 \n\n### How will we measure success?\n\nIf the image can successfully build, deploy, and start up, and the user facing functionality of the application is unchanged (the login page displays without errors), then this change will be successful.\n\n/cc @jameslopez

The subscription is cancelled and the customer is not able tu purchase another subscription for the same group\n1. The subscription is refunded and the customer is not able tu purchase CI minutes for it.\n\nIn order to address this, we will fix it in two separate MRs that correspond to the scenarios described above.\n\nThe main reason is that for the first scenario :one: the subscription portal currently listens for subscription callouts, so when a subscription is cancelled on the Zuora end we will get the callout and process it accordingly making it straightforward to recreate the fix.\n\nFor the second scenario :two: \n- A new `refund` endpoint needs to be created in the subscription portal\n- Some `refund callouts` need to be configured on the Zuora Payment Notifications end\n- Some questions need to be asked / answered to clarify the current refund process to establish what are the Zuora callouts we want to configure for refunds out of the available options (please see next section).\n- Some investigation is in progress to establish how to get a Zuora Subscription based o a Zuora Refund\n- Refunds and maybe some other objects need to be defined wihin the Subscription Portal to serve as an interface with the Zuora api. Ex: Refund is not one of the resources provided by IronBank\n\nBased on this, we want to ship :ship: these scenarios separately to:\n1. Deliver value in small incremental bits \n1. So the first part is not conditioned by the unknowns we have for the second\n\n### Things we need to answer :question: \n\n1. What is the process to add a new callout to Zuora in Production mode\n1. What are the current refunds that we handle, the 4 types available within Zuora notifications are:\n    1. `Credit Balance Refund Processed | Credit Balance Refund Processed`\n    1. `Credit Balance Refund Processed | External Credit Balance Refund Processed`\n    1. `Payment Refund Processed | External Payment Refund Processed`\n    1. `Payment Refund Processed | Payment Refund Processed`\n1. How to get from the parameters available in the Zuora Refund (Payments scope) to the Zuora Subscription to be able to map the refund to an existing order (In Progress by @vshumilo)\n1. How to get the type of Refund so we can differentiate between primary and secondary subscriptions (do not clear the subscription for the order if the refund is for ci minutes) (In Progress by @vshumilo)\n\n### Thank you!\n\nShoutout to @rdavila for an awesome collaboration :handshake: and taking the time to talk through the challenges for the new endpoint and adding so much value and insight.\n\n### The Promise :bulb: \n\nDocument the process to add a new callout to Zuora (if it is not already)\n\n### Result\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-26T21:12:09.635Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T14:12:21.921Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T15:17:52.705Z","closed_by":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"labels":["DEPRECATED Growth-Deliverable","EntApp Ecosystem","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","section::fulfillment","severity::3","support request","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"}],"author":{"id":786106,"username":"lyle","name":"Lyle Kozloff","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f94534d0df4ebb24d5634eb42548d8b4?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lyle"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1121","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1121","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1121/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1121/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1121","relative":"#1121","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1121"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31293994,"iid":1120,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Create a DB Schema Diagram for customers-gitlab-com","description":"### Problem\nWe do not have database schema diagrams documented for customers-gitlab-com.

In the interest of fixing that particular bug quickly to avoid CI errors, we decided to move forward with the solution of using `const_get(resource_name, false)`. See !972 for more information on the specific error and solution.\n\n### Proposal\nAnother potential solution would be to enable eager loading in Rails which would ensure those Zuora classes (and others) are loaded just as they are in Production.  It's worth considering the implications of enabling this setting in both environments.  A potential downside is the longer boot time in Rails but it might not be prohibitive.  Part of this issue should be reaching out to the team for consensus on this topic.  For perspective, the GitLab code base eager loads in the test environment but not development.\n\n### Result\nAll classes are loaded up front which is more consistent with Production usage.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-31T18:19:50.558Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:50.838Z","closed_at":"2021-06-25T00:49:57.990Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Provision","[deprecated] 🍎","auto closed","auto updated","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::problem validation"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1053","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1053","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1053/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1053/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1053","relative":"#1053","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1053"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30156960,"iid":1052,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Intermittent CI rspec failures with `IronBank::Authentications::Token::InvalidAccessToken`","description":"### Problem\nSince we've [enabled the `zuora_rest_api` feature flag by default in rspec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/916), we've seen flakiness in some tests with the error `IronBank::Authentications::Token::InvalidAccessToken`.\n\nHere's an example of the failure: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/jobs/420976521\n\n### Proposal\nThe credentials for the Zuora API user are valid so we should investigate what leads to this error.

more on Zuora object factories to create zuora records in tests","description":"The following discussion from !928 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @dstull started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/928#note_276608606):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **not blocking:** Wonder if we could leverage a `trait` in the `customer` factory to remove the need for   using the `create_zuora_account` helper here...and perhaps altogether as I see it defining instance variables and such as well - which I try to avoid doing in tests as they have a tendency to leak and lead to flaky testing.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e maybe something like this in the customer factory?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e     trait :with_real_zuora do\n    \u003e       zuora_account_id  { create(:z_account, :with_contact).id }\n    \u003e     end\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e then something like this in the `:z_account` factory?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e     trait :with_contact do\n    \u003e       after(:create) do |record|\n    \u003e         zuora_contact = create(:z_contact, account_id: record.id)\n    \u003e         create(:z_payment_method, account_id: zuora_account.id)\n    \u003e         record.update_attributes!(\n    \u003e           status: 'Active',\n    \u003e           bill_to_id: zuora_contact.id,\n    \u003e           sold_to_id: zuora_contact.id\n    \u003e         )\n    \u003e       end\n    \u003e     end\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e the above is just a start, but gets toward using factories a bit more\n\n\nThat being said, the main code smell comes from the `instance variables` of `module ZuoraTestHelpers`. So the ultimate goal is to eliminate all instance variables from `ZuoraTestHelpers`.\n\nBut this issue will limit the scope to be: add the FactoryBot for Zuora account, and use the factoryBot in `some` of the specs. \n\nTo achieve the ultimate goal of `removing all instance variables from ZuoraTestHelpers`, it requires lots of specs to re-run VCR re-recording. Due to the complexity and effort is non-trivial, we will avoid this part in this issue. We leave the ultimate goal in another follow-up issue [Remove instance variables from spec/support/helpers/zuora_test_helpers.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2306) for the next step.  BTW: with the MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2229 , we could already remove all `destroy_zuora_records` from `ALL` specs, per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2229#note_468181231. But this is not urgent. And it will naturally happen in issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2306 anyway.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-24T16:46:29.979Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:11:51.981Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T07:53:56.180Z","closed_by":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"labels":["Category:Purchase","[deprecated] 🍎","devops::fulfillment","group::purchase","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::verification"],"milestone":{"id":1233757,"iid":54,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.7","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:43:14.893Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:51:12.240Z","due_date":"2020-12-17","start_date":"2020-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/54"},"assignees":[{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1034","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1034","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1034/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1034/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1034","relative":"#1034","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1034"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29896946,"iid":1033,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Spike: Determine approach for creating restricted view of the customers database","description":"### Problem\nIn order to better protect customer data, we should enable restricted views of the customers database so GitLab team members can be removed from having access to production customer data, while still being able to support customer issues.\n\n\n### Proposal\n* Create a \"middle view\" where customer PII information is scrubbed from the database, allowing for debugging / troubleshooting without access to sensitive customer information. \n\nThis issue is to determine the technical approach and should involve reviewing the proposal with stakeholders to ensure we are solving the problem fully and correctly. \n\n\n### Result\nUnderstanding of next steps and technical implementation details","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-23T21:53:41.580Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T17:06:57.581Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T17:06:57.558Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"🤖 GitLab Bot 🤖","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["For Scheduling","PM Ready","[deprecated] Category:Provision","[deprecated] 🍎","auto closed","auto updated","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","priority::2","section::fulfillment"],"milestone":{"id":427853,"iid":10,"group_id":9970,"title":"Next 3-4 releases","description":"Bigger issues we plan to ship in the next 3-4 releases, but don't have a designated release yet. \r\n\r\n\u003e \"An easy way to look at it for me it's translating to months.

A few other engineers reported the same behavior so it doesn't seems to be a problem with a single dev environment.\n\n**Local Dev Rubocop Results:**\n```\n➜  customers-gitlab-com git:(staging) be rubocop\nInspecting 494 files\n.........................................................................................................................................................................CC.C...........C........C.C..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nOffenses:\n\ndb/migrate/20160408050701_add_devise_to_customers.rb:3:5: C: Rails/BulkChangeTable: You can combine alter queries using bulk: true options.\n    change_table(:customers) do |t|\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ndb/migrate/20160408063635_add_oauth_columns_to_customers.rb:3:5: C: Rails/BulkChangeTable: You can use change_table :customers, bulk: true to combine alter queries.\n    add_column :customers, :provider, :string #

This applies to both .com and self-managed subscriptions/licenses.\n\nNOTE: We're only doing this in the new Pajamas (vue) interface. \n\n![Resume_Subscriptoin](/uploads/9282c62d6bb5c98f48b220313ccdbd15/Resume_Subscriptoin.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-17T22:54:54.886Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T18:53:30.846Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T21:51:12.077Z","closed_by":{"id":2233420,"username":"pslaughter","name":"Paul Slaughter","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/631b25421eb206ab44cb2793ef09d881?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pslaughter"},"labels":["Deliverable","devops::growth","group::adoption DEPRECATED","keep confidential","priority::2","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1001916,"iid":44,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-15T20:54:50.875Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:04:41.671Z","due_date":"2020-03-17","start_date":"2020-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/44"},"assignees":[{"id":4303974,"username":"jejacks0n1","name":"Jeremy Jackson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303974/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jejacks0n1"}],"author":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4303974,"username":"jejacks0n1","name":"Jeremy Jackson","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303974/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jejacks0n1"},"user_notes_count":25,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1020","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1020","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1020/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1020/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1020","relative":"#1020","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1020"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":29713966,"iid":1019,"project_id":2670515,"title":"[Deprecate Zuora SOAP] Update test helpers and factories to use Zuora REST API","description":"### Problem\nThe test helpers in [zuora_test_helpers.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bcc08aba11dbdc6044635ef24bc257ac55a28aa4/spec/support/helpers/zuora_test_helpers.rb) and [stub_zuora_calls.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bcc08aba11dbdc6044635ef24bc257ac55a28aa4/spec/support/stub_zuora_calls.rb) are littered with `zuora_rest_api` feature flag logic.

15:34**?\n\n@aalakkad said: \n\n\u003e I'm not sure how easy it is to do that in rails_admin, for a quick search I found [a way](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32631342) to configure the date format, but I can't be sure if it has any implications for other parts of the system.\n\n\n### Result\n\nComfortable tables in the admin panel.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\nValidate the issue and schedule.\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-10T05:49:25.509Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T14:12:38.854Z","closed_at":"2020-09-09T18:41:01.066Z","closed_by":{"id":4024467,"username":"dbodicherla","name":"Dhiraj

[Raven.capture_exception](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-ruby/blob/ad440b952de0f62b62c42433882887c2cb678caf/lib/raven/event.rb#L181), the method checks itself whether the parameter is a exception or a string and will add backtrace if exists.\n\n Call `message = message.is_a?(String) ? message : message.inspect` after `Raven.capture_exception(message, extra: extra)` \n\n### Result\n\nThis will help in backtrace all the custom exceptions raised by the application.

I had a few comments for your consideration but this looks good.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e \u003e  Am hoping that we could get going with this approach, and write a patch the [find method in Queryable class](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/master/lib/iron_bank/queryable.rb#L8) to rescue such operations in a follow-up MR. Let me know what you think.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e It's definitely different behavior from `active_zuora`.  I'll throw this out for your consideration as well.  The `IronBank` behavior isn't all that different from `ActiveRecord`, right?  For example, if you use `find` on a model with a bad id, you get an error:\n    \u003e \n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \u003e Customer.find(nil)\n    \u003e ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Customer without an ID\n    \u003e from /Users/tyler/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/activerecord-5.2.3/lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb:433:in `find_with_ids'\n    \u003e \u003e Customer.find(123123123123123123123) # invalid id\n    \u003e ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Customer with an out of range value for 'id'\n    \u003e from /Users/tyler/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/activerecord-5.2.3/lib/active_record/core.rb:182:in `rescue in find'\n    \u003e Caused by ActiveModel::RangeError: 123123123123123123123 is out of range for ActiveModel::Type::Integer with limit 4 bytes\n    \u003e from /Users/tyler/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/activemodel-5.2.3/lib/active_model/type/integer.rb:53:in `ensure_in_range'\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \n    \u003e And with `IronBank` you have something like this:\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e \u003e Zuora::Account.find('123123123')\n    \u003e IronBank::NotFoundError: Body: {\"records\"=\u003e[], \"size\"=\u003e0, \"done\"=\u003etrue}\n    \u003e from /Users/tyler/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/iron_bank-4.3.1/lib/iron_bank/faraday_middleware/response/raise_error.rb:15:in `on_complete'\n    \u003e \u003e Zuora::Account.find(nil)\n    \u003e IronBank::NotFoundError: IronBank::NotFoundError\n    \u003e from /Users/tyler/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/iron_bank-4.3.1/lib/iron_bank/queryable.rb:9:in `find'\n    \u003e ```\n    \u003e Notice that ids that are not found also throw errors.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I'd honestly be ok leaving the `find` method as is, but we could implement a `find_by` method on `Zuora::Resource`.  This would be similar to the `active_find_by` on `Zuora::Subscription` (without the additional active condition).  So if we didn't want an error thrown, we could use something like `Zuora::Account.find_by(id: id)` which would be consistent with Rails.  WDYT?\n\nAs part of this work, we could review the codebase to look for places where the new `find_by` method could be used instead of `where().first`.  Also, if we implement a `find_by!` method, similar to [the `active_find_by!` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/87b0228b135dca04a53e151307fcdbb9cb5ba37c/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L18), which throws a `Zuora::RecordNotFound` error, we could clean up the implementation in a few places. For example, in [`CreateSalesforceOpportunityWorker#payment_amount`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/deeef4d1b6dd715f276b46a8b27c738ee7e6d634/app/workers/create_salesforce_opportunity_worker.rb#L54).","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-19T16:06:14.115Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T14:16:25.474Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T13:55:20.492Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler
