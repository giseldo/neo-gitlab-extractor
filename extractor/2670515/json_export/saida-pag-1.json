It was just discovered when investigating a [failed provision](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C049W1SNRV1/p1681866001597449) that this introduced a new bug which prevents to provision CI minutes if they weren't provisioned within the first two days of its purchase. It turned out that since CI minutes is a one time purchase, the effective period is only two days long:\n\n![Screenshot_2023-04-19_at_12.55.00_PM](/uploads/49ef20d07a3ef4263710e1081ad09770/Screenshot_2023-04-19_at_12.55.00_PM.png)\n\nBefore the mentioned issues was implemented, the CustomersDot's `Order` record and its `subscription` record was used. But with the fix the `current_subscription` is used. This led to the CI minutes not being returned after those two days because of this logic [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/bbc73401606fd0a45655c8c00b7f1cc35043192c/app/models/subscription.rb#L82) that only selects products where today's date is covered within their effective dates.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWhen filtering the products to be effective as of today, add a special condition to check if the product is CI minutes (`rate_plan_charge.rate_plan.product_rate_plan_id == Plan::CI_1000_MINUTES_PLAN`) AND today's date is greater or equal to the effective start date of the rate plan charge.\n\nWe could also set the effective end date to be the effective start date + 12 months which would be similar to how it's done on the [GitLab side](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a584f70cdeb9df7ecda3494daf696bf80d49c3ef/lib/add_ons/ci_minutes_params_generator.rb#L19).\n\n### Result\n\nReturn the correct amount of

CDot instead of using Customer data, and one area in particular for this epic is in Compliance.  We need to remove CDot's dependence on using the `country` attribute on the Customer model for compliance checks when a customer becomes a paid customer.  This allows CDot to more effectively manage BillingAccounts with multiple BillingAccountMemberships.\n\nIn particular, there are validations on this attribute on Customer model that should no longer apply for paid Customers.

There are Customer model validations that prevent a sale, pre-transaction.  There is also an \"EmbargoChecker\" service for specific countries (Russia, Belarus) and products (SM).  In both circumstances, the country field on the Customer model is used.  However as we want to embrace using Contact data for the Zuora Account when a Customer converts to paid, this logic will need to be updated.\n\nProvisioning is handled through a few services that process Zuora callouts: [ZuoraCallbackWorker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fdfe35c10eb1b72120f7732d69b19cece0172180/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb) and [SubscriptionTermStartWorker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/26741557a159d7d6c6a5084fe0fe06aa9aba2a3a/app/workers/zuora_callout/subscription_term_start_worker.rb).

This check should validate against the country of the Sold To and Bill To Contact.\n\n* Cuba\n* Iran\n* Democratic People's Republic of Korea\n* Sudan\n* Syria\n\nThis change can be released without the use of a feature flag as it can be applied independently of other changes mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6053#note_1347043834.\n\nCurrently callout workers fail at [this step](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1bbc5a161bc07335bf46c08b4b2364f3a73c8849/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L24) where the customer if either created or updated based on callout attributes.\n\n- [Sentry issue](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/4099448/?query=is%3Aunresolved%20country) for the `SubscriptionTermStartWorker`\n- [Sentry issue](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/4099799/?query=is%3Aunresolved%20country) for the ZuoraCallbackWorker\n\nWe should update these workers with code to verify country.

This is because those values are always overridden in [these lines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fdfe35c10eb1b72120f7732d69b19cece0172180/app/models/license.rb#L313-315) which are triggered in a [before validation callback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fdfe35c10eb1b72120f7732d69b19cece0172180/app/models/license.rb#L85).\n\nThe [original functionality](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5412) was implemented with a select of a customer on the manual Legacy License creation page. When a customer was selected, this override would kick in and no manual values were accepted in the form.\n\nWith the transition away from customers and to billing accounts, this functionality broke because when a subscription is present, the billing account will be present as well and results in triggering the override.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThere are (at least) two possible ways to resolve this:\n\n1. Introduce a billing account select in the Legacy License creation form to clearly enforce the override similar to how a select existed for customer in the past ([original MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5412)). This also means that if no billing account was selected, the entered data from the form has to be used. \n2.

memoize the `zuora_account_id` and `salesforce_account_id` values when loaded the first time from the billing account using an instance variable.\n\nGiven this memoization can happen in the same request when the associated `billing_accounts` collection for the customer can change + that instance variables are not reloaded on customer reload we end up with the wrong associated values for the entire request (the initial value).\n\n### Porposal\n\nRemove the memoization for `Customer#zuora_account_id` and `Customer#salesforce_account_id`.\n\nRollout this using the `remove_customer_account_ids_memoization` feature flag (in case we run into a significant slow down in queries). Note we are not expecting for this to impact significantly performance but want to be extra careful. We will leave the flag in place a couple of days and then drop it as part of this same issue.\n\n### Feature rollout using `remove_customer_account_ids_memoization` feature flag\n\n- [ ] MR removing the memoization is deployed to staging\n- [ ] MR removing the memoization is deployed to production\n- [ ] [Flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/206/edit) is enabled in staging (wait until next day to continue)\n- [ ] [Flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/206/edit) is enabled in production (wait 1 / 2 days to continue)\n- [ ] MR removing the feature flag is deployed to production\n- [ ] [Flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/206/edit) is disabled for all environments\n- [ ] [Flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/206/edit) is deleted","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-31T16:13:58.465Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T17:26:44.463Z","closed_at":"2023-04-10T17:26:44.438Z","closed_by":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"labels":["backend","bug::functional","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","section::fulfillment","type::bug","wontfix","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2910456,"iid":86,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.11","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-12-13T20:08:46.985Z","updated_at":"2022-12-13T20:08:46.985Z","due_date":"2023-04-17","start_date":"2023-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/86"},"assignees":[{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"}],"author":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6166","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/6166","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/6166/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/6166/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6166","relative":"#6166","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#6166"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":126074032,"iid":6164,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Remove unused additional_seat_price_per_year from upgrade_amendment_response","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

We need a way to identify ramp subscriptions created in production. Maybe we could check with the sales team on this.  \nKeep adding items to the tasks that need to be taken care in the monitoring stage i.e. post rollout of ramp subscriptions in production.\n\n## How to Monitor\n\nUse either of the processes below (not everyone might have access to Data Query). The output from both should be the same.\n\n### Using Zuora Data Query\n\nUse the following steps to check for ramp subscriptions in production:    \n\n1. Login to Zuora production through Okta.\n2. Create a new data query - https://www.zuora.com/platform/apps/data-query/queries/new\n3. Query to use - `select Subscriptionnumbers, * from orders o inner join ramp r on o.Id = r.OrderId LIMIT 10`.\n3. Run query.\n4. Copy any 1 subscription number.\n4. Search for this subscription number in Zuora subscriptions page - https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?menu=Z-Billing.\n4. Copy the corresponding Customer name.\n5. Sign in to Customers Portal production as admin user through Okta.\n6. Go to `Customers` tab in Customers Portal admin view.\n7. Search of the copied customer name.\n8. Impersonate the customer as admin to check that the ramp subscription card is shown properly with expected details and subscription management buttons hidden. Can use this [list of scenarios](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5384) to verify if the subscription card shows as expected.\n9. Repeat the above steps for 5 customers.\n\n\n### Using Zuora Report\n\nAdditional details in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6129#note_1332193491.\n\n1. Login to Zuora production through Okta.\n2. Go to Reports \u003e `Tatyana - Shared` \u003e `Subscriptions with Ramps` \u003e click Run Summary Report (most recently created subscriptions will be at the top).\n1. Copy `Sold To: Work Email` or `Account: Name`.\n5. Sign in to Customers Portal production as admin user through Okta.\n6. Go to `Customers` tab in Customers Portal admin view.\n7. Search of the copied customer email or name.\n8. Impersonate the customer as admin to check that the ramp subscription card is shown properly with expected details and subscription management buttons hidden. Can use this [list of scenarios](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5384) to verify if the subscription card shows as expected.\n9.

This model will hold `Zuora::Contact` data as well as the `zuora_contact_id` related to the object we want to save.\n\nA `BillingAccountContact` object will ultimately be the SSOT for customer contact details, which means that contact detail fields in `Customer` should also be present in `BillingAccountContact` (we may want to be consistent with the new Presenter introduced via [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6838)). \n\n`BillingAccountContact` objects will only be created to hold Bill to and Sold to contact data, given a `BillingAccount` object. This means that `BillingAccount#sold_to` and `BillingAccount#bill_to` references will have to be added: this mimics the architecture behind `Zuora::Account` (ie. access of these contact objects via `zuora_account.bill_to` and `zuora_account.sold_to`, even if they are the same object (which is often the case))\n\nWork on this issue should not be about implementation.\n\n### Result\n\nPassing

In this epic we will be introducing the concept of BillingAccount Contacts to CDot which will store data about the Bill To and Sold To Contacts for a BillingAccount.  More details can be found in this [proposal doc](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/contacts_management_proposal.md).  This new concept will have an impact on Compliance in CustomersDot.\n\nCompliance is performed in CDot in a few different ways at the moment:\n\n1. Visual Compliance (Sanctions Screening Tool)\n    - This tool screens purchaser information (name, country, and state (for USA/CAN purchasers only) against various sanctions and denied party lists, supplied from SFDC and creates an export hold in SFDC when a) a potential match is detected and/or b) for purchases originating from high risk countries. This screening occurs when an opportunity or quote is created in SFDC. \n    - This tool was briefly enabled in CDot in 2021 and then disabled because it blocked more purchases than expected (unnecessarily). For this reason, web direct purchasers are currently only screened post-purchase. \n    - Visual Compliance will be replaced by a new tool, Navex Risk Rate, in April 2023 in SFDC. Visual Compliance will be retired shortly thereafter. We plan to subsequently enable Risk Rate or an equivalent for web direct purchases, however, the plan is not yet defined. In the meantime, Risk Rate will screen these purchasers, post purchase as Visual Compliance does currently. \n    -   See [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4857) to remove Visual Compliance for non-Marketplace usage.\n2. EmbargoChecker service\n    - An internal control implemented per [Issue 4166](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4166), the [`EmbargoChecker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/43b599e2dc1d52d074d97da549167c2b44a8bf69/lib/embargo_checker.rb) verifies if a Customer's country or IP location is Russia or Belarus before allowing important actions, like updating or renewing a Subscription. \n    - This control ensures compliance with trade control laws implemented in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It, for example, prevents the customer's independent renewal of self-managed subscriptions, which are in most cases prohibited by export control law; and allows Legal an opportunity to identify, on a case-by-case basis, exceptions to that general prohibition, to screen individual customers in Visual Compliance/Risk Rate pre-purchase, and to screen the purchasers' paying bank (many of which have been sanctioned).  \n    - Note: the Embargo Checker is country-based and does not consider whether any given purchaser is identified on a sanctions list. \n3. Country validations on Customer record\n    - This validates the `country` field for a Customer record is not included in a hard-coded list, [`World::COUNTRIES_TO_REJECT`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f628a9a0ffc0d6a99181684bab3c417eb671d1a7/lib/world.rb#L32).\n\nAs seen above, the Customer record is used heavily for compliance, but as we introduce Sold To Contacts into CDot, this seems like the more appropriate object to use for Compliance checks.\n\n### Questions\n\nBefore going to far down ~\"workflow::solution validation\", we'd have some questions for ~\"group::compliance\".\n\n1. Thinking about the sales-assisted flow, if SFDC / Zuora have customer data for embargoed countries/companies, and sends a callout to CDot for provisioning, should it be allowed?\n    - For example, if CDot receives a callout where the SoldTo contact has a country of China, should CDot continue with provisioning access?\n2. What entity should be considered when thinking about compliance?\n    - Is it the individual that’s logged in (Customer) or the BillingAccount they belong to (SoldTo)?\n    - How is this done in SFDC? Is it based on Account address? SoldTo Address?\n3. What is the latest plan for RiskRate?\n    - Status update?\n    - How do we plan to use it for information generated via CDot (i.e. web direct flows)?\n\n### Results\n\nOnce we have answers to these questions, we can confidently update the [contacts management proposal doc](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/contacts_management_proposal.md) and create more issues for https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9831.","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-20T16:15:50.085Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T19:31:51.488Z","closed_at":"2023-04-18T16:55:55.976Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"labels":["backend","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","maintenance::refactor","missed:15.11","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2633524,"iid":80,"group_id":9970,"title":"16.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-05-30T16:25:25.778Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T16:25:25.778Z","due_date":"2023-05-17","start_date":"2023-04-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/80"},"assignees":[{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"user_notes_count":30,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6053","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/6053","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/6053/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/6053/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6053","relative":"#6053","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#6053"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9831,"epic":{"id":738847,"iid":9831,"title":"Improve Bill To / Sold To Contact Management in CustomersDot","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9831","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 31, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e3\u003c/strong\u003e months remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":125332906,"iid":6027,"project_id":2670515,"title":"QSR banner should only display if QSR is enabled","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

This is relevant even for creating/sending legacy licenses since they will pull Zuora contact info regardless of the email address entered into the form.\n\nIn the past, [this was a simple update/save](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/customersdot/associating_purchases.html#process).  Now, with some recent changes to the platform, its require the email addresses to be confirmed by the customer, even when changed through admin actions, and it creates kind of an undesirable scenario for both us and the customer.  We should be able to circumvent this from the admin side.\n\nFor one, cdot sends 2 emails out per change, an \"FYI this happened\" and a \"please confirm this happened\".  That's fine in a vacuum, but it may unintentionally be spamming the customer, especially if the email address is being changed only temporarily.  For two, it breaks our workflow to \"Change the email in the new account for example: person@example.com to person_edited@example.com\"; `person_edited` is not a real address and therefore can't get the confirmation email, but that's sort of the point with that workflow to swap addresses around.\n\nAlso, I notice it updates Zuora BTST immediately, even when cdot still reflects the previous email address.  That may or may not be intentional?\n\n## What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nFrom the admin side, we should be able to update contact information without relying on the customer to confirm their address.  Or, we should have the means to confirm it for them without email.  In a perfect world, we should never need to change cdot contact info for them, but there are many relevant reasons for why support needs to change cdot info on behalf of the customer\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIn some cases, you can change the email to update Zuora, send the license, then update it back in cdot.

For e.g. when upgrading a subscription, multiple amendments to Renew, Add product and Remove product will be generated. The latest version of the subscription may or may not be the Renewal amendment. Thus, when Zuora triggered a callback, the `amendment_types` attribute may or may not include `RenewSubscription`.\n\nTo circumvent this limitation, the method `Subscription#recently_renewed_with_multiple_amendments` was introduced to check if any of the amendments associated with the last transaction subscription included a `Renewal`.\n\nThe method is used when sending [online cloud notification](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/services/online_cloud_license_notification_service.rb#L14) email. Now that all renewals occur using Orders API, the first condition `renewal_amendment` should return `true` when the transaction included a Rewewal- as [`amendment_types` callback attribute](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb#L47) includes all [order action types translated into respective amendment types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb#L41).\n\nConsequently, the `Subscription#recently_renewed_with_multiple_amendments` method should be ready to cleanup.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~\"Enterprise Applications\" team if Zuora business logic is involved. --\u003e\n\nBefore dropping the method, confirm the method is no longer being used:\n\n- [x] Add a logger in the [`recently_renewed_with_multiple_amendments?` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/models/subscription.rb#L618) to ensure the code path does not reach the point when `base_subscription_id` is returned. This will confirm Amend API is not used for any of the existing workflows where the cloud notification is sent\n- [x] Verify for all Renewal use cases `OnlineCloudLicenseNotificationService#execute` sends appropriate email (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5944#note_1313873775)\n\n- [x] Once above two verification is complete, the method can be dropped (and inclusion of logger module).\n\n### Result\n\nCleanup of unused code.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-09T17:59:49.001Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T19:46:53.627Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T19:46:53.598Z","closed_by":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"labels":["backend","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","maintenance::removal","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2745651,"iid":85,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:22.132Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:22.132Z","due_date":"2023-03-17","start_date":"2023-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/85"},"assignees":[{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"}],"author":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5944","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":3,"completed_count":3},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5944","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5944/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5944/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5944","relative":"#5944","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5944"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9502,"epic":{"id":682911,"iid":9502,"title":"Cleanup Subscribe and Amend API workflows","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9502","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":125052325,"iid":5935,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Display a unique identifier in the Billing Account search list","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace\n- http://localhost:5000\n\nShould we consider to hide this page on production server(https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace)?\n- For openapi doc purpose, staging server is enough for people to understand and try/play with the APIs\n- I think we do not expect anyone will play those APIs on production server. \n   - It is dangerous. If people `place order` from the production page, it does **not** go through Marketplace partner's system. there is no history on partner's system to audit -- which is not expected I think. \n   - It does not bring too much convenience either. People needs to have Marketplace partner's **production client_id/client_secret** to be able to try the APIs on production page https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace. \n      - For GitLab developers, if for issue investigation, we would directly get that data from DB, rather than `get client_id/client_secret from DB, and then go back to the web page to try`.\n\nSo, the proposal is, hide the production page https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace. It is only available on non-production environmebnt(staging, localhost, stag-ref)\n   - another option is: disable `try it out` feature on production. -- I do not prefer this option, because: unless we have an easier way to switch it off, it may require us to maintain a separate copy of [marketplace_openapi.yaml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/api/marketplace_openapi.yaml)\n\n\nBTW: the [Marketplace partners overview page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/partner_marketplace.html#marketplace-api-specification) only link to staging server(https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace)\n\n### Problem\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~\"Enterprise Applications\" team if Zuora business logic is involved. --\u003e\n\n### Result\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-04T00:43:04.551Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T16:26:11.875Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T07:20:39.954Z","closed_by":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"labels":["Category:Fulfillment Integrations \u0026 Visibility","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","priority::4","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":2745651,"iid":85,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:22.132Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:22.132Z","due_date":"2023-03-17","start_date":"2023-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/85"},"assignees":[{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"}],"author":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5869","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5869","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5869/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5869/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5869","relative":"#5869","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5869"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":124704198,"iid":5862,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Refactor Salesforce object creation logic to remove references of Subscribe and Amend API","description":"The following discussion from !6635 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @qzhaogitlab started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6635#note_1298549447):  (+2 comments)\n\n    \u003e **sorry another question**: this [code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/7c69ad620b411f58fe3d1370fba65f6826c15439/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_objects_service.rb#L58-65) might be able to clean up. \n    \u003e \n    \u003e Am I right that, it should not go to this condition `elsif amendments.empty?` any more?

As it already invokes the `handle_new_subscription` method if `CreateSubscription` order action is present, the objects should be created as expected. MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6696\n- [x] remove method #handle_existing_subscription and #create_objects_for_existing_subscription in favor of #handle_with_zuora_order in Salesforce::CreateQuoteObjectsService (MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6721) \n\n**Parameter changes**:\n\n- [x] `amendments` parameter can be dropped as well as Orders API does not pass `amendments`.  (MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6721) \n- [ ] ~~`order_number` is currently an optional parameter.

With the transition to Orders API, this description was set in the charge overrides, accessible in Rate plan charge record (source: [`AddProduct`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/param_constructor/add_product.rb#L73), [`UpdateProduct`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/param_constructor/update_product.rb#L28) order actions)\n\nHowever, while calculating the renewal price, we use the [count of amendments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/eoa_starter_bronze/offer_renewals_count_service.rb#L14) that have description set to `'EoA Bronze / Starter Price Uplift'`. It does not account for the charge overrides, which can result in a lower count and thereby returning the lower tier price.\n\nThis should likely not have an impact as of now, as we transitioned to Orders API for renewals on [January 19th](use_orders_api_subscription_update_workflow). For all EoA starter / bronze renewals following it, the count of description in amendment records represent the correct count.
