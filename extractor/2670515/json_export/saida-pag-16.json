I also would like to point that we will connect Pajamas Design System via Node.js packaging system (`@gitlab/ui`).\n\n### Proposal\n\nMove styles processing to `webpacker` too.\n\nNote: moving to webpacker is also on the CSS roadmap for the GitLab project. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/950#css-roadmap \n\n### Result\n\nThis will make the process of moving to Pajamas easier.

Ask user if we can charge the card on their behalf for the additional users.\n1. Change the namespace to \"free\" in Gitlab.com admin\n1. Try associating the namespace with the subscription in the customers portal\n1. If the system is charging for all users and not crediting for the previously paid users, create an SE issue to see if there is a conflict causing this\n1.

Hide the coupon field on production and only show for dev/staging instances.\n2. Hide the coupon field behind a URL, and document how to access the URL for testing purposes.\n3. Suggestions welcome.\n\nMake sure this is properly communicated with the sales team. \n\nWe should also ensure that a CC is not required when adding a coupon.

but isn't as accurate as `Date.current` and `Time.current` which uses Rails timezone configuration (UTC in our case) instead of using the system configured time.

Allow users to visit GitLab.com plan pages (https://gitlab.com/profile/billings or https://gitlab.com/groups/GROUPNAME/-/billings) and activate a trial.\n2. A user should have the option of starting a 30-day Gold trial.\n3. On clicking on the trial CTA, a form similar to the free trial form (https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/) should be displayed to capture lead information, which is pushed to SF.\n4. On submitting the form, the trial is activated. A user should be redirected to the billing page and see a banner notifying them that they're on a Gold trial, and when this trial expires. This banner should persist until the trial expires.\n5. After 30 days, the trial is deactivated. The trial option should no longer be presented on the billing page, and a user should not be able to obtain another trial for a user or group that's had a trial before.\n\nDuring the trial, users should receive a nurture campaign similar to our existing campaign for self-managed trials.\n\nA user should also be able to upgrade their account to a paid account during the trial. \n\n## Open questions\n\n* Are we doing trials at each subscription level?\n\nNo. The trial is for Gold only.\n\n* Are we allowing trials for individuals, groups, or both?\n\nBoth. Accounts should get 1 trial, which can be applied to a personal namespace or a group.\n\n* Should we change `pricing` and consider a separate flow for a new, unregistered user?\n\nYes, in a separate issue. This should only apply to existing users. \n\n* How does nurture messaging from Marketo and Outreach fit in?\n\nTBD.\n\n* How will the new form interface with SFDC?\n\nWe should push these leads to SFDC in the same way we do in https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/, in the new free trial form.
